[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.200]   We had just started, in our last class period, talking about life-family cycles.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:22.520]   And we want to pick up there, and we had talked about early marriage, that is prior to children,
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:30.640]   and then right after that is when children come in, to the picture, which is the expanding
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.560]   family.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.080]   And we're on to life cycle number three, which is another aspect of the expanding family,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.400]   when the children become school age.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.480]   And again, we're saying approximately this is ages between 28 and 35, when the kids reach
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.880]   this particular time, and there is a whole set of unique dynamics that are going on at
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.160]   this time, that we are going to call developmental paths again.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.520]   So what's happening to a family where the kids now are off to school, maybe they go
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.280]   to a Christian school, maybe they go to a public school, or maybe the school room's
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.000]   right there in their own home, but they still have a certain number of hours during the
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.560]   day where mom is usually the one overseeing the school work or they're off to school at
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.400]   some other location.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.920]   So you've got things going on here, like adjusting to the first child entering school.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.920]   When that happens, you don't spend as much time just randomly spending personal time
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.000]   with the child, that child's now preoccupied with their studies and work, and if mom and
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.400]   dad are homeschooling, then there's a lot of intense work and preparation and setting
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.040]   up class schedules and curriculum that's going on there that's different.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.160]   Everything changes.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.440]   Or if that child's off to school, then you have a tendency to wonder, how's it going
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.920]   with the input that's coming from the teacher?
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.940]   How's my child adjusting to friends at school and interacting within that environment?
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.560]   So there's adjusting to that, and then there's this adjustment to the last child entering
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.280]   school as well, when all of a sudden the home is empty again if they go off to school.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.960]   If they're being homeschooled, of course the home's not empty, but usually it's a lot quieter
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.120]   because they usually have their little work-study areas where they go to, and they have to read
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.280]   or study or write papers or do drawings.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.960]   So usually things are a lot quieter around the home.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.040]   And then there's adjustment, sometimes if children are sent off to work, a lot of Christian
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:06.360]   families do this, usually a wife will actually re-enter the workforce.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.800]   That is, she gets a job, more often than not it's a part-time job, to kind of supplement
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.280]   the family income, and she's away from the house during the day, but usually they have
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.480]   it planned out in such a way where either dad or mom gets home around 3 or 3.30 in the
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.240]   afternoon when the kids get home and get off the bus, and so they're there to welcome them
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.680]   when they get home, but a lot of families live with that as well.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.120]   And this is just a daily routine that they go through.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.280]   Now one of the big struggles that go along with this is learning how to balance multiple
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.520]   roles.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:53.600]   At work, with your husband or wife, at church, with the family, with the community, there's
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.240]   all kinds of different things that are going on there, and different roles that the husband
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.320]   or wife are involved in, sometimes they're a part of Bible studies at church, or sometimes
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.620]   they're a part of ministries, a children's ministry at church, or they're a part of a
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.200]   high school or a junior high ministry at church, and so they have different roles there, maybe
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:26.600]   they lead a Bible study in their own home, so they have a role that they take up there.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.160]   So there's an adjustment to all these things that are going on, and not only does mom and
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.240]   dad usually have a busy personal schedule, but the kids, because of their school responsibilities
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.360]   and homework and so on, they also are extremely busy, so the family now is divided in several
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.960]   different directions.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.680]   Now in counseling, you've got to understand that.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.680]   When you get a couple that comes to you that's at this particular stage of life where the
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.160]   children are school age, these are some of the issues that they're going to be facing.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.560]   There's also adjusting to this phase of child rearing, where if the kids are going off to
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.680]   school, whether it's Christian school or public school, they're usually coming home with new
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:18.000]   attitudes and new vocabulary, and that's going to change things a lot, in fact it may not
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.460]   be very pleasant vocabulary, this is not something that you say around the house, and it's not
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.360]   something that you want in your Christian home, so you have to end up challenging that
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.000]   vocabulary.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.640]   Sometimes they come home with attitudes that you've never seen them have before.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.520]   Usually they've had very pleasant attitudes, but now that's changed.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.880]   Or maybe you've had a very compliant child, but now that child is starting to show some
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.000]   resistance.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.360]   They're going to challenge mom and dad and what mom and dad thinks, because they think
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:08.200]   they're pretty hot stuff now that they're in school, or so they think.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.160]   So there's this adjustment to this phase of child rearing.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.240]   Now oftentimes at this particular stage also dad is going through a readjustment in terms
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.320]   of his career goals.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.760]   Usually he's fairly well-established in his job, of course there are certain exceptions
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.960]   to that, but usually fairly well-adjusted in his job, and he's starting to climb the
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.240]   corporate ladder, so to speak, and get certain advancements in his job, but he has mixed
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.720]   feelings about it.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.920]   There are good things that he likes about the job, and there are things he doesn't like
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.200]   about the job, and he's frequently saying to his wife when he comes home in the evening,
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:56.280]   "You know what, I'm not sure I could see myself doing this the rest of my life," which puts
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.960]   a little bit of panic in her heart, "You're not going to resign your job, are you?
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.560]   That's our income, and we got to be able to feed the kids.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.300]   I don't know whether I'm really cut out to do this forever, is this really what I really
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.980]   want to do?"
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.040]   So there's all kinds of readjustments going on there.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.040]   Then it's at this particular stage that you begin to relate to your parents as fellow
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.040]   adults.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.640]   There's a change there as well.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:35.600]   All of your life you related to them as a child, or as a young man or young woman, and
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.720]   now you're relating to your parents as fellow adults, because you're rearing your own children
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   now.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.720]   You're making your own decisions, and most of the time you're making these decisions
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.240]   almost entirely on your own.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.640]   Occasionally you may consult them for their wisdom, but most of the time it's on your
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.640]   own.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.600]   So how do you relate to them that way?
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.140]   Certainly one of the ways you can relate in a positive way is by tapping some of their
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.920]   wisdom as parents.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:14.300]   They've gone through this stage of life before with you, and they learned some things that
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.080]   should be done and things that should not be done during that particular phase or stage
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.080]   of life.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:30.320]   So you can do that, but also you can learn from their negative examples, not just their
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.000]   positive examples.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.560]   In fact, mom and dad will probably say, "You know, if I had to do over again, I would have
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.440]   done this."
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.620]   Sometimes that's the best thing you can learn from them, and that's okay.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.580]   So they're now sharing with you things that they've never shared with you before because
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.560]   you were too young to even hear them or even appreciate them, but now that you're facing
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:59.320]   these very same problems in your life with the children and the challenges of school
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:08.040]   and the responsibilities of a job and career and so on, this is all new.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.100]   And then, here's a biggie.
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:16.420]   At this particular stage of life, you begin to realize that you have to adjust your goals
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:22.700]   and dreams to reality.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.820]   Usually when a person is younger, they think they're going to set the world on fire.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.820]   That's what they believe.
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:35.440]   "Wow, I am God's answer to the world."
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:41.660]   And they find out that God has a much more modest plan for their life.
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:46.900]   Oh, God's still going to use them and still going to use them in a very impactful way,
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:52.180]   but it's not the big way that they thought it was going to be.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:57.460]   And so they begin to readjust their goals and their dreams to reality.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:03.380]   I thought we'd be here at this particular stage financially in our home, or I thought
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:09.780]   we'd be this far along in my career, or I thought we'd be this far along in our spiritual
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.640]   development and growth as a family and as a couple, and they're beginning to realize,
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.280]   you know, we're not even close to some of these goals.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.280]   That's okay.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.900]   The fact that you are growing, you are changing, and you realize you need to grow and change
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:32.240]   is probably the most significant thing there.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.800]   So what we're saying is families that come into counseling can be somewhat disillusioned
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:45.880]   about life, and you have to take that into account when you're working with them.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.560]   Why are they disillusioned?
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.320]   What's the major struggle that's going on in their life?
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:00.080]   So, which really brings us to the strains and temptations, what are they?
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:07.800]   Well, one of them is that, as I've mentioned, there's financial strains, automobile, family
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.800]   necessities.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:19.460]   As the kids get older, they need special treatment medically, dental treatment.
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:26.360]   You realize you have to mortgage your house in order to get braces for the kids, you know,
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.520]   and their teeth.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:34.960]   You almost have to sell your firstborn in order to repair the car.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:40.560]   There's major things going on there that are financial strains.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.360]   And then there's a lot of decisions about education here at this stage.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.640]   Well, should we send our kids to Christian school here in the area?
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.800]   Should we homeschool our kids?
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.320]   The positive side is we have a lot of input directly into how our kids develop and their
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.800]   growth and development.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.440]   The negative side of it is it's very time demanding.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.780]   Do we have enough time to spend and do all of this?
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.920]   What about the public school system?
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:19.240]   Some Christian parents say, "Listen, I've reared my kids to think and live like a Christian.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.840]   I want them to learn how to be salt and light out there in the world, and I'm not going
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:30.440]   to teach them how to be salt and light by keeping them behind closed doors or keeping
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.800]   them in purely a Christian environment.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.760]   I want to send them out in a sense into the world and learn how to live among people of
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:44.800]   the world so they can be a testimony to the world."
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:52.440]   I remember several years ago when I was pastoring, we had a very large Christian school there
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.440]   in our area.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.200]   It was the largest one in the country, and several of the members of the leadership of
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.360]   that school came to our church, and we had a lot of families that sent their kids to
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.680]   the Christian school system, and then we had a number of families that sent their kids
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.760]   to the public school system, and we had a whole other group of families that homeschooled
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.080]   their kids.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:23.400]   Generally, now I'm speaking generally, the kids that had the most dynamic testimony in
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.880]   the youth group were the kids that went to the public school system, and one day we sat
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.080]   down with the pastoral staff and we were talking about this, and I remember our conversation
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.680]   and the flow of it.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.200]   Why is that so?
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.120]   Why are the kids that are coming out of the public school system have such a dynamic testimony
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.540]   for Christ?
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.880]   And the conclusion that we came to was that every day they went into that public school
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:56.200]   system, they faced criticism and ridicule for their faith, and they had to make a decision
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.660]   that day, "Am I going to stand with Christ, or am I going to be a chameleon and act like
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.400]   everybody else in the world?"
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.800]   And it's that decision that they had to make every day that made them firm in their Christian
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.840]   stand, and to make that firm.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.200]   I'm not saying that public school system is the only way to go.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.640]   I'm not saying that at all, okay?
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:25.440]   So don't bring out your theological guns and aim them at me, okay?
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.280]   Because there was a period of time where we sent our kids to the Christian school and
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.120]   we also homeschooled our children.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.840]   I think that is an individual decision that parents have got to make, and they've got
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.440]   to do it.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.360]   They know their kids.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.880]   There are certain things, certain circumstances that are going on in those children's lives
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.400]   that may be unique, and so they'll need a unique approach.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.800]   Some kids fit real well in a Christian school, and we really recommend that.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:04.520]   Other kids are just very dynamic, and they stand on their own really well and think through
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.200]   things really well, so they function real well in a public school system.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:17.480]   Other children, I will say this, when we homeschooled our kids, I don't think that they're...
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.540]   I think that they developed scholastically a lot faster when they were homeschooled.
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.540]   I can say that.
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:29.240]   There's certainly a very positive side to that scholastic development.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.040]   In fact, for several years, we homeschooled the kids, and we finally sent it to a public
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.160]   school system because there were so many things that that school system could do in the area
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:45.520]   of biology and science and stuff like that that we couldn't do in a home situation.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:51.360]   Not even with our cooperative homeschool environment there, we couldn't do that same thing.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.160]   By the time they went from homeschooling into that public school system, the kids at their
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.040]   grade level thought our kids were geniuses, and they weren't.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040]   They were not geniuses.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.640]   We didn't raise four geniuses, but they thought that they were because their homeschooling
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.240]   had trained them so well in comparison to what they had received in the public school
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.240]   system.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:16.620]   What I'm saying is there's plus and a minus to every system, and parents have to weigh
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.280]   those type of things out.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.940]   This particular family is going through that kind of struggle.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.440]   Some missionaries in different parts of the world, they can't send their kids to the public
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.920]   school system, and it's impossible to do that.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.880]   They have to homeschool.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:40.680]   Sometimes they opt for video school in terms of homeschooling or some other means, so they
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.520]   just can't do it.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.920]   All we're highlighting here is the fact that at this particular stage of life where the
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.440]   kids are school age, the parents face this kind of a struggle, and they actually may
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:57.920]   come to you for counsel on what do you think is the best thing to do, what's the best way
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:05.800]   we can be good stewards of the short amount of time that we have with our kids.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:11.280]   There's another issue that they face, a strain, husbands being away from home with outside
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.040]   activities for the kids.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:25.520]   Usually kids get involved in a lot of things, ice skating, swimming lessons, karate lessons,
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.560]   soccer, football.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.720]   There's all kinds of things that kids get involved in, and you find yourself being a
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:40.480]   shuttle all over the place, and the husband usually works late at night or well into the
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.240]   evening with a high demanding job.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.920]   So that brings up some strains, and then you begin to realize the kids are getting old
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:18:01.440]   enough to really get into some real good conflicts, struggles, sibling rivalry, arguments.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:07.120]   Now I know this never happened in your home, but it certainly did in our home.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:13.320]   I'll never forget when our boys were first introduced to Nintendo and what that did to
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.200]   them.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.680]   So there's arguments like that that can occur.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:31.280]   There's difficulty managing children, and each child you have to treat individually
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:37.000]   because they each have their own little strengths and weaknesses, their own little temptations,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.200]   and sometimes you can't cookie cutter kids in child rearing.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:50.480]   You've got to be wise, not any more than you like to be cookie cuttered at your job or
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:57.600]   even at church, and you are just considered to be one among many people, all the same
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.600]   type of people.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   No, you don't like that.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.720]   You want to be treated as an individual, and your kids are the same way.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.080]   So there's difficulty in managing the kids.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.280]   You begin to realize there's a lot of things that are going by in life that are going by
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.160]   so fast that you don't have any...you realize there's a lot of unfulfilled tasks.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.520]   I'm not getting everything done that I need to get done.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.060]   And sometimes people will come, husbands, wives will come and talk with you about the
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.920]   guilt that they have of all these unfinished tasks.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.760]   I'm not getting this done, I'm not getting that done, I'm not being a responsible husband
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:37.360]   or parent or wife or mother.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:44.660]   And again, as I hinted at before, under the developmental tasks, there's dissatisfaction
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.480]   with job and career.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.680]   Husbands beginning to rethink things usually at this stage, "Is this what I really want
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.840]   to do for the rest of my life?"
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:20:00.520]   And there's a certain discouragement and difficulty that occurs in the job.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.520]   Or there's promotion or new responsibilities and demands of the job, and maybe even there's
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.360]   a decision to make a career change.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:15.960]   "Now, this is not the job that I want, I want to get another one.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.800]   So what's going on with that career change?"
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.960]   And when kids start into school, whether it's homeschool, Christian school, public school,
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:32.280]   whatever the case, you find that you have to handle behavioral or learning problems
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.560]   of the kid.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.120]   Behavioral or learning problems.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:46.800]   This becomes a challenge because every parent expects all their kids to be geniuses.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.960]   And they find out that they're not.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.840]   In fact, our kids have a learning difficulty.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.560]   And how am I going to deal with that learning difficulty?
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.080]   When I was a boy, I was totally dyslexic.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.000]   In fact, if you took my third grade papers and you held them up to a mirror, you could
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.640]   read them perfectly.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.600]   I wrote everything exactly backwards.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.000]   Switch things in my mind.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.560]   And so my mother still has some of those papers.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:26.680]   And she reminds me, keeps me very humble, of those papers.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.320]   You could read everything backwards.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:34.160]   I used to jokingly say, "Of all the things in seminary that I excelled at, of all the
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.480]   things, it was Hebrew that I excelled the most."
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   I did.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.840]   I loved Hebrew and it just came to me very naturally.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:50.400]   And I often wondered whether or not it was because of my dyslexia because now I'm finally
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:56.280]   reading the direction that I want to read, all right, from the opposite direction.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.400]   It was just natural for me to read that direction.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.400]   I don't know.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.520]   I don't know whether there's any substance to that whatsoever.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.040]   But you find out your kids have learning problems.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:14.320]   And they're not catching on to things quite as well and they need special work.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:21.520]   And I remember I had so many problems with this when I was in third grade that I would
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.520]   have nightmares at night as a kid.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.840]   I'd wake up in the middle of the night screaming.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:33.040]   I'd have nightmares about my schoolwork because it was driving me crazy.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.000]   And they'd give me all these IQ tests and stuff and I would score very well on those.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.040]   That was no problem.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:46.640]   But until they discovered that I had this problem with dyslexia and because I was seeing
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.280]   things completely different than what the other kids in class were looking at.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.920]   So you're going to find out your kids are like that and you're going to minister to
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.560]   people whose kids who have problems like that.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.560]   And these parents are going to be very discouraged, disheartened.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.720]   This is not what they had planned for their life.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.160]   They've got other things that they had planned that they wanted to do.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.760]   Well, all of this is a part of rearing children in a godly way and being a good steward with
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.320]   your child.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:22.920]   So handling these behavioral or learning problems of the kids.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.160]   You may raise two or three kids and they're generally obedient kids.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:35.600]   I mean, they do well, but also you may have one kid that decides to be the little rebel.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.200]   And this kid demands all of your time.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.840]   This little rebel just challenges you every step of the way.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.360]   The rest of the kids, they are well behaved.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.440]   And frequently in parenting conferences I get this question, what do you do with a kid
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440]   like that?
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.680]   And actually those kind of kids don't bother me a whole lot and I don't think they should
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.960]   bother parents a whole lot.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.280]   Yes, they are more demanding.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.000]   Yes, they're going to demand more time.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.480]   That's usually the frustration with parents.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.440]   They're not willing to give that time and they've got to learn that that's just what
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.880]   they got to do.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.760]   But those parents or those children are just being really upfront.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.800]   They're just being who they are.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.920]   They're laying everything on the table.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.920]   This is the way they are.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.080]   And I'd rather deal with a kid like that than the sweet little kid that sits back and always
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.520]   obeys but on the inside is a little rebel.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:36.840]   In the long run, that kid is the more dangerous kid because they're not being genuine.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.240]   They're hiding themselves and you don't see that kid really come to the surface until
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.760]   they have a little bit of autonomy later on in adolescence.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.160]   And all of a sudden the parents are saying, "I don't understand.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.040]   This kid has always been an obedient kid.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.320]   I don't know why he or she would ever do this."
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.840]   Well, because they tended to ignore that kid and focus on the kid that constantly gave
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.720]   them problems.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:08.400]   When you need to address the hearts of every single kid in that family, it's not just the
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.920]   one that's real demanding.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:17.480]   You think about the one that's always obedient and always wants to make mom and dad happy.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:25.440]   In the long run, I think that's a more dangerous kid because you can easily lose that kid over
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.440]   the years.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.320]   They sit in the back and they're very quiet and they don't have a whole lot to say but
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:39.300]   inside their heart is really going a completely different direction and that never gets challenged.
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:45.920]   So you're not just handling learning problems but you're also handling behavioral problems
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.600]   with kids.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.520]   There's the challenge.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.940]   Which brings us to life cycle number four, which is the maturing family.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:04.960]   Probably parents approximate ages 35 to 45, this is families with teenagers.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:10.560]   During this particular stage of life, as the parents grow older, they begin to reevaluate
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.760]   their career again.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:22.580]   For the first time, all of a sudden, mom begins to experience menopause.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:30.200]   I tell men, usually in counseling, "Don't dread menopause.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:37.640]   For the first time in your life, your wife will be the same temperature as you."
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.680]   You know how she's always cold and you're always hot?
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:46.600]   Well, when she goes through menopause, you'll both be hot, okay?
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.840]   So she's always freezing.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:55.640]   When she goes through menopause, now you'll both and you'll say to her, "This is the way
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.040]   I've been all of my life."
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:04.780]   At least you only have to experience it for a short amount of time.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:11.660]   So handling menopause and all the difficulties that go along with that, there's a reassessment
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.400]   of the marriage, usually during this time.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.580]   What's the progress?
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:24.940]   What's the satisfaction of the marriage when the kids become teenagers?
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.180]   You find the kids are usually off on their own.
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.900]   They have a little bit of their own freedom now where they can get out and maybe a vehicle
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:37.100]   and then go places and now mom and dad's left at home by themselves in the evening, lots
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.100]   of time to spend together.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.700]   For people who have made major good investments in their marriage, they look forward to that
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:44.700]   time.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.700]   For other people who have not made investments in their marriage, they don't know what to
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:52.660]   do at that time.
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.420]   So there's a reassessment.
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:04.860]   Usually it's during this time that most couples stabilize their finances and their resources.
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:11.500]   This is the time where they really begin to make money that they can put away for later
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:18.940]   on future health issues or retirement.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:24.780]   This is where they begin to do that.
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.740]   Another developmental task at this particular stage is accepting individual differences
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:33.340]   with your mate, with your children.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.300]   Children are now become opinionated.
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.140]   They may or may not accept everything that mom and dad believe.
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:43.460]   You find out whether or not your child maybe made a profession of faith in Christ years
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:49.920]   before, but the real fruit of that is beginning to bear out at this stage of life.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.640]   You begin to find out, "No, wait a minute.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.880]   Maybe my child doesn't know Christ."
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:59.180]   You're going through a lot of doubts, going through a lot of questions, and those questions
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:07.540]   may be serious enough that they really don't know the Lord, which tells us whether or not
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:18.620]   years before that was a real genuine commitment to Christ as Savior and Lord.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:25.280]   So there's differences there.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:32.520]   It's at this particular stage of life in our home that my wife really became a believer
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.840]   when our child became young teenagers.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:43.740]   Now, we thought she was a believer prior to this, but she wasn't.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:49.280]   I shared with you that story, didn't I, a little bit about her teaching that classroom
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:54.160]   of girls and how she wanted to share with them the gospel.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.860]   Well, it's this particular stage of life that that happened.
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:03.640]   And then there's a shift of priorities in view of lifetime remaining.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:07.920]   You realize that life's going by pretty quickly and you only have a short amount of time,
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:13.120]   and you begin to think through, "Okay, what am I doing that's really worthwhile and really
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:19.200]   is good for the kingdom of God, and what are the things that are peripheral things that
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.560]   I'm spending a lot of time with, but it really isn't advancing God's kingdom, it's not advancing
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.280]   my family, not advancing my wife or our children.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.280]   What's going on here?"
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:34.880]   So there's a shift here in your priorities.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:44.720]   And then there's also handling the increased independence of the children.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.840]   That's difficult to do, too.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:55.520]   Now the kids are not as directly under your influence all the time, they're off with one
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.000]   activity after another.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.060]   Usually the church adds to those activities even more, youth group activities and Bible
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:09.680]   studies, and there's just an awful lot of stuff that's going on during this time.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.480]   And so the kids aren't around as much.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.080]   Some parents, they enjoy having the kids out of the house.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:22.240]   Other parents, it's a little bit more difficult for them.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.320]   You know, they really miss having the kids around.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.320]   They're gone.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.640]   The house is a lot quieter.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.760]   Used to be your house was like a revolving door on the front door.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.420]   Kids going in and out, all kinds of action happening.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.900]   Now it's quiet all the time.
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:44.820]   And some couples have a difficulty handling the quietness.
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:48.940]   And then you begin to learn how to accept a new role with the children.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:59.020]   It's much less of a controlling structural role.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:12.100]   You realize that your role in their lives is shifting to that as of being an advisor,
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:20.380]   where they come and seek your wisdom, not necessarily your rules.
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:24.700]   Before you used to pass rules and you'd have a very structured home and you have certain
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.460]   things that these kids could do or not do.
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:32.100]   Now they're getting old enough where you're letting back, letting off on the rules, and
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.900]   we'll talk about this later on in the class, and you're giving them more freedom, freedom
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:42.620]   to make their own decisions, and with that freedom now, your role is changing from being
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:52.060]   less and less of an enforcer of rules to more and more of an advisor on decision making.
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:57.340]   Some parents handle that shift well, other parents don't.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:01.860]   It's hard to do that, to handle that.
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.860]   So what are the stresses and temptations here?
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:15.740]   Well, one is increased expenses for necessities, major purchases, education.
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:28.020]   It's usually at this stage where the kids end up adding to the home an additional automobile,
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:31.860]   where before you only had enough where you took the whole family around, but now they
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:36.700]   want to drive their own vehicle.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:42.700]   You're making decisions about college and you're beginning to save money for further
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:48.500]   education of the kid and send them to a university, and you realize that's going to cost an awful
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:55.260]   lot of money, an arm and a leg, to do that, and this is where oftentimes couples begin
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:34:03.860]   to talk about the wife reentering the workforce more on a permanent basis, a full-time basis,
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.580]   to get the kids through college.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:13.100]   In other words, they live on his salary, but they put the kids through college on her salary.
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:18.700]   That's usually what happens.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:23.340]   So there's these increased expenses for necessities.
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:27.500]   I mean, you think it was bad when the kids were really little that you had a doctor's
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.500]   appointment.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.820]   Now, my goodness, when they go to the doctor, it really costs something.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.300]   When they go to the dentist, it really costs something.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.740]   They're bigger.
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:40.180]   They're still kids in adult bodies now, so it's going to be more expensive taking care
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.300]   of those.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:51.620]   There's glasses they have to buy for them, contact lenses.
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:56.700]   One of my boys, just the other, last year was playing football there at the college
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.820]   and broke his nose, was elbowed.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.900]   This year, my other boy, we thought he broke his nose, but he didn't.
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:10.220]   He just got an elbow in the nose, and it just bled quite a bit, and it's a good thing he
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.220]   didn't break his nose.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.980]   But those kind of things come up.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.980]   They break their leg.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.740]   They break their arm.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:25.660]   My son-in-law, I'll never forget, he played football in high school on the same team that
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:32.980]   my son played on, and during one of the games, he broke his leg.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:40.300]   And his father is a wonderful friend of ours and a graduate of the seminary here, ran down
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:46.100]   the field to see his son and was leaning over looking at it, and it was a compound fracture,
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:51.980]   so the bone had come through the skin, was leaning over looking at it, and his father
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:36:04.980]   passed out and landed right on top of him.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.780]   Jess still talks about that.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.220]   All right.
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.980]   So there's additional expenses.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:14.420]   I mean, kids are expensive, man.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.580]   The medical bills for that.
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:19.580]   When our twins were born, they were born premature.
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.620]   They were about two weeks premature.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:27.580]   So they were in the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital for one week until their
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.500]   body weight was sufficient to take them home.
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:36.420]   Well, by the end of that week, I received a bill, now this was back in 1987.
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:43.900]   One week of our twins being in the hospital was $65,000.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.100]   That was one week in 1987.
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:52.300]   I don't even hazard a guess on what that would be today.
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:58.260]   But multiply that times, I don't know, what, five or ten, and maybe you'd be pretty close
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.900]   to what the expense would be today.
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:03.580]   Well, that was more than I had paid for my house.
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:06.940]   One week in the hospital, $65,000.
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:14.540]   I had only paid $60,000 for my home, which tells you that we were living in a much more
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:19.660]   reasonable area and at a much more reasonable time.
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:20.820]   But just one week in the hospital.
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.180]   So kids can get very, very expensive.
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.540]   Well, this particular stage is no exception.
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:30.460]   So there's these increased responsibilities.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:46.380]   Then there is also these differing views about freedom, responsibility, discipline of adolescence.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:52.820]   And you run into this because your kids end up talking to the other kids that are teenagers,
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:57.660]   and they'll come home and say, "Well, their mother and daddy lets them stay out until
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:03.980]   11 o'clock, why don't you let me stay out until 11 o'clock?"
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.220]   "Well, because I'm not their parent.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.220]   I'm your parent."
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.500]   Well, that doesn't seem to suffice.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.140]   That's not a really good argument.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.140]   It goes down really well.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:20.100]   "You're treating me like a baby," and it becomes a big argument.
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:26.400]   So differing views about freedom, responsibility, what are they responsible for around the house.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:32.300]   We always had certain things that our kids had to take care of that was beyond any kind
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:37.740]   of pay or reimbursement, it was just part of family living.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:41.340]   Everybody had certain chores that they were responsible to do.
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:46.020]   You can't imagine the discussion that occurred in our household when our kids got to be teenagers
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:51.620]   and found out that there were other Christian homes where kids didn't have to do that.
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.100]   Why do we have to do it?
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.500]   For years, they did the same thing.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.540]   Now they're asking, "Why do we have to do this?"
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:03.520]   Because you can be thankful that we're your parents.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.580]   Well, they don't feel thankful.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:15.320]   So there's differing views about responsibility, differing views of the discipline of adolescence.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.720]   How do you discipline an adolescent?
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.940]   You can try paddling an adolescent and they'll look at you like, "Huh, what hit me?
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.680]   Was that a fly?"
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.640]   So it's not very effective, it doesn't work.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.160]   So you may have to resort to other means.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:34.600]   You take away their cell phone, you think the world's come to an end, or their access
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:40.560]   to the internet, or their video games.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:46.360]   You gotta find something, or their music, or their iPods, and you think that really
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.360]   speaks to them.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.320]   Now, how long does this have to be?
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.560]   You have to get their attention some way.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:59.000]   Furthermore, there's also struggles with outside activities of the kids.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.480]   And sometimes they conflict.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.720]   You can't be everywhere at once.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:09.000]   There's a performance where one kid's going to be in a particular game, a soccer game,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.840]   or another kid's going to be having a ballet presentation.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.880]   So you can't be everywhere, and so you have to divide and conquer.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:26.360]   There's also handling new responsibilities, promotion at work.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:32.200]   As you're promoted, you get more responsibilities, and there's difficulty in managing teenagers
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.720]   as well.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:42.000]   I mean, just take a teenager to the store to buy clothes, and you'll understand what
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.780]   a challenge that is.
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:51.720]   Kids that could care less what they wore all of a sudden now become extremely picky about
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.720]   what they want to wear.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.720]   "I can't wear that.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.920]   I wouldn't be caught dead in that at school," they'd say.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.080]   "Are you kidding me?
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:06.380]   That's not cool, mom."
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.200]   So just managing them.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:16.960]   Then there's frustration with work that is growing, or tension caused by disagreements
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.660]   about how to respond to adolescents.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:26.620]   Maybe a husband and a wife have a disagreement on how to deal with them.
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.740]   She says to him, "You're being too harsh.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.340]   Stop being so harsh.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.180]   You've got to speak to their hearts."
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:40.220]   And he says to them, "Listen, if we don't get their attention, they're not going to
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.180]   treat us seriously.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.300]   We've got to be able to get their attention.
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.220]   Get them to listen to us."
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.700]   So there's a disagreement on how do you deal with the adolescents and the stress and the
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.080]   struggle that's going on there.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:58.320]   Or there's a strain that's caused by rebellion or drug abuse or sexual activity.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:06.460]   This is where sometimes kids will horribly disappoint Christian parents.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:18.060]   They'll get involved with people or drug abuse or alcohol or sexual activity.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:30.180]   This is more and more displayed in the public entertainment and medium as normal for adolescents,
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:38.840]   which is causing a dramatic increase in teenage and adolescent pregnancies.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.840]   That's going on.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:45.460]   So this is how do you respond to the adolescents?
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:52.260]   And then last of all here, there's also the strain caused by rebellion or drug abuse.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.960]   Well, I love this.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:02.280]   He says, "I just don't fit in anymore with anybody at school.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.080]   My parents aren't divorced.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.920]   I haven't been abused.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.740]   And our family isn't dysfunctional.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.360]   I'm such a freak."
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:16.200]   That's the average Christian parent ends up facing that kind of thing, "I'm just such
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.200]   a freak."
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:24.640]   All right, this brings us to life cycle number five, life cycle number five, which we're
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:31.000]   going to call shrinking family or launching family, however you want to say that.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.440]   They're ages approximately 45 to 55 in this particular family.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.320]   What are some of the unique developmental things that are going on here?
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:45.600]   Well, they're refocusing more attention on their mate and less on the kids at this particular
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.200]   stage of life.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:52.760]   They're relating to their children as fledgling adults now.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.920]   And they see some childish things and childish decisions still in their kids, even though
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:05.320]   their kids maybe have now are in married, but they also see their kids as adults.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:11.600]   And so mom and dad is usually struggling with how do I relate to them now as adults and
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:15.840]   let them make decisions where before, they can remember it wasn't that many years ago,
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:19.400]   they were making all their decisions for the kids.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:26.520]   Then there's adjusting to changing family responses to them where before mom and dad
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:31.960]   could just make a decision and they'd all get together for dinner or get together for
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.760]   a holiday or an event or a birthday party.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.600]   Well now these kids have their own lives and they have their own schedules and they're
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:42.740]   going different directions and you can't just make a decision and get everybody together
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:43.740]   at the same time.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.080]   And that's hard.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:49.260]   That's hard to make that transition.
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:54.920]   So you're going to get different responses back on things that you plan.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:45:01.680]   There's also handling increased awareness of physical vulnerability, physical vulnerability.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:09.240]   You can't do some of the things that you used to be able to do.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:14.800]   You think you could.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:20.440]   You think, you feel like you did when you were 20 years of age, but your body does not
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:26.360]   respond the same way as when you were 20 years of age.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:31.600]   It doesn't respond nearly as well as when you were younger.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:38.720]   I'll never forget the realization of that came to me back a few years ago when I was
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.040]   off speaking at a family camp for this church.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:49.160]   And we were out and it was a beautiful setting, way out in the wilderness at this lake and
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:55.680]   this church had brought in all these tents and campers and they had brought in all kinds
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.680]   of food.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.680]   We had a wonderful week.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:01.600]   And they also had brought in a couple of boats to put on this lake where every year they'd
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:02.600]   always do water skiing.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:06.320]   And one of the guys brought in this super mega powered boat.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.320]   I mean, it was unbelievable.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.800]   And I'm going, oh.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.840]   And I used to love to water ski in Sollum.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.040]   I used to love to do that.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.280]   But it had been several years since I had done it.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:21.700]   So I was all excited about getting out there on the lake.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:28.600]   And so they hooked me up and I got in the back of the boat, got my skis on and got there
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:33.320]   in the water and was sitting there in the water and had the ski rope in front of me
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:37.000]   and I gave the thumbs up for him to hit that power boat.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.560]   And man, he hit that thing and those two engines were whoosh like this and just lifted me straight
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.560]   out of the water.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.240]   Just whoom, right out of the water.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:52.780]   And I thought, oh, this is so cool, for about a half a second.
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.500]   This is going to be great.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:47:01.060]   And then I heard, I heard with my ears this snap.
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:07.180]   And I'm going, hmm, I wonder what that is.
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:12.740]   And then I felt this excruciating pain in my leg.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:18.880]   And I had ripped my hamstring, just really just ripped it.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.460]   That thing lifted me out of the water and I was standing like this, ripped the hamstring.
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:26.700]   And I just went head over heels right back down into the water.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.700]   Just straight like that.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:28.880]   It must have been quite something.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.300]   I'm glad no one was filming it.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.200]   It would have made America's funniest videos.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.120]   But it just went right like that.
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:39.540]   And I rolled in the water and I was just in excruciating pain.
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:48.200]   By the time they got me back to shore, I couldn't hardly walk on my leg at all.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.480]   And the back of my leg, the whole back of my leg was all black and blue.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.440]   It was bleeding under the surface.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:56.240]   And I had really ripped that hamstring.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.240]   Now, I used to run.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.720]   I used to play sports.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.000]   I used to ski.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.480]   I never had any problems with any of that.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:09.320]   And I'm sitting, I'm going, what is wrong here?
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:14.600]   And then my wife eventually says, "John, you're getting older."
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:22.080]   No, that can't be.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:27.000]   And for the next, I don't know, it must have been five, six weeks, I could barely walk
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.400]   on that leg until that crazy thing healed.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.640]   But it just destroyed me.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:39.600]   Now, this is what, at this particular age, about 45 to 55, all of a sudden they're struggling
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:43.800]   now with their physical vulnerability.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.480]   She can't do many of the things that she used to do and he can't do many of the things he
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:51.360]   used to do.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:57.080]   So that's what's going to happen at this particular stage.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:01.800]   Now, also there's, your married children will pull away and establish their own cycles of
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.800]   life.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.240]   It's at this stage.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:10.760]   It's always a joyful time to see that happen, but also there's a certain amount of sadness
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:16.160]   because you realize your family's now beginning to dissolve and break up and go in several
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.980]   different directions and it's not the same as it used to be.
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.600]   You're learning to cope with new people entering the family.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.960]   You always look forward to a future son and daughter-in-law.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:30.360]   You always look forward to that, but you never anticipated them bringing all their in-laws
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.640]   into this, too.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.160]   That was not something that you bet on.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:39.980]   Wow, you mean all their in-laws are coming in, too, the family?
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:45.200]   So they're struggling with that, accepting new responsibilities.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:55.000]   They have now especially advisory type of responsibilities.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.520]   So all of these developmental tasks bring on a certain amount of strains and stresses,
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.520]   too.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:06.360]   For example, financial ones, this is big because most of the kids now are definitely in college
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:13.600]   and that brings a strain on the family resources, along with keeping up with house payments
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.080]   and car payments and other things that are going on.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:24.760]   There's again the outside activities of the children that are part of these stresses and
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.520]   temptations.
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:31.720]   Unfulfilled tasks, again, become a big thing.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:41.900]   Children leaving home for college or for marriage becomes part of this struggle, too.
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:49.420]   This is a time of a lot of happiness, but it's also a time of a lot of regret because
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:54.720]   couples begin to look back upon things that they wish they would have done.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:51:06.180]   I wish I would have done this with my family or that with my family.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:14.860]   And frequently you'll find that a lot of couples, there's job or career changes that occur.
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:19.640]   Because now that they've got their children reared and they're off, they're just not happy
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:20.640]   with what they're doing.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:26.060]   Well, it brought them a paycheck, but there's more to life than a paycheck, and I don't
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.300]   want to put up with the same pressures that I've put up with before.
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:33.780]   I'm willing to accept a job that pays a lot less and I'm a lot happier at, and so there's
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.140]   frequent job changes.
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:42.940]   And then there are some close relatives or friends become seriously ill during this time.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:46.140]   Some of them may even die.
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:50.700]   So you begin to find yourself going through a phase of life where you're starting to lose
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:52:02.260]   people that are really close to you and maybe suddenly die of a heart attack or maybe a
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:11.500]   car accident or somebody contracts a disease or cancer.
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:19.580]   And then as the children leave, there is also sometimes facing the guilt of parental failure.
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:24.340]   You see the way some of your kids have grown up and you're happy about it, but then you
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:28.820]   take a look at some of the other kids and you're not as happy about what happened and
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:32.940]   you wonder to yourself, "Well, is this because of the way that I brought them up?
[00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:36.820]   Is that the reason why they're dealing with life the way that they're dealing with life
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.200]   and they're struggling with things?
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.300]   Is it my fault?
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:44.780]   Could I have done something different or better?
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:51.660]   Did I disobey God in some area where my kids now are now rebellious?"
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:58.300]   We'll eventually talk about that, especially in reference to Proverbs 22.6.
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:04.260]   Then there are pressures of taking care of aging or dying parents.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:07.700]   Usually as the kids move out, the parents move in.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:12.380]   The elderly parents, that's usually what happens.
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:19.680]   Maybe a wife's father or mother passes away and so they end up taking the remaining parent
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.100]   into their home.
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:27.120]   Or the husband's, one of their parents, his parents passes away and they end up taking
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:32.080]   one of them into the home, which brings a lot of additional strain and responsibility.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:37.940]   And now where previously in your life, you really relied upon them and looked up to them,
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:44.620]   you were their child, now it's almost as if they're the children and you're the parent
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:55.100]   and you find yourself taking over for a lot of just health and daily maintenance of food.
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:54:03.460]   If the parents get senile or experience Alzheimer's disease, where the brain begins to deteriorate
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:07.700]   and they don't even remember who you are and they don't even reappreciate you anymore,
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:10.860]   but you have responsibility for their daily care.
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:15.660]   This can bring a lot of stress on a home and a lot of stress on a marriage when that kind
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:17.540]   of thing happens.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:22.640]   And usually because the husband's still working, whatever the parents, whether it's the husband's
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:28.100]   parent or whether the wife's parent, it's usually the wife that ends up being the caretaker
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:29.740]   of the parents.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:32.540]   She's the one that usually does that.
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:37.060]   And when that happens, this is not what she envisioned the last part of her life to look
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:40.060]   like, taking care of parents for the rest of them.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:41.300]   She loves them.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.660]   She's grateful for them.
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:47.060]   It may be easier for her to take care of her parents, but it's much more difficult to take
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:49.060]   care of his parents.
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:53.100]   Or if you bring parents into the home, then there's an additional strain of the fact that
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:56.200]   maybe those parents are not believers.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:01.620]   And that brings a whole new dimension in the home.
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:10.020]   Maybe they cuss or they drink or they have some kind of habit that you're not used to
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:15.180]   and they're so old, they don't want to break their habit.
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.700]   And so this becomes a difficult thing.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:25.060]   And then it's the pressure of the child who doesn't marry or stays or returns home.
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:28.620]   And a lot of this is happening now.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:37.900]   Statistics confirm the fact in European-American homes, there is a, children are waiting longer
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:47.620]   and longer to marry, well into their 30s before they get married.
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:51.920]   Some as late as the 40s in order to get married.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:56:00.700]   So what happens when a kid goes off to college, is gone, and then comes home, doesn't marry,
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.580]   decides to live at home?
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:04.580]   What do you do?
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:07.180]   You let that kid live at home?
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:12.180]   So there's a lot of decision-making that mom and dad has to go through at that particular
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:13.180]   time.
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:16.100]   And you're going to be counseling people that'll be going through those kinds of decision-making
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:20.340]   processes.
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:29.140]   Then we get to the sixth life cycle, which is the empty nest family.
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:33.420]   Somewhere between the ages of 46 and 65, there is that empty nest.
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:38.060]   And there's a lot of things that are going on developmentally here, learning to live
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:45.180]   as a couple again, just the two of you learning to be grandparents, which on the one hand
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:54.800]   is a lot of joy, but on the other hand also represents some brand new challenges.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:57:01.380]   From the grandparents' point of view, maybe you're not really fond of the way that your
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:06.660]   kids are raising your grandkids.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:13.340]   You see some dangerous things going on in how they're handling their kids.
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:17.100]   You're also preparing for retirement, not because you want to retire.
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.900]   Very few people really do if they're happy in their job.
[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:24.220]   If they're not happy in their job and they're really looking forward to getting out of it.
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:27.820]   But if they're happy in their job, very few people really want to retire, but they realize
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:32.060]   that physically they can't keep this up forever.
[00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:33.300]   They can't.
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:37.960]   They just can't do it anymore.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:41.740]   And then they learn to relate to their children as adults there, and they help and relate
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:44.460]   honorably to aging parents.
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:50.780]   They're handling aloneness as well, being alone.
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:57.500]   What do you do spending time alone?
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:03.060]   Sometimes with just the two of you, but also at this particular stage, frequently a husband
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:04.660]   or a wife will pass away.
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:08.380]   Usually it's the husband.
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:12.540]   And now the wife is spending time by herself a lot.
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:18.740]   What do you do with that as a widow, or if you're a widower?
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:21.580]   Or you're handling physical deterioration.
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:28.300]   You find yourself going to the doctor a lot more, and the doctor wanting you to come back
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:31.220]   a lot more.
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:35.940]   And they want to put you through special tests and special treatments, and all of those things
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:40.700]   require more money and more money and more money.
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:44.300]   You're learning to communicate differently than you did before.
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:49.020]   When the kids were around the home, you sort of adopted baby language.
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:52.100]   Well, the kids are gone.
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:53.620]   They're out on their own.
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:56.580]   They're creating their own babies.
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:01.540]   And now it's kind of ridiculous that you talk baby language to each other just for the kid's
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:02.540]   sake.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:06.900]   So you're learning how to communicate differently with one another.
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:16.500]   You're developing new goals and purposes also for living.
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:21.380]   Now at this particular stage also, there is a whole set of unique strains and temptations,
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:27.300]   and this is not an exhaustive list, but for example, the death of parents, that's a unique
[00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:29.420]   strain.
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:36.060]   When parents die, there's this big void that occur in life, and you realize you're not
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:37.260]   going to see this on this earth.
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:43.640]   It makes it much easier to know that if they're believers and they've committed their life
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.420]   to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, that you'll see them again in glory.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.160]   That's a great reassurance.
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:52.920]   But what if you have parents that are not or you're unsure of?
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:57.860]   You don't know whether you'll ever see them again.
[00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:59.420]   So that's a stress.
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.580]   That's a difficulty.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:08.300]   There's the death of close friends too, which puts you in contact with your own finiteness.
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.900]   Man, this is my close friend.
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:11.900]   We grew up together.
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:17.160]   We knew each other, and this person's gone.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.620]   You don't expect that.
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:25.420]   The people that you've known for a long, long time are not the people that are around anymore.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:31.260]   Unfulfilled tasks again or undone tasks.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:39.420]   Stuff that you like to have accomplished by this stage of your life but you haven't accomplished.
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:43.640]   There's dissatisfaction with the job again that tends to reign at this particular stage.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.620]   You're not happy with it.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:47.140]   You want to do something different.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:53.860]   You feel that your life can be more meaningful serving Christ in some other way.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:01:00.180]   Or you're failing health, or there's health concerns that you have.
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:06.140]   Maybe you have a chronic disease and it bothers you.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:13.100]   Or there's the death of your mate at this stage, which is probably the most traumatic
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:19.620]   of all events that can happen in your lifetime, to lose somebody that you've been so close
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:26.660]   to for so many years.
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:31.580]   And most people, when that happens, it's very difficult for them to live above that, even
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:35.140]   though their mate was a believer and they know that they'll see their mate again.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:38.820]   It's very difficult for them with the remaining days they have to live above that.
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:45.140]   The tendency is to begin to do what Ecclesiastes 7.10 warns about.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:49.540]   That is, we have a tendency to begin to live in the past in our mind.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:53.740]   And we begin to rehearse all the wonderful things of the past as if there's nothing in
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:02:00.820]   the present that can ever be wonderful again because the person that I love is gone.
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:05.100]   And when you're counseling people like this, widows and widowers, this is something that
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.780]   you need to be aware of.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:19.540]   People who spend all day long living nostalgically, living in the past.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:26.900]   My kids used to talk with me about that because when the kids were young, I used to drag them
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:32.820]   around to battlefields, Civil War battlefields.
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.220]   That's what we would do on our vacations.
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.700]   I used to love that kind of stuff.
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:40.540]   I bore my family silly with that stuff.
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:45.320]   But I'd drag them along from one battlefield to another battlefield, explain to them what
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:50.860]   happened here and who were the major parties that were going on at this particular time,
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:56.860]   how this shaped the course of history and what happened.
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:01.620]   And they'd always raise their hand and say, "Dad, when are we going to get ice cream?"
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.580]   So that's the way I'd bribe them.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:07.580]   I'd say, "Okay, we're going to go visit -- and then we're going to go get ice cream, okay?"
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:11.140]   That's the way I'd bribe them with that.
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:23.300]   But you've got -- when you're -- my kids used to accuse me of living in the past because
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:27.060]   I'd spend all those times talking about all those battles.
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:32.740]   Well that's what can happen sometimes with -- when you've lost a spouse.
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:38.780]   You can spend all of your time just living in the past and just dwelling there and so
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:44.060]   much that you become absolutely valueless in the present.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.260]   Death of a spouse.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.040]   There's financial concerns as well this age.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:52.660]   Are we going to have enough to make it through the rest of our life even if I can't function
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:55.780]   in my job anymore and bring home a paycheck?
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:56.780]   Is that possible?
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.960]   Have we saved enough?
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.340]   Maybe we haven't.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:04.060]   What if we retire and then suddenly one of us is diagnosed with some kind of life-threatening
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:11.100]   disease that's going to require years of work and therapy and hundreds of thousands of dollars
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:15.740]   that will just drain whatever little bit of retirement that we have to -- you know, all
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:20.280]   of these things are going through their mind.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.460]   These are pressures you need to know about if you're going to counsel people at this
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.740]   stage of life.
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:30.500]   They have sexual difficulties at this stage, too.
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:37.020]   That's the reason why all these drugs have been developed to help people at this particular
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:41.900]   stage of life still have sexual desires.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:43.980]   Ecclesiastes talks about that.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:44.980]   You know that?
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:45.980]   Grab your Bible just for a moment.
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:48.500]   Let's go over to Ecclesiastes.
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:52.540]   Ecclesiastes chapter 12.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:58.140]   It talks about -- it's a whole description of growing old.
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:05.060]   And here, in verse 3, it says, "In the day when the watchmen of the house tremble," all
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:10.860]   of this is just poetic Hebrew idioms for growing old.
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:14.820]   The watchmen of the house tremble, that's when your arms get weak.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:17.400]   And the mighty ones stoop, your legs get weak.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.980]   And the grinding ones stand idle because there are few.
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:23.820]   You lose your teeth, all right?
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:30.460]   You go around talking like this, all right, and you're back to baby food again.
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.580]   And those who look through the windows grow dim, your eyesight goes bad.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.940]   Verse 4, "And the doors of the street are shut at the sound of grinding -- of the grinding
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:39.940]   mill is low."
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:41.960]   Your ears start to go bad.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.820]   And one will rise at the sound of the bird.
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:50.860]   You don't sleep as deep anymore.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:54.160]   In all, the daughter's song will sing softly.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:06:01.060]   You don't hear distinctive sounds as well anymore.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.600]   Your ability to hear is not as distinctive as it used to be.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.860]   Verse 5, "Men are afraid of high places and the tears of the road."
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:11.180]   Boy, that's true.
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:15.700]   In our household, we've got a set of stairs, a pretty fairly steep set of stairs.
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:18.820]   And I remember when the kids were younger, I could hear the kids going, "Brrr," down
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.820]   the stairs.
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:20.820]   "Brrr," up the stairs.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:23.980]   And they still do that as college kids, "Brrr," down the stairs.
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.900]   And I can remember when I was young, I used to do that too.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.460]   Now when I get to the top of the stairs, I look down, I go, "Wow, that's a long ways
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.540]   down."
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:35.820]   And then the almond tree blossoms, the almond tree blossoms.
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:39.900]   If you go to Israel during the springtime when the almond trees are blossoming, there's
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:46.700]   a real pale pink blossom that appears on the trees, and these almond trees are all over
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:53.460]   the place, and it almost as if the hills turn white, almost looks like snow.
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:56.020]   Well, that's what happens.
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.060]   Your hair turns white.
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.060]   The almond tree blossoms.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:04.300]   The grasshopper drags himself along, you become a cripple.
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:10.100]   And then he says, "And the caperberry is ineffective."
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:11.740]   What is that?
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:12.740]   The caperberry is ineffective.
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:18.060]   Well, if you study this, it was believed in the ancient world that the caperberry was,
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:21.460]   in a sense, ancient Viagra.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:24.980]   It was supposed to help your sexual desire.
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:28.220]   But it doesn't even work anymore.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:31.300]   The caperberry is ineffective.
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:38.820]   For man then goes to his eternal home while mourners go around in the street.
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:43.020]   So that's what it's like, and that's very realistic.
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:48.100]   So at this particular stage, there's usually a lot of sexual difficulties.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.820]   And then there is this handling of disappointment that's caused by the children who reject your
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:56.820]   values or standards or your faith commitments.
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:59.300]   And there's several different ways that this can flesh itself out.
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:06.580]   Maybe they totally reject the Lord, and they walk away and declare themselves to be atheist.
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:13.140]   Or maybe they reject your church, and they go off and they begin attending another church,
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:20.740]   a church that you don't believe is really doctrinally sound, but they attend some other
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:21.740]   church.
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:22.740]   Who knows what the influence may be?
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:29.300]   It could be a million things, or who knows what they're thinking.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:33.820]   So how do you handle that?
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:37.300]   The disappointment that's there.
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:45.860]   How do you treat your kids when you think that they are attending a bad congregation
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:50.860]   or not very good one, at least?
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:54.140]   You'll get people come in and ask you all kinds of questions like that as a pastor.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:58.260]   "What am I supposed to do with these kids?
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:03.700]   This is not the way that I reared them."
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:09.940]   Which then brings us to our seventh life cycle.
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:12.500]   And this is in later life.
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:21.780]   Retirement, 65 years of age and up, although people are retiring older and older now, primarily
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:24.540]   because of finances, primarily because of the stock market.
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:28.900]   They've lost a lot of their retirement in the stock market.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:35.580]   So they're staying in the workforce longer.
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:41.420]   There are developmental tasks here, like adjusting to big changes in lifestyle now that they're
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:42.420]   retired.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:46.780]   They're no longer going to work on a regular basis, so there's a general slowdown in life.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:50.540]   They're adjusting to the sale of the family home and moving to a new place.
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:56.780]   What was really good as a family home, like a home with a set of stairs and bedrooms upstairs
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:58.940]   now, they can't navigate those any longer.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:03.380]   So you need something that's much smaller, something that can be cleaned much more easily.
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:08.500]   So you've got to sell the home and get into a smaller place.
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.540]   So you're adjusting to that.
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:16.980]   You're adjusting then to loss of a mate, the struggles there.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:26.200]   You're trying to figure out a satisfactory use of spare time.
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:30.940]   One of the marvelous ministries that Grace to You has is usually during the week they
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:40.680]   have retired folks come out and work on mailings, and they offer themselves for a full day working
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:44.460]   on mailings to mail things out to people that have ordered things there from Grace to You,
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.620]   and these retirees come in and do that.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:49.740]   And then Grace to You gives them a free lunch, and they just have a ball up there.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:52.540]   If you ever go up there and watch that, it's great.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.820]   Lots of fellowship with one another.
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:57.300]   They're doing something useful for the kingdom of God and having some kind of ministry.
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:02.420]   I think one of the greatest untapped resources in the church today are our retirees.
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:08.580]   I mean, you know how much work and how much wisdom you could bring to ministry by bringing
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:15.900]   them in and finding things for them to do that would be useful for the kingdom of God.
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:20.220]   But so there's a satisfactory use of leisure time and spare time.
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:24.300]   And then there's adjusting to illness and frailty.
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:28.940]   Their ability to be able to navigate things, get around, is much more limited than it was
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:33.440]   before.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:41.300]   They also are adjusting to the fact that they are in a subculture status.
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:44.060]   And you know, you can see this in a lot of churches today, especially the way the young
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:46.380]   people treat some of the elderly.
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:49.580]   Young people go running through hallways and almost run them down and act like they're
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:53.900]   not there.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:57.860]   I remember as a pastor at one particular point in our church, I had to get up on a Sunday
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:05.060]   morning and admonish parents to teach their kids how to act at church so they didn't run
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:09.420]   our senior saints down in the hallways because they'll do that.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:10.420]   They'll run them down.
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:14.500]   They'll be walking down the hallway as a cane and some kid will go zipping past them like
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:21.020]   without a thought in the world and knock somebody over.
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:25.980]   And we had it happen on a couple occasions when that occurred.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:31.380]   And the parents have got to step in there and teach their kids how to act in church.
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:35.780]   So this is part of that subculture status.
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:42.700]   Have you ever noticed that at the church where you attend, how the senior saints are treated,
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:48.540]   it's almost as if in most churches today they don't exist.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.780]   It's almost like they don't exist.
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:55.700]   Oh, they're there and occasionally there'll be an acknowledgment of them, but it's like
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:58.020]   they're not there and they know it.
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:03.620]   They know how people treat them.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:11.140]   Back in Dayton, Ohio, there is a large church there that one day the pastor got up and the
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:14.280]   emphasis of that particular church is on the youth.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:17.500]   Got up on Sunday morning, I can't believe, I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't heard
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:23.980]   it with my own ears because they have a television broadcast too, and said, "Listen, if you are
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:28.640]   over 35 years of age, you better look for another church because our church isn't for
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.020]   you."
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:33.140]   I thought to myself, "My goodness sakes."
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:40.220]   In other words, we're going to restrict our ministry to a certain age group.
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:41.220]   That's horrible.
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:42.220]   That's horrible.
[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:48.380]   You see, I think that that's exactly what's being communicated to people that are widows,
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:51.580]   widowers, retirees in the church today.
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:14:01.660]   They're basically subculture status, and yet I think they're one of the more greatest resources
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:04.260]   the church has.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:08.940]   Of all the people that have freedom and the wisdom and probably a lot of skills that a
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:13.020]   church could use, they're the ones.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:16.700]   Then there's learning new ways of contributing to the world and to the church, which follows
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:20.100]   right out of that last one.
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:26.180]   Learning new ways to contribute to the world and to the church.
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:32.740]   That may be very difficult for people to make that transition, especially at this particular
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:39.100]   stage of life, and then also accepting new roles in each other's lives.
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.100]   You become each other's caretakers.
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:52.300]   A husband and a wife become real caretakers with one another.
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.260]   We had a dear, dear couple.
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:56.900]   God has since promoted them to heaven in our church years ago.
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:58.100]   I'll never forget them.
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:02.500]   Their names were Delbert and Evelyn Lakes, dear, dear couple.
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:11.380]   One day, Evelyn called me and said, "Pastor," she says, "I have been experiencing horrible
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.860]   depression.
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:18.660]   I've never had any experience like this before in my life, and I don't know why."
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:22.700]   She says, "I've even thought that this was some kind of demonic activity that's going
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:23.700]   on."
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:27.820]   Now, when Evelyn says that, I'm starting to really take this seriously, and I'm going,
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:29.380]   "Oh, we need to sit down and talk, Evelyn.
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:34.740]   Why don't you and Delbert come in in the evening, and we'll sit down and talk about this, and
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.660]   we'll seek God's answers for these problems?"
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:44.500]   So one of the things that I did was I had Evelyn write out all the medications that
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.900]   she was taking.
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:47.460]   We had our first counseling appointment together.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.500]   I asked her a lot of questions about what was going on.
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.460]   We had a lot of prayer over it.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:57.780]   We took her to several scriptures that pointed to hope, and in the meantime, she had given
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:01.460]   me this list of all the medications that she was on, and one of them was a beta blocker
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.260]   for her heart.
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:08.260]   And so I always have a PDR, a Physician's Desk Reference, handy where I can look up
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.540]   the side effects and all the medications.
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:14.660]   And so I looked up the side effects of the medication, and I found out that at the very
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:20.020]   top of the list, the very top of the list of this particular beta blocker for her heart
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:25.660]   was severe depression, bold letters.
[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:27.620]   I'm going, "Hmm."
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:30.180]   So I'm on the phone five minutes later, and I'm calling Evelyn.
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:35.220]   I say, "Hey, Evelyn, when your doctor prescribed this particular beta blocker for your heart,
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:40.420]   did he tell you that one of the side effects is severe depression?"
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.060]   "No," she said.
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:47.740]   "Well, I think you need to call your doctor back, and I think you need to tell him that
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:53.140]   you're experiencing severe depression, and you think it's closely associated with this
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:54.380]   beta blocker."
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:17:00.180]   And sure enough, she had started experiencing her depression within the past two months,
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:05.820]   and it was about two and a half months ago that she had started on this beta blocker.
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:06.820]   She called her doctor up.
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:07.820]   The doctor said, "No problem.
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:08.820]   We can put you on something else."
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:11.580]   He put her on something else.
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:12.580]   Depression went away.
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:15.240]   Didn't have the depression anymore.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.540]   So that wasn't a spiritual issue after all.
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:20.820]   It was actually a medical issue.
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:25.740]   That she would have gone on thinking that she was experiencing some kind of demonic
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:34.340]   attack in her life or some kind of severe spiritual deficiency in her life if we hadn't
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:43.100]   found out that this was actually a medication issue that was going on in her life.
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:47.860]   And this was all new to her because she was getting older.
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:52.260]   Her heart was frail.
[01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:58.380]   And so they were trying to keep her alive as long as possible and trying to give her
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:02.780]   the medications in order to do so.
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:06.740]   But that's a dear, dear, you know, you'll have this in your pastoral life.
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:12.580]   There are people that you really look forward to seeing in heaven, you know.
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:16.820]   And Delbert and Evelyn Lakes are that couple, that kind of couple.
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:21.540]   Those kind of people that I look forward to seeing in heaven someday.
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.780]   All right.
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:32.020]   So this particular stage also brings with it certain stresses and temptations here.
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:34.340]   Like my little picture there.
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:38.060]   Grandpa and grandma giving each other a big schmooch.
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:41.300]   So well, of course, financial.
[01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:45.740]   Because neither of them are usually working at this particular stage full time.
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:50.420]   They may have a part-time job.
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:59.860]   Sometimes I jokingly say to my wife, my goal in life is to become a Walmart greeter.
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:01.540]   They may have a part-time job like that.
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.300]   Like a Walmart greeter.
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:08.020]   Somebody greets somebody at the entrance of the store.
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:11.540]   She just rolls her eyes.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:22.780]   Or there's a serious illness of one's -- there's just general declining health.
[01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:29.300]   So you realize that you spend a lot of your time just addressing health issues.
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.100]   Health issues.
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.980]   My father passed away several years ago.
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:38.660]   He was a pastor all my life, but he passed away back in 1985 of leukemia.
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:44.860]   And my mom continued to work and for a time after her retirement she stayed with my sister
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:48.740]   and her husband.
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:49.740]   And then she remarried.
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:58.060]   In fact, it's really funny, my mother remarried a guy that she knew in college.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:02.460]   They had not seen each other for 50 years.
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:08.300]   And out of the clear blue sky, he called her after his wife had died.
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:11.820]   His wife had died a year or two before.
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:15.740]   And he remembered her, something had brought her to mind, and so he tracked her down and
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:16.740]   called her.
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:20.580]   It turned out my father was gone, too, and they struck up this relationship.
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:25.660]   My mother lived in Spokane, Washington, and this guy lived in Beaver Creek, Ohio.
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:30.900]   So clear cross country, and they struck up this relationship on the phone and eventually
[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:34.180]   married and I got to do their wedding.
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:36.300]   I got to do my own mother's wedding.
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:37.300]   Isn't that great?
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.820]   How many people get to do that?
[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:44.940]   I told my mom at the beginning of the wedding ceremony, I said to her, "You know, Mom, I
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:48.180]   got to ask you to forgive me."
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:52.740]   And she looked at me really funny, said, "I wasn't able to be at your first wedding, but
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:57.700]   I wasn't going to miss this one."
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:02.140]   She just rolled her eyes, too, and we went on with the marriage ceremony.
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:07.100]   The audience seemed to like it, though.
[01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:14.260]   So anyhow, my mother remarried, and her new husband's a wonderful Christian man, really
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:19.380]   loves her, and they love each other, and they're spending their senior years together.
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:27.180]   His name is Ray, Ray Enting, and one of the things they found out about his health insurance
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:31.980]   was that it covered eye problems.
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:40.500]   And my mother, it turned out, had some pretty serious cataracts on her eyes, and she used
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:48.220]   to tell the story on how the kitchen sink there at their house, she would scrub and
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:52.700]   scrub and scrub that, you've got to know my mom in order to really appreciate this, scrub
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:22:00.940]   it, but she could never get that kitchen sink white until she had her cataracts removed,
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:03.140]   and they were white.
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:09.300]   They were always really yellow.
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:13.700]   And it seems like one thing after another, as the two of them grow older, there's one
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:19.780]   physical problem after another that occurs that's going on there like that, and this
[01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:20.780]   is this age.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:26.140]   This is, there's a general decline in health and struggles that they're going to face.
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:31.020]   There's unfulfilled tasks, too, especially because they don't have the physical ability
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:36.140]   to get everything done, and they don't have the money to pay anybody else to do it.
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:42.740]   So usually they have to rely upon family to come in and do some of those homebound tasks,
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:49.340]   and if the family can't do it, it just doesn't get done.
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:56.900]   And here's another thing, now when you add this up, there's a lot of time on their hands,
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:01.700]   and there's not a whole lot to do that's really constructive or to keep their mind occupied.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:07.340]   They can do a lot of reading, a lot of Bible reading, that kind of stuff, and that's good,
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:13.260]   but beyond that, there's not a whole lot of things that they can occupy themselves with.
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:20.300]   When you combine those two things together, there's a lot of room for remorse and guilt,
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:25.940]   and usually when you're working with someone at this particular stage, this is something
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:31.660]   that you encounter, or a couple.
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:42.580]   Maybe it's the way in which they raise their children, maybe it's over some past deed in
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:49.980]   their life, something that they neglected to do, or something that they did that they
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:56.460]   wished they had never done.
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:24:01.620]   I have a little ER clip from Emergency Room, which is a television program, and on that
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:08.420]   ER clip, it's actually a medical doctor that's dying of cancer.
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:17.400]   He's in the hospital dying of cancer, and he tells a story.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:21.220]   As he's dying of cancer, this hospital therapist comes in to try to help him because he's full
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:25.460]   of all kinds of guilt as he thinks back across his life, and one of the things that really
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:32.780]   bugs him is the fact that years before when he was a new young doctor, a young man was
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:39.660]   brought in accused of a horrendous crime of murder, and he had a choice as a young doctor
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:44.860]   on whether to do a rather complicated procedure on him in order to save the young man or not
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:49.420]   do the complicated procedure, and he chose because the man was accused of this horrendous
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:58.500]   crime to let him die, only to find out a week after the kid died that the kid was innocent.
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:04.740]   He did not do the crime that he had been accused of doing, and now this guy, this old man,
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:08.860]   this old medical doctor is dying, and this thing is still weighing on his conscience,
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:14.340]   and he has this hospital therapist, this woman who's attempting to try to help him, but everything
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:19.340]   that she tries to say doesn't help at all because she really doesn't have any real answers,
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:26.420]   and he's saying to her, "Listen, can I have forgiveness for sins?
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:29.800]   Is there any kind of atonement for sin?"
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:39.060]   And she can't give him a straight answer on that, and so it's a very dramatic time, but
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:46.140]   that's a beautiful picture of what you'll face in counseling people that are elderly,
[01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:49.420]   and there are things that have occurred or that they've done that's a part of their past
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:54.820]   that they really regret, and you can help them with that, and you can help them understand
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:58.980]   what Romans 8:1 says, "There is therefore now no condemnation of those that are in Christ
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:01.060]   Jesus," right?
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:07.300]   You can help them understand that and the forgiveness that it can have in Christ because
[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:09.140]   of the things that have occurred in the past.
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:12.100]   Let me share one other thing about that.
[01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:17.060]   I remember several years ago when I visited a home of a family that had just begun attending
[01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:22.100]   our church.
[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:28.820]   It was an older couple, and the wife had begun attending.
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:34.580]   Rarely would the husband come to church, but he did occasionally, and so I had a chance
[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:36.860]   to go visit them in their home and share the gospel.
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:41.320]   Turned out the wife was genuinely a believer, the husband was not, and I finally got down
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.460]   to brass tacks with the guy.
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:52.420]   The guy had been through World War II, and finally, when we got down and he realized
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:57.940]   that I was just trying to help him, and he was a pretty clear-thinking guy, he began
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:00.900]   to say, "But you don't understand what I've done.
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:05.980]   You don't understand what I did during the war."
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:07.500]   And I said, "Well, you know what?
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:10.180]   I don't need to know what it is.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:17.580]   It's between you and God, but I don't think that there is any kind of sin that's unforgivable,
[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:28.300]   except for a sin would be like blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, that is, attributing to the
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:35.060]   Holy Spirit things that would only be attributed to Satan."
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:39.100]   And I gave illustrations of that from Scripture, in terms of people that were murderous, that
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:40.660]   couldn't be forgiven.
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:50.800]   The Apostle Paul himself was a murderer, and I can remember the tears in his eyes, because
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.940]   he had basically lived with these crimes.
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:28:04.460]   Some of them he shared with me, and I think in the face of the struggle of war and battle,
[01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:09.180]   there's a part of me that understands why he did what he did, but it wasn't necessary
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:17.160]   what he did, in terms of taking people's lives.
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:21.940]   So I understand his guilt that he carried all of his life, but to see God forgive that
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:29.020]   guy and lift his guilt, you see, he had carried that all of his life, right into his retirement
[01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:31.900]   age.
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:34.060]   And you're going to face people like that all the time.
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:37.120]   So they're going to have a lot of remorse, a lot of guilt.
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:40.940]   And then there's going to be concerns about the future.
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:46.780]   They realize they don't have a lot of time on earth, but they wonder, one of the biggest
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:50.700]   things, probably right at the top of the list is, "Am I going to have enough resources in
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:54.220]   order to make it to the end?
[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:57.580]   Or am I going to have to rely upon my family?
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:29:04.180]   I don't want to be a stress and strain upon my family," they'll say to you.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:08.860]   Well, if that's what has to be, then it has to be.
[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:11.820]   And then if the family can't help, then the church needs to move in.
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:16.380]   1 Timothy is clear about that.
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.900]   So they're concerned about the future.
[01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:21.940]   They're concerned about losing each other.
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:28.900]   Since they've been together for so long, my grandparents celebrated 70 years of marriage.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:31.260]   70 years.
[01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:41.580]   Of course, they were married in the hills of Tennessee when she was 13 and he was 14.
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:44.460]   Don't do that anymore, huh?
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:50.920]   Some of you would be married for 15 years by now, wouldn't you?
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:30:02.780]   So, but they celebrated 70 years of marriage and I remember their anniversary party and
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:08.540]   they were both still functioning, but by 75, both of them, God had eventually taken both
[01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:11.620]   of them home.
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:16.420]   So what's their concerns about the future?
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:22.340]   And then usually, as time goes on and they don't think as well, confusion sets in and
[01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:27.400]   with confusion, right on the heels of that will come discouragement.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:34.280]   Some of you that have worked in retirement homes or senior homes before or maybe had
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:37.120]   ministries there know what I'm talking about.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:40.040]   You can go one week and the person will remember you and the next week they'll forget who you
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.040]   are.
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:49.160]   They're confused about you and they sit around and the only thing they have to think about
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:52.560]   is the kids and why aren't the kids calling us?
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:55.040]   Why aren't the kids visiting us?
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:56.920]   What kind of decisions are the kids making?
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.560]   What are they doing now?
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:04.840]   That's all they have to think about and it's good in order to pay honor and respect to
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:10.780]   father and mother to call them and to contact them and to visit them as much as possible.
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:14.040]   That's a good thing, but they can't babysit them all the time.
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:17.940]   They've got their own lives to live and they have their own responsibilities.
[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:26.680]   They can't do that and sometimes some of those expectations really become unreasonable expectations,
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:27.780]   but why is that?
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:33.940]   Because they have a lot of time on their hands and they're not sure exactly what to do with
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:36.980]   all that time.
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:43.000]   And you have the capacity as a pastor to step into that void, so to speak, and help them
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:50.960]   be creative and beneficial to the kingdom of God and even to your church for that time
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.700]   that they have on their hands.
[01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:56.700]   There's certain gifts and abilities that those people have.
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:32:03.220]   Some of them are musical, some of them are very practical in terms of there are families
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:11.100]   that are maybe poor families in your church, and the husband happens to be quite handy,
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:18.800]   plumbing, or carpentry, and you say, "You know, you can go and have a ministry over
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:26.820]   here to the Jones family and repair some things at their home," and wow, all of a sudden now
[01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:30.860]   they're really, the body of Christ is now ministering to other members of the body of
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:31.860]   Christ.
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:36.320]   And the Jones family ends up inviting Grandpa and Grandma over for dinner, and they have
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:41.860]   a great time, and their kids end up adopting Grandpa and Grandma, and Grandma ends up doing
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:47.360]   a lot of sewing projects for Mrs. Jones, and this just goes on and on and on and on.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.740]   Those kind of things happen.
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:56.740]   And that's where you've got that inter-gender thing going on in the church that I think
[01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:58.500]   is very, very beneficial.
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:04.940]   But like I said in our last class sessions, most of the time when you go into a lot of
[01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:09.580]   churches all these Sunday school classes and stuff are divided up into age groups, and
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:13.180]   very little inter-gender mixture ever takes place.
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:18.140]   And it's almost as if we take the old folks and we kind of set them off in this class
[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:25.900]   over here, and then all the other really active classes are over here, and we don't realize
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:30.500]   how much we could benefit from them just as much as they can benefit from us in terms
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:34.260]   of personal ministry.
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:37.720]   So now why do we go through all these life cycles?
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:41.180]   Because I want you to understand that when you're sitting in front of a couple, I want
[01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:47.220]   you to be thinking about what is the unique stage of life that they're at.
[01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:56.240]   What temptations, strains, stresses are unique to that particular cycle?
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:00.060]   And it will help you gather good data.
[01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:04.460]   It will help you to think through their problems.
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:08.300]   It will help you to understand why they've made some of the decisions that they've made,
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:12.780]   whether they're good decisions or bad decisions.
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:22.400]   It will really help you minister to them much more effectively.
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:32.860]   Counseling then becomes really creative and very meaningful when you are able to have
[01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:36.700]   insights into where people are at.
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:41.660]   In fact, people will say to you in counseling, "How did you know that?
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:45.460]   When you asked me about this or you asked me about that, how did you know that?"
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:51.340]   Well, you can say, "You know, I was just thinking about other people who were at your particular
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:55.180]   stage of life and all the stresses and temptations that they go through.
[01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:58.900]   I just kind of figured that this was the same thing that you'd be going through."
[01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:00.100]   Well, you know what?
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:01.420]   You're right.
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:05.460]   This is what's going on in our life right now.
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:06.460]   Help me, pastor.
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:10.620]   Do you have anything that you can say that will help me?
[01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:18.700]   Some Scripture deal with my loneliness or our financial struggles or my worry and concern
[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:22.900]   about the future or our children.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:24.780]   Some of them have walked away from the Lord.
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:27.500]   What can we do to reach out to them?
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:31.900]   Or what am I going to do with all my spare time?
[01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:33.740]   I've got loads and loads of spare time.
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:34.980]   What am I going to do with that?
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:39.460]   Is there anything that you need that would be helpful to you here around the church?
[01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:41.780]   What can I do?
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:45.100]   Well, you can help them out in this way.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:54.620]   So all these unique family cycles reveal certain things about these people because of the stage
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:36:02.000]   that they're at and the unique, or I don't want to say unique, but the particular difficulties
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.900]   that people face at that particular stage of life are unique to everyone.
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:09.380]   This just reinforces what 1 Corinthians 10:13 says.
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:15.820]   There's no temptation taking you except for what is common to man, right?
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:20.980]   You're not the first person to have gone through these stages and these temptations and difficulties.
[01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:22.720]   You're not.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:31.980]   So it reinforces that kind of thing and it helps you address their problems.
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:36.820]   Okay.
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:45.140]   Next week we're going to get back to analyzing and assessing why the family problems have
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:48.580]   developed and continued for such a long period of time.
[01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:51.320]   We'll talk about that a little bit more.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:53.500]   So everybody have a good week.
[01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:54.500]   Yes, sir.
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:37:14.900]   How would you deal with a person of the kind you were just talking about and you made a
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:15.900]   number of good suggestions to them of how they could overcome their loneliness or to
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:16.900]   feel more useful in life, but they were not open to your ideas.
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:19.900]   They just preferred to wallow in their loneliness and self-pity.
[01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:24.320]   How would you deal with that?
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.180]   The question is, how do you deal with a person who you give them a lot of suggestions and
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:33.180]   they're at this elderly stage of life in order to help them with that and they prefer to
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:39.780]   ignore the suggestions and continue to wallow in their self-pity and, well, one of the things
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:43.020]   that I like to help people with is this.
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:45.580]   You may be alone, I tell them.
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:51.460]   You may be alone, but you choose to be lonely, okay?
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:52.520]   That's your choice.
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:59.940]   In other words, your husband or your wife may be gone, but you're the one who chooses
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.580]   to be lonely and you're the one who chooses to wallow in self-pity.
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:10.580]   Now, if you want help, I'm going to give you some practical help, and that is, this is
[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:15.540]   akin to what Hebrews 10, verse 24 and 25 says, "Don't forsake the assembling of yourselves
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:19.260]   together as some are in the habit of doing."
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:24.940]   But we're put here on this earth in order to stimulate one another on to faith and good
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:28.380]   deeds and you can actively do that.
[01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:32.620]   You can be a great help to other members of the body of Christ with the gifts and abilities
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:42.920]   that God has given you, but don't complain about being lonely because that's your choice.
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:46.940]   Your circumstances may dictate that you're alone, but you choose to be lonely.
[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:50.500]   You choose to feel lonely and you choose to act lonely.
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:53.380]   So that's nothing but your choice.
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:55.360]   It's up to you to change.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:56.860]   I want them to see that.
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:39:01.980]   Does that help you, Jim?
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:07.540]   Because I want to challenge...
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:10.660]   Sometimes people will bring this stuff to you because they want you to wallow with them
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:13.420]   in their self-pity.
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:14.420]   And I'm not going to do that.
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:15.420]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:21.980]   I'm going to sympathize with them and the difficulties that they're going through because
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:22.980]   they're alone.
[01:39:22.980 --> 01:39:24.980]   But I'm not going to wallow with them in self-pity.
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:30.300]   I'm going to challenge where they're at and say, "No, God has still given you life.
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:35.900]   That means that he has a purpose for your life and you can take that and you can misuse
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:38.500]   it or you can be a good steward of it and use it."
[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:44.180]   And I've given you several suggestions on how you can be a good steward with your life
[01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:47.380]   and the breath that God's given you.
[01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:51.580]   Don't choose to be lonely, even though you're alone.
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:54.860]   Instead, choose to be beneficial to other people.
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:59.780]   Choose to love them and care for them, even though you may not know them.
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:02.780]   You can be a great benefit.
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:07.360]   And they end up having a lot of fun doing it.
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:11.820]   I mean, how many times can that be reproduced about sending grandpa and grandma over to
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:12.820]   the Joneses?
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:17.020]   I mean, eventually, grandpa starts helping the Joneses out practically and then grandma
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:20.300]   gets involved and then the Joneses have them over and then they adopt each other and they
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:24.660]   adopt them as grandpa and grandma and just one thing leads to another and, wow, this
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:26.940]   is all plus, plus, plus on all sides.
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:28.380]   It's a great thing.
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:29.380]   [end]
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:29.380]   1
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:30.380]   1
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:31.380]   2
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:32.380]   3
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:33.380]   4
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:34.380]   5
[01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:35.380]   6
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:36.380]   7
