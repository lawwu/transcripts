[00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:09.200]   If I could only do two of these seven things, I would do the first two. If I could only do three, I would do these first three, which is where today we're going to talk about family liberty.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:19.660]   Then, as we pivot, this is the last of those kind of highly ideologically. Then we're going to talk about financial spending liberty. We're talking about business liberty.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.660]   We're going to talk about freedom from state control.

[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:48.920]   I'm going to talk about financial liberty. That's where we're going in this series. But what I have experienced and the reason I'm discussing is because I want you to understand that there are benefits of these things that are under discussed. One of the reasons many people want financial independence and they're striving for that is to have more freedom in their lives. And freedom often comes down to the ability to choose whatever you want to choose with a minimum of external constraints.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.920]   I'm going to choose whatever you want to choose whatever you want to choose with a minimum of external constraints.
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:03:18.160]   And what I've found is that these decisions have helped me to have that freedom, even though I'm not yet financially independent. I want to talk to you about family liberty and the specific application of that, which is home education, homeschooling. I've spoken extensively about home education and homeschooling, and I'm not going to reprise all of those previous shows in this show. Rather, I'm going to focus on the freedom and the freedoms that you have that come from state control.

[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:18.500]   where I called on a prospective client and it was about 9:30 in the morning.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:18.500]   I was invited to their home and I'm sitting at the kitchen table and this husband and wife
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:18.500]   are just simply sitting there lingering over their coffee to meet with me and they didn't seem to have any real pressing need to brush out the door and get to work.

[00:16:48.740 --> 00:17:18.740]   But I think that moving constantly leads to a much less strong local physical community of people.

One of the major complaints. I have institutionalized schooling is that what they teach is irrelevant., largely irrelevant.

[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:19.380]   There's a meme that goes around and shows a picture of a parallelogram and then it talks about sure glad I know what a parallelogram is because during the season the parallel during parallelogram season I might enter my knowledge really becomes useful. The play of course is tax season. They didn't teach me about taxes in high school, but they taught me about parallelograms, but I don't care about parallelograms.

You're here listening to me right now because you value what I'm teaching you. Nobody forced you to do this. You went and looked for the information and thus you're receiving it. So this is part of your learning. And so the basic skill that children need is to learn how to teach themselves and that should happen by middle elementary school. And basically from then on a parent should be more of a
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:21.620]   coach.
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:51.120]   More of an advisor than specifically a teacher. And then of course the other obvious solution is that when a teacher is needed you go out and find the best teacher for your child. Now that teacher might be to go and take a class at a local school. If your child is studying chemistry and you don't have the financial ability to provide a fully equipped chemistry lab and you believe that my child will learn chemistry more effectively I'm going to give you a little bit of a quick summary of what I'm going to give you.
