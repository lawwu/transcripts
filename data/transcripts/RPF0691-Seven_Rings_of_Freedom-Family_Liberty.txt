[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.140]   My name is Joshua, I am your host,
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.780]   and today we continue our Seven Rings of Freedom series,
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.140]   Seven Rings of Liberty,
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.200]   wherein I discuss with you some ideas
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.440]   that I believe that if you implement them,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.480]   will dramatically enhance your personal freedom.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.420]   I have implemented all of these,
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.620]   and I have experienced the benefits
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.700]   in terms of living a very free lifestyle.
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.960]   And I don't know of anybody who lives
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.260]   a more free lifestyle than I do,
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.900]   and that's something I'm very grateful for.
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.600]   And I'm gonna share with you those ideas.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.840]   Now, thus far, even though this is a financial show,
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.740]   a lot of what I've talked about has been somewhat financial.
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.300]   We've talked about spiritual liberty,
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.080]   I made the arguments that if you're addicted to something,
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.840]   or you're in bondage, if you're just enslaved
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.580]   in a sinful lifestyle, something that's got you,
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.900]   you can't be free, no matter how rich you are,
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.540]   you just can't be free, and so that was step one.
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.720]   Then I talked about spousal liberty,
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.580]   the value of having a stay-at-home wife,
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.540]   and how, although you can analyze the finances of it,
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.760]   it comes with major freedom benefits.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.780]   And I've ordered this series,
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.280]   not in order of necessarily your order,
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.860]   but in the order that I think I would do these things.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.080]   Now, I have to admit that a lot of this
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.160]   is ideologically driven, but these are the things
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.980]   that I would do.
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.360]   If I could only do one of these seven things,
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.360]   I would do the first one.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.960]   If I could only do two of these seven things,
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.000]   I would do the first two.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.760]   If I could only do three, I would do these first three,
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.480]   which is where today we're gonna talk about family liberty.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.720]   Then, as we pivot, this is the last
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.800]   that's kinda highly ideologically,
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.720]   then we're gonna talk about financial spending liberty,
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.320]   we're gonna talk about business liberty,
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.600]   we're gonna talk about freedom from state control,
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.700]   freedom from government,
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.300]   and then we're gonna talk about financial liberty.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.860]   That's where we're going in this series.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.860]   But what I have experienced,
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.460]   and the reason I'm discussing this,
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.620]   'cause I want you to understand
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.500]   that there are benefits of these things
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500]   that are under-discussed.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.940]   One of the reasons many people want financial independence,
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.540]   and they're striving for that,
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.420]   is to have more freedom in their lives.
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.100]   And freedom often comes down to the ability to choose
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.380]   whatever you want to choose
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.020]   with a minimum of external constraints.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.260]   And what I've found is that these decisions
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.840]   have helped me to have that freedom,
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.080]   even though I'm not yet financially independent.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.640]   So I wanna talk to you about family liberty,
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.460]   and the specific application of that,
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.800]   which is home education, homeschooling.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.780]   I've spoken extensively about home education, homeschooling,
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.560]   and I'm not going to reprise
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.660]   all of those previous shows in this show.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.580]   Rather, I'm gonna focus on the freedom,
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.680]   and the freedoms that you have
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.380]   that come from homeschooling.
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.920]   I think that's under-discussed.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.940]   But I've come to really appreciate those freedoms
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.820]   as we have engaged in the home education process
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.060]   with our children.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.580]   I do need to begin with a disclaimer
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.660]   that should be obvious, but I have found is not.
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.820]   You should do what's right for you and your family.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.260]   I don't know you.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.540]   I don't know any of your situation.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.820]   And you have to do what's right for you and your family,
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.820]   regardless of what someone else says.
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.060]   My only goal is to share things that I have learned,
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.040]   share ideas that I believe are valid,
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.080]   but all ideas have to be filtered
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.820]   through your own personal situation.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.400]   There are situations in which,
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.020]   as much of a proponent of home education as I am,
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.760]   there are situations that I could go through
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.080]   that if I looked at my family
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.120]   and I saw certain things happening,
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.480]   I would enroll my children in a school,
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.520]   whether it's a private school, a government school.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.180]   Different situations call for different measures.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.060]   So I'm just gonna share with you
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.360]   what I think is the best,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.880]   or perhaps the ultimate, some of the benefits of that,
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.040]   and then you'll have to figure out
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.240]   how to apply those in your situation.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.420]   So hopefully you can stick with me
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.420]   without being offended by the strength of my own ideas.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.480]   Let's talk about freedom.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.480]   First, I consider the evidence, the case,
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.200]   very, very clear that home education
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.320]   is a superior educational modality.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.560]   On almost every metric,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.120]   homeschooled children outperform those
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.160]   who are enrolled in other institutional schools.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.040]   On almost every academic metric,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.640]   on just many, many metrics.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.000]   So that to me seems objectively proven.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And the big downside potentially of home education
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.760]   is the time that's required from a father and a mother.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.840]   That's one of the areas
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.720]   where if you make a case for freedom,
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.600]   then you say, "Is it really free
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.160]   "if I've gotta do school for my children?"
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.200]   It does take more time to work with your children,
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.080]   to teach your children, especially in the younger years,
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.080]   than it does to take them to the bus stop
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.840]   and drop them off on the bus
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.320]   to go off to an institutional school.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.600]   Certainly, it takes more time.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.760]   And so for that metric,
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.040]   if we're measuring our lifestyle based on freedom,
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.820]   I think you gotta consider,
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.760]   there's a cost to that.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.800]   There's also a cost to that,
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.240]   that you're going to need somebody
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.720]   to be involved in the homeschool.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.080]   Usually that is usually a mother,
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.080]   but it might be a mother, might be a father.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.400]   You might need a grandmother.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.080]   I was homeschooled by my grandmother for several years
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.760]   during my elementary school years.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.400]   Might be a family friend, might be a neighbor,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.800]   might be a community member, et cetera,
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.720]   but you're gonna need somebody.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.360]   But I've experienced that as long,
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.780]   if you care about those things ideologically,
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.320]   so for example, for us, that's a small burden
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.780]   because we really want that child involvement.
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.440]   We want to be together with our children.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.880]   We want to build that strong family culture.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.240]   We want the very best that we can achieve for our children,
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.840]   as do all parents.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.960]   But I've come to realize
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.200]   that there are some freedoms that I enjoy
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.880]   because of that decision.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   And I'm gonna talk through some of these freedoms for me
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.460]   and then also freedoms for our children.
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.960]   Because as parents,
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.120]   one of the things that you often want for your children
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.600]   is you want your children to avoid some of the mistakes.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.720]   If you as a parent got yourself deeply in debt
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.920]   and you made a bunch of dumb financial decisions,
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.300]   you want to help your children avoid that
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.280]   because you want them to do better than you did.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.680]   So let me share with you some ways that I've learned
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.420]   that choosing to homeschool has enhanced my freedom.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.040]   The first freedom is freedom of time.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.800]   And that's both for me and for the children,
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.880]   but primarily for the children.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.880]   I am so grateful that my children have a free schedule,
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.520]   that they don't have massive amounts of their time
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.320]   taken up in relatively worthless activities.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.520]   Just something as simple as a daily commute.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.520]   When I was growing up,
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.260]   I often rode the bus when I was in school.
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.100]   In my high school years,
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.760]   I rode the bus for 45 minutes a day.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.760]   Add that up, 45 minutes on the way there,
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.960]   45 minutes on the way back,
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.760]   pretty soon you're talking about real time.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.560]   And yet that's not an abnormal commute for many people.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.520]   Many parents get up,
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.320]   take their children 20, 30 minutes across town.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.440]   Now you can put that time and redeem that time
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.520]   by enjoying good conversation with your children, et cetera.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.720]   But it's really nice just to have a freedom of time.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.220]   One of my major complaints about institutionalized schooling
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.360]   is that most of a child's time in institutional school
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.600]   is wasted because of the need to try to get
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.160]   a bunch of diverse people to move together.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.000]   Whereas the average homeschool student
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.080]   can complete in two to three hours
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.480]   what might take an institutionalized school student
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.680]   six, eight hours to do.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.480]   There's just no need to spend that much time on academics.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.840]   You can get great academic results
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.000]   in two to three to four hours a day.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.640]   And so that frees up a child's time.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.960]   And when a child is young,
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.000]   one of the most important things that they have is time.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.040]   And the way that they invest that time
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.240]   will make a dramatic difference in the outcome
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.280]   that they get of their education,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.960]   of their childhood, et cetera.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.520]   And so in an institutionalized schooling environment,
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.320]   much of the time is wasted.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.580]   The learning time is not very efficiently used
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.560]   because the need for a child to go at the same pace
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.520]   as a bunch of other students
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.080]   instead of the ability to excel at their own pace
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.400]   or to go slowly at their own pace.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.540]   And then much of the play is not so fun,
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.360]   where it's just stuck into arbitrary schedules
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.320]   and yeah, you got 45 minutes here to play.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.080]   And so instead of a child being able to gain the benefit
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.580]   of hours of uninterrupted self-directed play,
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.280]   then they just have this highly structured directed play,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.800]   which doesn't have the same benefits
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.240]   as unstructured undirected play.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.240]   So I really treasure seeing my children have time
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.500]   to enjoy their pursuits.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.760]   And it's only gonna get better from here.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.840]   My children are still very young.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.000]   My eldest is six.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.600]   It's just gonna get better from here.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.480]   And when you talk about freedoms,
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.920]   especially the freedoms that you and I really enjoy,
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.000]   it's really nice to have,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.680]   what do you want when from financial independence?
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.200]   Many people want control over their day, freedom of time.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.400]   Well, don't you want that for your children?
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.900]   I think many people really do.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.200]   They want that for their children.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.560]   Now, the opposite side is it's really nice
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.720]   to have freedom of time for the parents.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.960]   One of the things that we find,
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.560]   and I try to run my day in a fairly scheduled way,
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.340]   I think that leads to a more efficient,
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.720]   smoother functioning household.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.440]   So we have a family schedule.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.440]   But the nice thing about a schedule is
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.240]   there's no outside dictates on that family schedule.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.440]   So if you get up a little bit later,
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.940]   or you go to bed a little bit earlier or later,
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.160]   or something changes, you're not stuck on a rigid
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.640]   chronological hour time schedule
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.920]   imposed on you from without.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.480]   Just yesterday, I made a big breakfast for my family,
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.320]   and we're just enjoying, I was sitting at the table,
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.760]   just kind of lingering over the table,
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.240]   and I was talking with my wife
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.480]   about how much I appreciate the ability to do that.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.360]   Now, one of the things that gives me the ability to do that
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.380]   is, of course, entrepreneurship,
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.620]   which we'll talk about in a later show,
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.480]   leading to additional freedom.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.680]   But I'm grateful that my wife and my children can do that,
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.600]   even if I can't.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.680]   I had an experience when I was a financial advisor
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.600]   where I called on a prospective client,
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.720]   and it was about 9.30 in the morning.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.080]   I was invited to their home,
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.400]   and I'm sitting there at the kitchen table,
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.920]   and this husband and wife are just simply sitting there,
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.800]   lingering over their coffee to meet with me.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.080]   And they didn't seem to have any real pressing need
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.880]   to rush out the door and get to work.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.480]   We were just having a leisurely conversation.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.720]   As I recall, they didn't have much money,
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.880]   but it just was such a clear picture to me
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.680]   of what I didn't necessarily have at that time.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.520]   Because I worked a lot,
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.160]   I'd get to the office at seven o'clock
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.880]   and start my day usually by seven o'clock.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.160]   And I thought to myself, I want this.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.800]   I want the ability to sit and linger over a cup of coffee
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.640]   if I choose to, to sit and enjoy a sunny morning
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.280]   without having to rush off and worry about it.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.200]   And I appreciate the fact that my family,
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.600]   even if I didn't have that ability,
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.920]   my family has that ability,
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.720]   the ability to linger over breakfast.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.120]   Perhaps there's an important conversation going along
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.600]   between parents and children.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.720]   You can just linger.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.200]   Perhaps somebody wasn't feeling well.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.720]   My wife wasn't feeling well yesterday.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.880]   And so we just adjusted the whole schedule
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.560]   and she was able just to comfortably stay in bed
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.480]   some of the day and recover from her sickness.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.080]   And so the freedom over time is really, really compelling.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.260]   And when you get away
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.240]   from all of those institutional constraints,
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.640]   it completely opens up your time schedule,
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.880]   which leads to a really high quality of life.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.000]   Related to freedom of time,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.440]   the next freedom that I really appreciate
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.800]   is just the freedom of family scheduling.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.700]   If you're not enrolled in a large institution
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.680]   where you have to go along
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.840]   with everything that's institutionalized,
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.440]   you gain total freedom over your family schedule.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.400]   Caveat, of course,
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.760]   that you have to work this into how you create an income.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.440]   But most people who are locked into an institutional schedule
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.840]   tend to have, in my opinion, fairly inefficient lives.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.560]   They have to do everything
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.640]   when everybody else has to do everything.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.320]   If you go to the store on Tuesday at 10.30 in the morning,
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.160]   it's pretty quiet.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.080]   You don't have to fight traffic on the way there.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.920]   But if you go to the store at 5.30 in the evening,
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.800]   it's usually pretty full
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.400]   because everyone's on the same workweek schedule.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.520]   If you're gonna go on vacation,
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.160]   well, most people have to schedule their family vacations
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.480]   around school activities,
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.360]   which means that the parks are full, the hotels are full.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.000]   If you're in a tourist attraction place,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.020]   you can't schedule things
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.800]   when they're financially inefficient.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.960]   You can't go and take the cruise on the off season
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.760]   'cause the kid's gotta be in school.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.600]   One of the things I really treasure
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.840]   about our current family schedule
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.920]   is the fact that we don't have any day-to-day commitments.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.480]   And so we can simply come and go
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.840]   as we believe is best for our family
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.060]   without the need to relate to other people
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.060]   who aren't in our family.
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.420]   So for us, this comes in really handy
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.180]   with just things like traveling.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.460]   We travel quite a bit.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.540]   And when we travel,
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.280]   I don't have to worry about consulting my wife's work schedule.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.720]   I don't have to worry about consulting
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.200]   my children's school schedule
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.960]   and seeing when is the holiday break, et cetera.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.520]   We just do it.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.920]   And the way that we handle our schooling days
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.840]   is what we've chosen to do thus far
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.300]   is just to do schoolwork year-round.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.480]   I don't know that we'll always continue that.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.480]   There's arguments against that,
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.960]   to take a summer break, things like that.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.240]   But at the moment, we just do school year-round
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.980]   unless we've decided to not do school.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.800]   So if we're gonna go travel for a week,
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.600]   then we just don't do school for that week.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.440]   And then when we get back,
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.680]   we pick up the same schedule right away.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.460]   I think this has better educational outcomes.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.000]   I think it's better because the students stay current
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.160]   on what they're working on
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.040]   instead of having this weird four-month, five-month break,
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.540]   four-month, whatever it is,
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.220]   where they forget some of the concepts they're doing.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.100]   They're always relatively current.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.600]   I think that if you increase the number of days of schooling
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.920]   from the standard 180 days up to a higher number of days,
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.600]   you get a tremendous compound effect.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.720]   Just run the numbers on if you're learning every day
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.440]   and you go from 180 days per year to 230 days per year,
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.720]   you get a big compound effect
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   over the course of an academic career.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.200]   But beyond that, it's just really nice for a family schedule.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.680]   There's no need to worry about other people's schedules.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.880]   That means that you can come and go
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.700]   and you can get tremendous efficiency with your spending,
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.380]   which really helps on the budgets.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.360]   You can say, all right, we wanna go to this place.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.240]   Well, let's see when the tickets are cheap.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.680]   And you can buy a weird scheduling ticket combination
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.440]   that saves you hundreds or thousands of dollars
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.040]   just simply because you have the flexibility
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.880]   to fly on those days.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.880]   It is awesome to be in that situation.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.580]   And yet most people don't have that freedom.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.640]   But you can have that freedom with home education
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.600]   because you don't have to report to anybody
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.200]   about your family schedule.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.140]   You can also then adjust your family schedule
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.160]   to what works for you and your family.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.380]   Some people, it works for them
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.120]   to do schoolwork in the morning.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.280]   That was what I grew up doing.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.360]   We did school from eight o'clock to 12 o'clock,
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.180]   and that was it.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.020]   No homework, no anything.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.880]   We just did school, eight to 12.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.880]   We've kind of done that with our children right now,
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.760]   is they start first thing in the morning
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.680]   and then get schoolwork usually done 11, 12 o'clock, done.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.560]   And then the other time can be invested
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.880]   into personal hobbies, other things,
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.520]   building creative play, reading, et cetera,
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.780]   that's not just this structured time.
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.760]   But you can flip that if it works for your family.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.160]   So if I work a strange shift,
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.000]   let's say that I had a job where I worked a night shift
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.600]   and we needed to change the school day,
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.080]   you can do school in the afternoon
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.360]   or the evening and you have the total freedom
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.240]   to work the whole family schedule
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.220]   around what's best for the family.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.480]   That's really, really nice, really, really nice.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.720]   And I really treasure that freedom
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.400]   that comes from home education.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.360]   Another freedom that I really treasure
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.200]   about home education is the freedom of geographic movement.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.320]   Now, there is potentially a downside
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.720]   to freedom of geographic movement.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.760]   One downside, of course, can be the difficulty
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.320]   of maintaining local community.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.520]   There are many people who move a lot
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.840]   who develop community in other ways,
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.320]   but I think that moving constantly leads
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:57.200]   to a much less strong local physical community of people.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.520]   But with that caveat, if you homeschool
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.120]   and if you also have a location-independent income,
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.180]   again, not next show, but later show in the series,
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.720]   if you homeschool, then you have total freedom
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.120]   of geographic movement because you can do schooling
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.560]   anywhere in the world.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.040]   So literally, the entire world is open to you.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.160]   We've done a tremendous amount of traveling
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.200]   over the last couple years as a family.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.360]   We've been in, I don't know, 25,
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.200]   probably 20.5 different US states
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.820]   and half a dozen different countries.
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.000]   And in that geographic movement,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.520]   we've been able to maintain a consistent family schedule.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.760]   Our children have been able to learn,
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.880]   been able to study, been able to do academic work
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.800]   without a lot of interruption.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.080]   Travel days, there's interruption.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.080]   If you have days, you have activities, et cetera,
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.080]   there's interruption.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.520]   But you can do the same thing anywhere in the world.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.360]   From a financial perspective, this is really powerful.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.880]   One obvious kind of low-hanging fruit
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.600]   is it allows you to completely ignore
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.320]   one of the major things that parents look for
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.100]   in their housing choices, which is living
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.360]   in a so-called good school district.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.360]   The letter rating that your school district receives,
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.880]   which nobody has any idea what a good school district
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.760]   actually means, but that letter rating
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.980]   has a big impact on housing prices.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.720]   Or perhaps the need to live within
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.300]   a geographically close area, a doable commute
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.360]   to a certain private school that you wanna be involved in.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.880]   Those things make a big difference
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.680]   in terms of your housing costs
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.120]   and the type of neighborhood that you live in,
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.260]   which drives all of the other expenses.
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.720]   If you can homeschool, you have the ability
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.600]   to completely ignore those things.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.920]   You can buy a house in a bad school district
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.680]   and you don't care because you're not using
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.360]   that school district's services.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.200]   Be careful on that.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.420]   Sometimes that may not be so good
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.920]   in terms of the house price resale value,
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.200]   but it's worth it to consider that.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.360]   If you wanna live out in the country
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.760]   or live in a remote place or live in some little country
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.720]   in the middle of nowhere, you can do that
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.880]   and still get a world-class education.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.360]   You can do that without an internet connection,
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.960]   but when you can bring in an internet connection
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.840]   and you have that total geographic freedom of movement,
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.800]   it's really, really powerful.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.240]   The freedom of geographic movement opens up
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.240]   a huge, huge potential for cost savings.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.180]   You can live in a place with low housing prices.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.020]   You can live in a place with inexpensive goods and services.
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.920]   You can live in a place that's very efficient
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.280]   for your personal tax planning
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.240]   and dramatically reduce your taxes.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.700]   You can live in a place, in your choice of a place to live,
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.720]   you can live in a place that you love far more
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.160]   that has all these lifestyle benefits
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.880]   and comes as being a lot cheaper.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.920]   And home education is one of the ways that you do that.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.840]   One of the things that I have been grateful to see
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.800]   as a proponent and advocate for home education
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   is that when I study the stories of people
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.960]   who wanna do interesting family travel,
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.720]   I always loved the podcast, Family Adventure podcast,
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.360]   Eric Hemingway, when he was doing that show,
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.760]   and they would interview all these people.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.740]   And basically, all of them, they were traveling as families,
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.100]   all of them chose to do home education.
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.580]   And the reason is just simply because you can't travel
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.740]   and not do some form of home education.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.060]   Perhaps you can enroll your children in online school.
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.860]   Lots of school districts are doing that,
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.380]   which by the way is low-hanging fruit.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.820]   If you want to go through
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.420]   the standard government school curriculum,
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.440]   the standard government school grades, et cetera,
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.840]   you want a fairly standardized process, you want teachers,
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.820]   just look to see if your local government school district
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.420]   offers an online version where they can go through
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.180]   and submit their work online.
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.900]   Many people all over the world are using that
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.960]   so they can go and travel the world with their children,
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.720]   do world schooling, go live on a sailboat, live in an RV,
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.280]   move to a foreign country.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.340]   That freedom of geographic movement is incredible.
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.040]   And I think that when you have that,
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.480]   you can use that even as part
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.120]   of your overall educational plan.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.200]   One of the popular terms that I really like
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.720]   is world schooling, basically using the world as a textbook.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.040]   I think that's fantastic if you have the ability
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.040]   or the vision to create something like that.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.120]   You can really help a child
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.060]   to have a dramatically different view of education
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:15.060]   based upon using the world as an educational opportunity.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.640]   And you can do that in your local town,
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.900]   just simply going and enjoying the history
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.380]   of your local town.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.640]   You can do that in your state, in your country,
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.560]   all across the world, tremendous.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.840]   That freedom of geographic movement is amazing.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.740]   I love it, I love it so much.
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.320]   And it leads to so much fun that you can have,
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.700]   especially if you're a travel hacker
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.700]   or you're good at finding travel deals,
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.760]   the ability to not have to try to fit into
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.620]   someone else's school schedule,
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.720]   which in many ways is built on an antiquated agrarian model,
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.140]   is really, really nice.
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.860]   And it allows you to expose your children
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.660]   to much richer experiences,
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.180]   to much more meaningful points of their education.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.860]   The next freedom that I really appreciate
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.260]   that comes with home education
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.260]   is the freedom of association for you
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.800]   and for your children.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.260]   I consider freedom of association
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.720]   to be one of the most fundamental freedoms.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.380]   The ability to associate with people
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.700]   that you want to associate with on a voluntary basis,
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.260]   not to be forced into association with people
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.760]   who you don't like, or people who are rude to you,
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.780]   people who are unkind to you,
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:27.780]   people who just treat you poorly.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.740]   That's a basic human right,
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.380]   the freedom of association for you and for your children,
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.140]   especially important for your children.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.860]   One of the biggest costs of institutionalized schooling
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.160]   is that your children lose their freedom of association.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.580]   They are stuck into an institution
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.980]   with students that you didn't choose,
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.180]   that they didn't choose,
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.380]   and they're forced to associate with that.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:54.500]   And that leads to tremendous negative consequences.
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.580]   It leads to being forced to be in a situation
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:01.580]   of a very strange, non-normal environment,
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.940]   which leads to these weird behavioral things,
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.340]   weird cliques, weird groupings,
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.540]   the popular cool kids, the not cool kids.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.300]   These things just inflict this tremendous trauma
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.300]   onto children.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.440]   It leads to a child being bullied constantly,
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.100]   whether that's in a hard form with physical violence,
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.500]   whether it's in a soft form.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.500]   That bullying inflicts incredible trauma on a child,
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.640]   and the child can't disassociate.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.480]   What do they do?
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.460]   If they fight back, they get in trouble for that.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.580]   They try, but they can't leave.
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.660]   You can't let 'em leave.
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.480]   What are you gonna do?
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.180]   You can't un-enroll your child and enroll 'em somewhere else.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.500]   It's a big move.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.700]   Freedom of association is tremendous.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.560]   The ability for your children to get away from bullies,
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.180]   to get away from nasty people,
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:45.020]   to get away from people who are a bad influence on them,
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.580]   to get away from losers,
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.220]   all of those things will bring down your children
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.700]   and also you.
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.980]   As an adult, one of the most powerful freedoms
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.140]   that you have to exercise for success
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:59.120]   is to not associate with people of low moral standing,
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.280]   not associate with people that have low goals,
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.480]   that are not achievers,
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.760]   to not associate with people
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.720]   who are basically going to bring you down,
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.640]   but to associate with high performers,
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.480]   to associate with people who treat you well.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.380]   And that makes a tremendous impact
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.680]   on your personal psychology,
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.800]   a tremendous impact on the quality of life that you live,
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.040]   and you want the same thing for your children.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.780]   And so when you have total freedom of association,
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.160]   then you can pick and choose the people
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.360]   that your children are associated with.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.200]   You can make sure that their friends
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.420]   are from the highest caliber of local people.
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.400]   You can make sure that their teachers
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.680]   are of the highest caliber.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.040]   Not some random person that you didn't choose,
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.320]   but you can choose the best teacher in the world
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.800]   for this particular thing that my child is interested in
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.200]   is this person here.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.360]   So I'm gonna set up a relationship
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.280]   for this person to teach my child.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.280]   It's tremendously powerful.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.580]   And I think that when a child is surrounded
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:59.460]   by positive environments and by positive peer pressure
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.360]   and a very high-performing group of acquaintances and peers,
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.900]   they're gonna gain from that.
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.400]   Now, you can do that, obviously,
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.020]   with choosing one school versus another.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.020]   There are some schools that are known for that.
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.800]   There are some schools that are not known for that.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.140]   But perhaps the ultimate freedom of association
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.700]   is when you're not part of the institutions
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.820]   and you can pick and choose based upon the best of the best
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.080]   in every class of person that you and your children
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.740]   are going to associate with.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.120]   Tremendous benefit of freedom.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.540]   Next freedom that I really appreciate
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.020]   is just the freedom of academic excellence.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.780]   It is really nice when you're learning something
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.320]   for your children, for them to be able to advance
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.660]   at their own pace, whether that's fast or slow.
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.540]   One of the problems of trying to group together
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.660]   lots of children is to figure out how do you group
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.940]   and get a lot of children to move forward
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.340]   at a consistent time, on a consistent timeline?
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.820]   Because everybody learns at a different pace.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.760]   Some people learn very fast, some people learn very slow.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.180]   Now, obviously, that can change with some programs
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.060]   have the gifted program or whatever they call
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.860]   the stupid program, you know, where you put the kids
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.040]   who have a high cognitive ability and excel in academics,
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.400]   they move them over to the gifted program,
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.780]   they can move a little faster.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.820]   And the students who don't go in the other classes,
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.840]   but even some of those programs are being phased out, right?
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.180]   It's discriminatory to have those programs.
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.060]   And so some school districts are completely
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.740]   phasing those out.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.580]   I think New York City recently made that announcement
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.380]   in the New York City School District
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.060]   a couple of months, a month or two ago.
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:36.060]   But regardless, for any person, what you want
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.660]   is you want the ability to proceed
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.940]   at your personal learning pace.
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.900]   And so if you're a fast learner,
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.180]   or if you have a fast learner as a student,
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.980]   what you wanna do as an excellent parent
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.700]   or as an excellent teacher is you want your learner
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.880]   to go as fast as they're capable of.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.700]   There's no reason to stick to these arbitrary things
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.180]   about what first grade, second grade,
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.740]   third grade, fourth grade means.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.840]   You want them to learn as fast as they're capable of.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.900]   You wanna always challenge your student.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.140]   And so if you have a student of high cognitive ability,
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.340]   high IQ, does well in academics,
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.480]   does well with that kind of learning style,
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.820]   then you wanna push them and keep them challenged
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.420]   and let them go at their own pace
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.820]   so they can enjoy and constantly stay challenged
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.100]   and not be bored.
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.540]   On the other hand, if you have a student
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.580]   who doesn't do well with a certain subject
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.500]   or a certain style of learning,
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.960]   they don't do well with academics,
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.500]   their skills lie in some other area,
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.440]   you still want to challenge them,
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.420]   but you don't want them to feel like they're falling behind.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.180]   Both of these are destructive to a child's psychology.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.460]   Boredom is not good.
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.180]   You want a child to stay engaged.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.700]   On the other hand, a child constantly feeling overwhelmed
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.300]   can cause, really hurt their self-confidence,
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.220]   hurt their ability to press forward
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:50.900]   and harm their personal confidence.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.820]   Many children that don't do well in school
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.460]   because their skills lie in some other area,
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.460]   they don't excel with their cognitive ability
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.700]   versus other skills,
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.060]   those children wind up with these lifelong
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.580]   inferiority complexes because they didn't work well
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.420]   in that system.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.460]   And as a parent, you don't want that for your child.
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.980]   You want your child to figure out where they really thrive
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.820]   and you want to help them to thrive in that environment.
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.180]   Well, you have the freedom in home education
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.940]   to build that kind of environment,
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.380]   freedom of academic excellence.
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.020]   Next freedom that I really appreciate
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.200]   is just gonna be the freedom to have and develop
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.460]   and maintain a non-threatening environment for children.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.160]   I'm convinced that one of the worst things
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.880]   that happens to many children
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.940]   is they're raised in threatening environments.
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:40.220]   Now, obviously, that can happen outside of a school context
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.740]   and it can happen inside of a school context.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.340]   Many children are raised in households
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.860]   where their parents don't love them,
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.780]   they don't care for them,
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.820]   their parents allow dangerous and threatening influences
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.700]   in them, the parents themselves threaten their children
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.100]   and abuse their children.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.820]   And that creates a lifelong trauma
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.820]   that follows the child for many years
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.340]   until it ultimately becomes, unless it is healed.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.300]   And so obviously, that's kind of a standard thing
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.660]   that we wanna get rid of.
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.100]   But beyond that, I'm convinced
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.460]   one of the most traumatic environments
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.620]   that we put children into is school environments.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.900]   I can remember distinctly when I first entered
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.540]   into an institutionalized school environment,
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.060]   how I, for the first time in my life,
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.780]   learned that there were people who didn't like me.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.820]   I had never understood what it was like
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.660]   when I was homeschooled.
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.020]   I had never understood what it was like
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.620]   for someone to not like you
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.060]   because I thought everybody liked me.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.660]   And if anybody didn't like me,
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.860]   then of course, they didn't show that to me.
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.500]   Then all of a sudden, I started to find out
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.060]   that there were social hierarchies,
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.380]   that there's a pecking order,
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.420]   there's popularity contests.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.660]   And then I found out that there's these cues
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.660]   that are part of society,
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.460]   that you have to express these certain cues, et cetera,
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.380]   to be part of the cool kid.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.620]   And they're so stupid, right?
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.860]   The middle school cues and the high school cues.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.100]   It's so stupid.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.180]   I frequently felt like you go through
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.740]   this weird transition as a child
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.940]   where in the early years, most of the time,
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.900]   even elementary school was relatively safe,
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.940]   relatively peaceful, to a certain degree.
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.180]   And then towards the latter end of elementary school,
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.340]   it becomes strangely different.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.940]   And then it becomes really threatening
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.060]   and middle school is a really terrible environment.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.140]   High school might be a little bit better for some people.
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.700]   And then college, you start to recognize,
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.140]   oh, I have freedom of association.
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.460]   I can find my crowd.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:22.940]   I can find the people that I click with
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.740]   and I don't have to do what everybody else does to fit in.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.740]   Then you get out in the real world
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.820]   and you discover that that was all school,
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.860]   that in the real world, you can come and go as you like.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.140]   In the real world, you can associate
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:32.980]   with people as you like.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.260]   In the real world, if you don't like somebody,
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.340]   you don't like their ideas,
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.460]   you can just walk away
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.740]   and you don't have to worry about it.
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.900]   In the real world, you can find your group,
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.580]   your group of people that you really enjoy being with,
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.140]   that make you feel good, that are true friends,
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.460]   and you can bond to those people.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.220]   And yet, the time that you're least equipped
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.460]   to manage that trauma is when you're young,
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.100]   when you don't know that's how the world works.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.740]   If any of you or I ever went back to middle school,
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.580]   we would laugh and we would just put our heads down
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.300]   and do our own thing and finish our classes
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.140]   and move on with our life.
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.260]   We wouldn't bother with all of the nonsense
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.020]   of all of the drama.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.140]   But it's a big deal to children.
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.860]   We have an epidemic of teen suicide in the United States,
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.660]   teen depression.
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.820]   The levels of happiness among young people
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:20.460]   and the psychological surveys are desperately low right now.
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:24.500]   And the levels of self-confidence, desperately low.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.980]   I don't understand why more parents don't wake up and say,
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.700]   "I'm not doing this anymore.
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.260]   "You're telling me that you've created a system
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.960]   "that seems highly likely to turn my child
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:39.960]   "into an unhappy, depressed, medicated person
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.460]   "who's considering suicide?"
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.820]   No.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.560]   So the ability to create a non-threatening environment
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.080]   for your children as a parent
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.520]   is just a profoundly empowering freedom
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.480]   where you can create a home environment that is peaceful,
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.340]   that's pleasant, that's safe,
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.820]   that's filled with love,
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.660]   where there's no physical threats.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.100]   Parents buying bulletproof backpacks for their kids
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.740]   and it's nonsense, no physical threats,
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.660]   no emotional threats.
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.020]   You can weed out all of the jerks
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.160]   who wanna make themselves feel better
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.420]   by making other people feel worse.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.980]   You can weed out a lot of the,
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.220]   you can protect your children.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.340]   And that's so important for a child to be protected.
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.660]   Tremendous benefit and a tremendous freedom
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.780]   of home education.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.860]   Next freedoms that I really appreciate
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.900]   is the freedom to learn what matters.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:43.060]   One of the major complaints I have
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.980]   against institutionalized schooling
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.640]   is that what they teach is irrelevant,
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:51.840]   largely irrelevant to real life.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.940]   There's a meme that goes around
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.460]   and shows a picture of a parallelogram
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.740]   and then it talks about,
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.740]   "Sure glad I know what a parallelogram is
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.600]   "because during the season of parallelogram season,
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.540]   "my knowledge really becomes useful."
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.180]   The play of course is tax season.
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.260]   They didn't teach me about taxes in high school,
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.940]   but they taught me about parallelograms.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.420]   But I don't care about parallelograms,
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.980]   it's hard to use that basic knowledge of geometry
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.100]   on a day to day basis,
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.660]   but the tax knowledge is really important.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.000]   Well, I have a high opinion of academics,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.140]   I really care about some of that academic knowledge,
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.980]   even if it's not directly applicable.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.740]   So I want my children to learn that,
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.420]   but I don't want them to learn that exclusively.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.580]   The way that institutionalized schooling is done
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.100]   fails most students.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.500]   If we use as a definition of success,
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.700]   that they're prepared to live
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.340]   as productive, knowledgeable adults.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.900]   There was a time when people said,
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.940]   "Well, the success formula is finish high school
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.700]   "and then you can get a good job."
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.620]   And then that success formula came to be,
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.940]   "Finish college and then you can get a good job."
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.300]   Well, now there's a whole lot of people
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.900]   from my generation that are not happy
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.100]   with the fact that they finished college,
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.180]   but they find themselves frustrated with their job
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:10.060]   or their lack of a job.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.340]   One of the most popular and fastest growing classes
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:18.740]   on college campuses are classes on adulting,
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:23.180]   where people come in and teach basic practical knowledge.
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:24.940]   It's become practically a joke,
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.020]   which I don't like when people are mean
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.380]   to entire classes of people,
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.780]   I think that's kind of ugly.
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.740]   But there's reason why millennials are stereotyped
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:36.620]   and whatever the, I forget the name of the generation below,
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.300]   but the generation coming out of college right now
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.900]   is stereotypically unskilled,
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.820]   unskilled to be successful in life.
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.860]   Stuffed with some disconnected academic ideas,
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.380]   but not able to put those things together
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.580]   into a coherent, cohesive model
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.140]   and not able to have practical skills.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.220]   I don't see why that should be the case.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.980]   I do not see why any parent should settle
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.580]   for that for their child.
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.820]   I want my child to have an immense range
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.660]   of practical skills.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:07.380]   I want them to enjoy the academic pursuits
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.860]   and I have a bias towards that,
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.380]   I like academics,
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.260]   I believe that the intellectual world is really valuable
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.660]   and if my children are well suited
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.660]   to that world of intellectual pursuits,
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.780]   I want them to succeed in that.
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.300]   I want them to be really excellent in higher mathematics
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.540]   and higher sciences and in engineering
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.260]   and in high literature.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.700]   I want them to appreciate the great ideas
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.140]   of the tremendous civilization that we're a part of.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.020]   I want them to understand and value
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.540]   the canon of Western literature.
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.740]   I want them to understand the arguments
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.300]   of the philosophers over the centuries.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.060]   To me, that's important.
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.540]   But I also want them to know how to build a house.
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.740]   I also want them to know how to back a trailer.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.780]   I want them to know how to raise their own food.
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.860]   I want them to know how to build a business.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.260]   I want them to have a wide range of skills
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.980]   that they can use to provide for themselves
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.340]   and income in the marketplace.
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.900]   One of the most difficult financial planning situations
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.340]   that I face is when I'm dealing with somebody
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.620]   who is fundamentally unskilled.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:10.740]   A number of times I've worked with usually a father
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.900]   and the father is fundamentally unskilled.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.060]   Maybe went to high school,
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.620]   did a little college here and there,
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.300]   but never developed meaningful skills.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.460]   And it's the most horrific situation to be in
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:24.580]   when you're facing a 40 year old or a 45 year old father
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.700]   who's trying to support a wife and children
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.660]   and who doesn't have practical skills
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.660]   that are valued in the marketplace.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.900]   We must help our children to develop
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.820]   sufficient practical skills
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.940]   that they can use those things to generate income
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.180]   so that they can earn at a high enough rate
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:43.020]   to support themselves, to support a family.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.420]   If you want your children to be able to support a family
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.620]   so that they can build a family culture that matters
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.020]   so you can have a multi-generational impact
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.300]   through your family,
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.100]   you have to help your children
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.580]   learn how to build a high income.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.180]   Well, there's no reason in today's world
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.300]   why that has to wait.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.300]   It's ridiculous that an 18 year old
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.980]   could come out of an institutionalized learning environment
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.780]   and not be able to go into a specific job
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.940]   where they can say, yeah, I'm worth a lot of money.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.700]   I'm worth $30 an hour here.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.020]   There's no reason for it.
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.780]   No reason whatsoever.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:18.740]   So obviously that's a big area of conversation
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.860]   to try to figure and working with your children
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.260]   to see where their interests lie,
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.020]   to see where their aptitudes lie,
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.820]   to try to figure out what the market is saying at the time.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.380]   But I think that the freedom to learn what matters
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.420]   and to build those practical skills
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.540]   is really, really important.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.540]   My best favorite model of that
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.540]   or kind of how I think it'll work out in the future,
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.380]   we'll see.
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.380]   I'll be honest with results,
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.220]   lack of results, et cetera, as I learn.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.100]   But what I think, where I think we'll come to
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.540]   as a family in the future
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.300]   is I think we'll constrain academic pursuits
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.800]   to a few hours in the morning.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:55.460]   I think three to four hours is sufficient, plenty.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.700]   A child who's doing school every day
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:02.340]   without the interruption of bells and hallways
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:06.180]   and people stuffing them in the locker and whatnot,
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:10.060]   three to four hours of focused, uninterrupted work is fine.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:14.020]   Which by the way, one of the basic skills that matters
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.980]   is just simply knowing how to study effectively.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.220]   I haven't told my wife what it's called yet,
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.340]   but my wife is working with my son
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.820]   on what's practically a Pomodoro method.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.900]   She's teaching him good skills from day one
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.180]   where at this point, now that he can read,
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.260]   most of his schooling is largely self-directed.
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.460]   She gives him a checklist,
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:35.780]   says here's the work that you're responsible for today.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.620]   Goes through his books, we listen to his narration,
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:38.700]   we listen to his reading.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.400]   But at this point, even that's not really necessary.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.240]   Give him a checklist
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.820]   and then he does the Pomodoro method.
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.260]   He does 30 minutes of work and five minutes of non-work.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.460]   30 minutes of work, five minutes of play.
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.980]   30 minutes of work, five minutes of play.
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.180]   And to the extent that he focuses,
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.380]   he can get his work done fast.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.780]   To the extent that he goofs off,
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.700]   just cuts into his other free time.
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.940]   And so that's a basic skill that's taught,
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.180]   but that's not taught in an institutionalized environment.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.440]   In an institutionalized environment,
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.900]   you have Parkinson's law in full effect.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.980]   The work always expands to fill the time allotted.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.900]   And so if I have finished an assignment quickly in school,
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.280]   I was never allowed to leave.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.660]   I was never allowed to go and goof off and play.
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.180]   No, I had to sit there and wait.
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:21.300]   And so it's just a dumb environment.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.900]   So practical skills though.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.020]   What I think will happen is that,
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.020]   especially as we do more academics in the future,
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.740]   we'll do a few hours of academics in the morning.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:29.580]   But in the afternoons,
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.100]   I want my children focusing on practical skills
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.500]   and developing real skills
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.300]   that can pay off in the marketplace.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.100]   I want them earning significant amounts of money
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:38.980]   in the afternoon.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.820]   So whether that's copywriting or doing tax prep
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.820]   or building wooden birdhouses
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:45.260]   to sell at the local green market
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.140]   or baking bread to sell to their neighbors, I don't care.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.540]   I just care that they're building those practical skills
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:51.460]   and developing them.
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.060]   And I think that this is one of the areas
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.060]   where financially we have the biggest opportunity
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.100]   to set our children ahead substantially.
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.100]   The best model I've always been inspired
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.580]   by Steve and Terry Maxwell's results with their children,
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.100]   where that all of their sons were able,
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.660]   in their early to late 20s,
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.220]   all of their sons through their own employment
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.020]   were able to work and to save enough money
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.180]   to pay cash for their first house
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.660]   with a range of prices of anywhere
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.100]   from a hundred and something thousand
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.460]   to almost $200,000,
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.340]   depending on the particular situation
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.980]   of each of their boys.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.060]   That's a tremendous legacy to leave to your children.
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.100]   The ability to earn and save money
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.500]   while they're living at home
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.020]   and to be able to start their married life
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:37.660]   in a paid-for house, tremendous.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:42.100]   I mean, that changes dramatically
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.980]   the financial experience that the average person
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.980]   experiences in their life.
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.060]   When you start in a paid-for house,
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.180]   it dramatically changes the pressure on your marriage.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.620]   It dramatically changes what your young family
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:57.340]   can look like and how well you can invest in that family.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.100]   It changes your family tree.
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.580]   And yet it's not rocket science.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:06.420]   All it is is the implementation of practical skills
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:07.820]   with academic instruction.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:11.620]   Shrink academics down to a few hours a day
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.020]   and give an opportunity for a few hours of work
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.020]   in the afternoon.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.780]   And their children have done it all in diverse areas.
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:22.300]   One of their sons is a computer engineer.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.340]   I think another one had a building business.
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.900]   One of their daughters is an extremely accomplished author,
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.580]   has published a dozen books
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.860]   by the time she was in her early 20s
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.580]   and sold lots of them.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.860]   Extremely accomplished, it's incredible.
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.220]   So the freedom to learn what matters
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.420]   is one of the things that I really treasure
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:41.100]   about using home education
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.380]   rather than going into an institutionalized environment.
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:48.220]   I think one of the other freedoms,
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.460]   and this is of course related,
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.660]   it's just the freedom of interest,
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.660]   the ability to study a child's interest
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.060]   and then to allow them to pursue
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.380]   and explore those areas of interest.
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:01.060]   If you give a child open amounts of time
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:05.620]   and they're not just medicated into not,
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.620]   whether it's actual physical drugs
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.820]   or whether just lulled by a system that destroys them
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.100]   and turns them into boredom,
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.700]   they're gonna find areas of interest
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.780]   and then give them time to pursue those things.
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.900]   As a parent, you don't need to be in charge
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.060]   of trying to tell your children
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.380]   everything they need to know.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.820]   You just need to teach them how to learn
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:22.900]   and then set them free.
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.900]   Give them some coaching, give them some guidance,
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.540]   but let them teach themselves
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.980]   and let them develop their own interests
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.020]   in the areas that they really care about.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.260]   I think the next thing is just freedom to learn
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.900]   in a style that's appropriate for your children.
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.060]   I've watched again and again and again
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.380]   students ruined by a system
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.340]   that doesn't fit their learning style
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.100]   and they don't see applicability
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:50.100]   to how what they're learning and studying
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.380]   applies to their own life.
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.460]   I'm so inspired and have been over the years,
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.340]   I need to have him back on to an update,
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.180]   which by the way, Jonathan,
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.620]   if you're listening to that, send me an email,
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.620]   I'll reach out to you,
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.660]   but I'm so inspired by Jonathan Harris,
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.500]   who I had on the show earlier in my life,
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:04.820]   in the very early in the show,
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.660]   who runs the website 10K to Talent with his children,
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.700]   that the way that he integrates their education
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:16.700]   and modern business skills is really, really impressive.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:21.260]   So for example, his children, for their English assignments,
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.220]   for their writing assignments, they do writing assignments,
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:26.260]   but he has them do those writing assignments
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.340]   based upon a particular area of interest,
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.980]   particular area of talent,
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:33.500]   and with some sort of broader appeal.
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.780]   So if his, one of Caleb, who listens to the show,
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.380]   I've talked about here and there,
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.860]   Caleb is into knife making.
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:43.780]   So Caleb's English assignments were to write a newsletter
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.580]   to other people who were wanting to learn about knife making.
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.900]   So he would write the essays for his newsletter,
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.020]   and those were his English assignments.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.340]   One of his daughters is into horses,
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.980]   and so she would write about horses to her newsletter,
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.940]   to her website, publishing her information
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.300]   as part of her work.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.380]   So now you're starting to have this stacking effect,
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.540]   layering effect of skills.
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:06.740]   Yes, you're learning to write,
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.340]   but you're not just writing some random essay
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:09.420]   that your teacher's gonna read,
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.500]   put a letter grade at top, and then throw away.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.780]   You're writing an essay that you're publishing online,
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:15.420]   so thus you're learning WordPress,
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.100]   or you're learning how to run an email list,
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.100]   and you're doing it over a thing that you're interested in,
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.300]   so you're learning more about that thing
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.140]   that you're interested in,
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.780]   and that can expand into another career.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.740]   The ability to use a child's unique learning style
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:29.140]   is, I think, a secret weapon that will help the child
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:33.260]   to get way more, way more benefit,
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.300]   and to develop far more confidence
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:36.500]   in their ability to learn,
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.340]   and their ability to execute.
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.140]   And the next freedom that I appreciate so much
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.740]   is just the freedom to choose the moral instruction
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.340]   that your child receives.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:48.020]   It is one of the most important fundamental rights
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.340]   that you have as a parent,
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:51.660]   is to choose the moral instruction
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.420]   that your child gets to receive.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:54.900]   If you wanna see how people try
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.780]   to accomplish a moral revolution,
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.260]   almost always it starts with the children,
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.420]   and that's where, when you look at different societies
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.660]   where there have been profound moral revolutions,
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.180]   one of the biggest, hottest battlegrounds of that
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:10.180]   is the children, and what the children are allowed to learn,
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.060]   and how they're allowed to learn it.
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.380]   As a parent, you should never give up
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.980]   your fundamental right to choose
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.020]   what your children are taught.
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:23.460]   In a public school, you don't get to choose what's taught,
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.100]   and you don't get to choose who teaches it.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.980]   Parents who send their children to government school
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:30.780]   will usually spend way more time
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.740]   vetting a simple babysitter
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.840]   who's gonna be with their child once every few weeks
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.020]   for an hour or a couple hours,
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:41.300]   than they do choosing the people
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:45.380]   who are gonna be with their children for an hour a day,
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.740]   to cumulatively seven hours a day,
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.960]   cumulatively 15 to 18,000 hours
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.660]   over the course of a child's life.
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:57.040]   To outsource that without any screening,
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.420]   without any thought,
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.020]   and to give the most valuable 18,000 hours
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:04.740]   of your child's life, their moral instruction,
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.620]   their character instruction,
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.620]   the way they view the world,
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:12.060]   to outsource that to people that are randomly selected
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.020]   by government agents that you didn't choose either,
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.020]   is insane.
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.060]   That's a public school.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.100]   You don't get to choose what's taught,
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.340]   you don't get to choose who teaches it.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.500]   In a private school,
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:23.780]   you don't get to choose who teaches it,
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.100]   but at least you can choose some of what's taught,
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.360]   but you still don't get to choose how it's taught.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.340]   You can choose and say,
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:30.900]   "Okay, I'm gonna enroll my children
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.260]   "in the local Catholic school,
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:33.580]   "the local Jewish school,
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:36.500]   "or the local non-denominational Christian school,
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.260]   "or the local STEM school."
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.180]   You can choose some of what's taught
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.860]   if you're choosing a certain private education,
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:47.300]   but you still don't get much say over who the teachers are.
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.180]   You're kind of just given those people,
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:51.900]   and you still don't know anything about them.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.340]   You have to trust the system to vet them a little bit,
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.620]   that, "Okay, I want my child to get a Catholic education,
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:58.940]   "so we're gonna hope that the school's gonna stand up for it,"
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.140]   but you don't know that,
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.540]   and you still don't get to choose how it's taught.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:05.140]   It's not taught in a way that's unique to your child,
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:08.140]   but in home education, you have the freedom to choose it all.
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:10.220]   You get to choose what's taught,
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:12.020]   you get to choose who teaches it,
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.660]   and you get to choose how it's taught.
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:18.740]   That's powerful, and it's the most important,
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:22.180]   one of the most important freedoms of parents
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.620]   that they just, so many people give up unthinkingly.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.220]   I don't get it.
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:30.920]   I don't get why people give up the freedoms that they have.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.220]   So in summary, these are just some of the freedoms
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.120]   that I personally really appreciate.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:41.380]   I appreciate the freedom that I have as a parent,
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.580]   and how home education has enhanced those freedoms,
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:47.800]   and the freedoms for my children.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.980]   I want my children to be free of a bunch of things.
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:52.500]   I want my children to be free of the trauma
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.860]   that so many children come out of childhood with.
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.620]   I want my children to have the freedom
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.780]   to study the things that they're interested in.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.060]   I want my children to have the freedom
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.820]   to develop at their own pace.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:03.180]   I want my children to have the freedom
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:06.180]   to have self-confidence based on their successfully
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.400]   developing the skills of learning.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.560]   I want my children to have the freedom
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.800]   to come and go throughout the world.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.340]   I want my children to have the freedom
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.340]   to associate with people who make them feel good,
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.000]   who inspire them, instead of people who bully them,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.360]   and tear them down, and corrupt them.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:23.280]   I don't think you can make a case
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.540]   that children automatically make you freer.
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:29.500]   Certainly you as an individual
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.980]   can probably achieve a higher level of personal freedom
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:35.720]   if you don't get married, if you don't have children.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.380]   You can come and go around the world
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.220]   like a vagabond, totally free.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.620]   So I have to concede that,
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:41.660]   that I don't think that children
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.740]   make you as an individual freer.
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.980]   But I didn't have children because I wanted to be freer.
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.580]   I had children because I wanted to have a family,
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.260]   and I wanted to have a multi-generational
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.100]   impact on the world.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.420]   And that's gonna require a lot of work.
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:57.860]   But what I've found is that with these choices,
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.980]   with children with home education,
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:04.740]   I enjoy a very high level of freedom.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:06.660]   It's not as high as it would be if I was an individual,
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.140]   but that life is not fulfilling.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:10.620]   It's never been attractive to me, I hated it.
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:14.700]   But when you have the ability to come and go as you like,
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.500]   live where you like, schedule your time as you like,
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.060]   schedule your week as you like,
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:24.140]   it's tremendously positive.
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.340]   So if you care about freedom, all I ask of you is this.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:32.260]   Consider educating your children at home.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:36.260]   That doesn't mean that you have to do all the teaching.
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.020]   There are a few basic objections
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:41.620]   that seem to always come up.
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.340]   And so very quickly, let me just answer just a few of these.
[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:46.660]   There are probably more, but I just have a few.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.220]   Number one, the basic objection that always comes up
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.980]   is what about the socialization of my children?
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:54.420]   When you home educate, you have the ability
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.180]   to socialize your children in the best way possible.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.260]   Whatever you think is the best way, you can do that.
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:03.380]   That's the dumbest argument,
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:05.780]   but it's the most common argument.
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:07.340]   I've separately done a Facebook video on that.
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:08.180]   If you'd like to see that,
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.860]   go to facebook.com/joshuascheats
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.420]   where I give you five arguments
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:13.460]   as to why that's a dumb argument,
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.260]   the socialization of your children.
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:17.140]   If you choose to educate your children at home,
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.220]   you can socialize them among the very best people
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.600]   that you want to socialize with them with.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.780]   If that means a bunch of people of their own age, great.
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:25.700]   If that means a bunch of people
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.620]   that are four times their age, great.
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:30.020]   You can choose the socialization of your child.
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:33.380]   You cannot choose who socializes your child
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:36.300]   when you put them into an institutional environment.
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.060]   The next thing is, well, how am I gonna teach
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.100]   all this stuff that I don't know?
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.180]   Ridiculous.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:46.260]   First, the basic, and this especially affects moms
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.100]   where often it's like,
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:48.660]   I don't have the confidence to teach my child.
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:49.900]   I only have a master's degree,
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.980]   but I'm not sure that I'm a great teacher.
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.580]   It's insane.
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.020]   First of all, teaching children is easy,
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.260]   especially at the early years.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.260]   A fourth grader can competently teach a third grader.
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.020]   In fact, it's one of the most powerful ways
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:04.140]   for that fourth grader to cement their learning
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:06.340]   is to teach a third grader.
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.620]   I see this happening with my children.
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.180]   They teach one another to read.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:12.420]   So all you need to know is a little bit more.
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:13.660]   And the stuff that we're talking about
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:16.580]   in the early years of education is just so basic
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.260]   that literally your children can do the teaching.
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:20.860]   And they probably should for their own good
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.740]   and to some degree.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.300]   Second thing is the most important skill
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:26.460]   to come out of schooling is the ability
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:30.260]   to be a self-directed learner, the ability to learn.
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.780]   Not the ability to be a student, but the ability to learn,
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:36.500]   which often requires you to just simply pull back
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:40.220]   and force the child to learn to teach themselves.
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:42.140]   I'm convinced that one of the most important things
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:45.580]   is to get the child to learn how to teach themselves.
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:47.980]   Because as an adult, you don't always have a teacher.
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:50.420]   But if you have the ability to say, I know how to learn,
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.700]   I know how to read a book,
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:52.980]   I know how to go and look for a book,
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:55.180]   I know how to go and find a teacher,
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:56.780]   you have the ability to learn.
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.240]   You're here listening to me right now
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.140]   because you value what I'm teaching you.
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:04.340]   Nobody forced you to do this.
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:06.500]   You went and looked for the information
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.240]   and thus you're receiving it.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.260]   So this is part of your learning.
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.540]   And so the basic skill that children need
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:15.060]   is to learn how to teach themselves.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:17.980]   And that should happen by middle elementary school.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:20.100]   And basically from then on,
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:22.300]   a parent should be more of a coach,
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:26.280]   more of an advisor than specifically a teacher.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:31.440]   And then of course the other obvious solution
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.860]   is that when a teacher is needed,
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.900]   you go out and find the best teacher for your child.
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:39.680]   Now that teacher might be to go and take a class
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.020]   at a local school.
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.580]   If your child is studying chemistry
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:45.940]   and you don't have the financial ability
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.940]   to provide a fully equipped chemistry lab
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.240]   and you believe that my child will learn chemistry
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.540]   more effectively if they can go down to the local school
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:55.840]   and they can enroll in the chemistry class there,
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:59.880]   send them down and let them take the chemistry class.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.140]   That's entirely within your prerogative as a parent.
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:03.500]   And that's what you should do.
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.500]   Tons of homeschool students do that.
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.700]   Parents enroll them in a class at the local high school,
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.340]   parents enroll them in a class at the local college,
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:10.940]   et cetera, or you can go and find
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:12.100]   the world's greatest teacher online.
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.180]   You wanna teach your child Spanish,
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:14.460]   your child wants to learn Spanish
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:17.580]   and you don't know Spanish, italki.com.
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.320]   Sign your child up, have them tutored
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.760]   by a native Spanish speaker every day,
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.740]   right in the comfort of their own home.
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:25.340]   Your job is just simply to help them connect that.
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:30.340]   And you can easily put the connections there for your child.
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:33.700]   Tremendously valuable.
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.180]   So there are other objections,
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:36.100]   but you know what I forgot to talk about?
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:37.620]   I gotta finish the show.
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:39.340]   I appreciate the financial freedom
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.620]   that comes from home education.
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:45.860]   To get a world-class education for cheap.
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:48.860]   I was the other day looking at the high school
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.260]   that I graduated from and I was looking
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.960]   at their tuition rates.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.180]   And I was considering how much they cost.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.300]   And that high school currently has a tuition rate
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.780]   for high school of just under $20,000 per year.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:02.460]   And I was imagining myself enrolling my children
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:05.060]   into that high school.
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.420]   And I was just thinking about that.
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.540]   I was doing the math, all right, $20,000 per year.
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.980]   Of course, I have four children.
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:13.820]   20, 40, 60, $80,000 per year.
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:20.540]   Then I was imagining what can I do for $20,000 a year?
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:23.860]   What can I do for $40,000 a year?
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.980]   What can I do for $80,000 a year?
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:31.500]   Friend, if you can't think of how to spend $20,000 per year
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:33.420]   better than the local private school,
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.820]   you haven't exposed yourself to enough interesting ideas.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.980]   For $20,000 a year, I can hire a private tutor,
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.300]   give them room and board,
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:43.620]   and have a private tutor in my home
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:46.380]   to care for my child.
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.100]   There are lots of very smart
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:50.060]   and lots of very learned people
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.420]   that would take room and board
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:53.820]   and a $20,000 per year stipend
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:56.620]   to live in my home or live in a little guest quarters
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.540]   out back, maybe have a maid quarters or something like that
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:00.820]   where they can live.
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:02.180]   And they have the ability,
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:05.100]   all they gotta do is tutor one child.
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.700]   Tutor one child and the rest of their time,
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.540]   they can work on their own things.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:10.940]   I could find PhDs the world over
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:14.500]   who would come in and do that for $20,000 a year.
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.380]   So just that in and of itself, fairly traditional.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.660]   Right there, I've solved my teacher problem
[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:21.940]   for $20,000 a year.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:23.500]   Now you're telling me that my child's
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.220]   gonna get better results being in a class
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.300]   of hundreds of other people
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.980]   with a student to teacher ratio of 25 to one
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.540]   versus a full-time tutor in my home.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.140]   I can't buy it.
[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:33.780]   I cannot buy that.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:35.900]   Now, you give me the world and you say,
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:39.340]   "Joshua, you've gotta spend $20,000 per year
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:40.940]   "on each of your children."
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:44.220]   I can enroll them in the world's greatest classes.
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:45.820]   I can take them all over the world.
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:47.660]   I can do tremendous.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.540]   But the point I'm making though is that
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:51.260]   most people don't have $80,000 a year
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.380]   to spend on their four children's education.
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:54.860]   But you don't need to spend that.
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:56.540]   A few thousand dollars a year
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:59.100]   provides a world-class education.
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:01.740]   I didn't cite this number exactly,
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.740]   so forgive me if I'm wrong,
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.740]   but from past research,
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.340]   I think the average homeschool student
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:09.580]   spends about $600 a year on their homeschool curriculum,
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:10.660]   things like that.
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:14.380]   Now, that doesn't count the time value,
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:16.460]   the time value of mom or dad
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.820]   or whoever's involved with their instruction.
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:21.880]   But in terms of actual money out of pocket, it's tiny.
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:26.300]   So I'm not gonna spend $20,000 per year per child
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.020]   to send my child to a private school.
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:30.140]   Not gonna put them in a government school.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:31.900]   So homeschooling is by far
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:36.060]   one of the best financial expenses you could possibly have.
[00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:38.460]   It's incredible.
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:43.340]   Obviously, there are some schools
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:44.780]   that are not that expensive,
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:47.180]   just that I was doing the math myself.
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:48.980]   The only thing, by the way, I will point out,
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:50.740]   the only thing I've never been able to try to,
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:53.780]   never been able to replicate
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.380]   in that I don't know how to replicate
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:56.460]   in a homeschool environment
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:59.420]   are just things that require lots of other children.
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.220]   So for example, the school that I graduated from
[00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:03.180]   has a world-class theater program,
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.740]   and I always enjoyed the theater program,
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:06.600]   performing in musicals, et cetera.
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:10.500]   I don't know how you do that in homeschooling.
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.900]   I can replace socialization.
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.680]   I can do, I have lots of friends,
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.060]   lots of strong social groups for my children.
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:20.500]   I can't replace a theater program without that.
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.100]   Now, the nice thing is that some schools,
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:24.260]   especially some government schools,
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:25.340]   allow you to bring your children
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.100]   and just enroll them in certain classes.
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.380]   So let's say you want your children to be in band.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:30.780]   Well, you can take them and enroll them in band class,
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.740]   and they go for band class, and they go for band practice,
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:35.300]   but they just don't go to classes the rest of the time.
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.460]   So that would be one way.
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:39.260]   But if I had a child that was really interested
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:42.220]   in something like theater, I can't replicate that
[00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:46.620]   in a homeschool, maybe the professional theater group.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.860]   So those are the kinds of things
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:49.420]   that if you look at your own family,
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:50.980]   and you look at your children, you say,
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.460]   all right, this is a good reason for us
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:54.420]   to choose this particular institution.
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:56.480]   And you have that freedom as a parent.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.220]   Listen, you have this freedom,
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:00.540]   and especially in the United States, and the world over,
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:02.980]   and by the way, in three shows,
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:05.260]   I'm gonna talk to you how to have freedom
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:06.420]   for things like homeschooling,
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:08.380]   even if you are in a country
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:09.540]   that makes homeschooling illegal.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.580]   We're talking about freedom from state control.
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:13.260]   But if you're in the United States,
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.740]   there is a whole generation of people
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:19.260]   that fought in the courts for decades
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:23.100]   to get that freedom for you, and I beg of you, use it.
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:26.180]   Don't keep your children enrolled in a system
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.580]   that was designed for the 1800s,
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:32.060]   a factory system that's almost guaranteed
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:34.140]   to make them hate learning,
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.980]   to expose them to corrupting, wicked influences
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.500]   on a day-to-day basis,
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:42.780]   to expose them to deep trauma in their psychology,
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.740]   and they come out with a diploma
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:48.020]   that basically gets them nothing
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:50.060]   except potentially access to a college,
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:51.940]   which basically gets them nothing
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:55.640]   from a career instruction, career aspect,
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.660]   except possibly the ability to go and get a job
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:58.500]   that they're not gonna like,
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:00.820]   and then they're gonna start reading online
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.340]   and find a financial independence forum,
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:05.300]   and well, how, if I just work this crazy job
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:06.820]   for work, work, work, work for 10 years,
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:08.700]   then I can be financially free and do what I really want.
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.460]   Why set your children up for that system?
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.660]   It's a stupid system.
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:14.460]   Why not set them up for a lifestyle of freedom
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:15.700]   from the beginning?
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.220]   Why not give them the freedom to study
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.720]   the things that they care about?
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.820]   Why not give them the freedom to be exposed
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:22.540]   to lots of things so that they have
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:24.740]   a much more creative approach to life?
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.420]   Why not give them the financial freedom to earn money
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.380]   so that they develop useful skills
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:30.880]   during the years when all their peers
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:32.780]   are wasting their time?
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.420]   Why not give them the ability to graduate
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:37.060]   from high school with $100,000 in the bank,
[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:39.760]   to start a business, or to be financially free,
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.860]   or pay cash for a house, or travel the world,
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:43.060]   or whatever they wanna do?
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.180]   Why not start them on a lifestyle of freedom?
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:48.300]   Why put them into this same broken system
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:51.380]   that results in broken people who hate their lives
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:52.740]   and are deeply unhappy?
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:58.440]   If you care about freedom, and if you have children,
[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.080]   you're gonna want better results for your children.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.420]   Now my ways might not be perfect, right?
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:08.080]   I'm sure that there are things that I don't know about
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.040]   because I don't have a 16-year-old
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.060]   that I'm working with right now.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.700]   I'm sure of it, and I'll tell you when I'm wrong.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.120]   I promise you that, I promised you that
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.460]   from day one of this show.
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.300]   I'll tell you when I'm wrong,
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:19.140]   I'll tell you when I've developed,
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.300]   and I try to do that from time to time.
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.440]   Say, here's where things I got wrong.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.880]   But the point is that whatever it is,
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.020]   let's apply the same level of creativity
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.740]   and personalization and modern thinking
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:32.020]   to our children's lives and lifestyles
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.420]   with the hope of setting them a little bit ahead
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.020]   of the start that perhaps you and I had.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:40.140]   It's all I hope to inspire you to do.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.260]   If you care about freedom,
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:46.020]   my third ring of freedom is this, family liberty.
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:48.260]   The ability to educate your child
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.240]   on a path that leads to liberty.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.340]   The ability to infuse your child
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:53.960]   with an ideology of liberty.
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:58.340]   I'm trying not to make this show too personal,
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:00.300]   but I don't want my children taught
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:01.880]   that the way they get ahead is by voting
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.020]   for somebody who's gonna give them
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.460]   more government cheese that's stolen from someone else.
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:08.420]   I want my children to have an ideology of work hard,
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:11.440]   provide for yourself, and don't steal from your neighbors.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.180]   Can't do that in a government school.
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.740]   Can't do that in homeschool.
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:16.380]   Freedom of moral instruction.
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:18.540]   To instruct your children in a moral,
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:21.220]   in a sense of morality that's going to serve them
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.560]   instead of destroy them.
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:25.960]   Don't waste your freedoms.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.060]   Consider what's right for you and your family,
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.500]   but I beg of you, give a serious thought
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.180]   to how your personal lifestyle as a parent
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:35.620]   and how the lifestyles of your children
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:38.940]   can become more free by home education.
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:43.080]   If I had to work a job, if I had to do all these things,
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.740]   but I knew I could come home every day
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:47.640]   and have the confidence that my children were free,
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:51.660]   my wife were free, I'd do it pretty happily.
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:54.020]   Now, tomorrow, the next episode,
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.340]   we'll talk about some ways, though,
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.660]   that your family can enjoy increasing financial liberty.
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.380]   We'll talk about financial liberty, liberty of income,
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.280]   and then we'll talk about freedom from state control
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.660]   and full and complete financial independence.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:06.580]   Stay with me.
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:08.560]   If you're interested in my personal consulting services,
