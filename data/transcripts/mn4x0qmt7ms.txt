[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   A podcast listener named Kathy writes in, "Pastor John, I just finished listening to
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.480]   the recent APJ episode titled 'Glorifying God in Unshakable Grief.'
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.280]   Before I ask my question, may I first say thank you, Pastor John, to you and to Pastor
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.720]   Tom Steller for the years I spent at Bethlehem Baptist Church in the 1980s and early 1990s,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.120]   during which time I was well taught by you both and grounded in the sovereignty of God.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.840]   That foundation has been crucial for my coping in recent years.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.840]   My youngest son, Josiah, was diagnosed with bone cancer in July 2013 at the age of 12,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.440]   and the period of his treatment was really hard, full of intense pain and sickness for
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.440]   him and anxiety for us all.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.960]   By the end of his treatment in September 2014, we thought he had come through it.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.200]   However, at his first post-treatment check, we were told that his cancer had returned,
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.640]   riddled his lungs, and he died in April 2015 at the age of 14.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.120]   I am thankful that the Lord had given Josiah a faith that enabled him to face death without
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.040]   fear and I have confidence that Josiah is now with Jesus.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.360]   And I hold onto the truth that in some way this is part of a plan that makes sense.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.800]   But the grief has frequently felt unbearable and now, just over two years later, it still
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.060]   comes crashing in waves that at times feel impossible to withstand.
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.680]   My question comes from something I read recently in your book, Future Grace.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.040]   At the end of chapter 2, you write, "When faith in God's future grace is strong, the
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.640]   message is sent that this kind of God makes no mistakes, so that everything he has done
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.400]   in the past is part of a good plan and can be remembered with gratitude.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.920]   Only if we trust God to turn past calamities into future comfort can we look back with
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.920]   gratitude for all things."
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.140]   Gratitude for all things is my question.
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.540]   I can say thank you Lord for being with us during Josiah's suffering, but it is difficult
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.400]   for me to say thank you Lord for Josiah's suffering.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.380]   I can't get there, certainly not on an emotional level.
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.240]   Can you help me see what it looks like or feels like to be able to say thank you God
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.860]   for this deep suffering?
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.080]   I will try.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.380]   But first, let me overflow with praise.
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.980]   And this praise really is part of the answer.
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:40.360]   First, my heart, Kathy, is rising up in praise to God for your words.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:49.860]   I am thankful that the Lord had given Josiah a face that enabled him to face death without
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.280]   fear.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.940]   That is a staggering miracle.
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.820]   There are millions of professing Christians who claim to have walked with God for years
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.280]   who don't come close to that kind of faith.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:14.980]   Few things, if any, cause me to stand in awe of the grace of God more than a 14-year-old
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:26.300]   with genuine faith, real, authentic faith that gives him the peace in the hour of death.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:35.540]   That is glory upon glory upon glory, and I say it not oblivious of the horror upon horror
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:45.540]   upon horror of the process of dying, and perhaps a worse experience for a mom watching a child
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.540]   die.
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:55.000]   In fact, it's the horror of it that makes the faith so unspeakably amazing.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.220]   That's my first overflow of praise.
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:06.180]   And my second one is for your words, Kathy, I hold on to the truth that in some way this
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.060]   is part of a plan that makes sense.
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:19.740]   Well, that holding on to God's Word is another amazing miracle of God's grace, which I suppose
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:26.580]   in a mother's heart is only a little less marvelous than her son's own faith.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.260]   So Kathy, let it sink in right now that what you have been through and what Josiah went
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:44.660]   through is right now in my heart here in Minneapolis in 2017, in my mouth of praise and on this
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:52.660]   podcast reverberating out to thousands around the world, what is here is the reason the
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:01.420]   universe exists, namely praise to the glory of the grace of God in and through your family.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.940]   Realize that.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:11.980]   And then, Kathy, let me draw out an implication from something the Apostle Paul said that
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.380]   you are very familiar with but maybe haven't thought of in quite this way.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:25.940]   You remember that he reminded the Thessalonians about deceased believers and the second coming.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:33.220]   He said it was a glorious thing, namely the second coming and their resurrection, and
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.140]   it is so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.900]   First Thessalonians 4.13.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:48.260]   Now, we sometimes cite this at funerals to give permission to believers to grieve, and
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.820]   that's exactly right.
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.100]   We should.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.140]   But what is not as often noticed, I think, is that the word "grieve" in the Greek is
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.900]   a present tense which implies that grieving is not a moment.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.480]   It is not an event.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.420]   It is ongoing experience.
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:15.980]   That's the implication, a continuing activity, which I think means that when you say the
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:23.700]   grief has frequently felt unbearable and now, just over two years later, it still comes
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:33.180]   crashing in waves that at times feel impossible to withstand, Paul would know exactly what
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:40.580]   you mean, just as I know what you mean, and he would say, "I spoke these words for that
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.820]   grief as well."
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:54.180]   You will be grieving Josiah's death the rest of your life because his loss to you and all
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:03.300]   the potentialities of his life which were lost will be real and lost for the rest of
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.540]   your life.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.780]   Grief is not a moment.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:15.100]   Grief is an emotional experience of painful loss, and that loss never ceases to be lost
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.380]   in this world.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:25.180]   So Kathy, we're already deep into answering your all-important question, namely, can you
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:36.260]   help me see what it looks like or feels like to be able to say thank you for this kind
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.860]   of suffering?
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:48.540]   Saying thank you for Josiah's loss, God's strange timing in taking your precious son,
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.900]   does not mean that this was not a massive loss.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.620]   That's the first part of the answer that we've already seen.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:03.500]   It is a loss worthy of being grieved until the day you die, and it is possible.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.500]   This is the mystery.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:10.700]   It is possible, emotionally possible by the work of the Holy Spirit, the kind, powerful,
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.220]   gentle Holy Spirit.
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:19.260]   It is possible to feel thankful for something painful while being almost emotionally overwhelmed
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.260]   by the pain.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.260]   Yes, it is.
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:27.820]   Now, there are two more things I want to say about that, but before I say them, my guess
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:33.300]   is there are some listeners, Kathy, who heard your question, and they're saying, "Oh, whoa,
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:39.740]   whoa, whoa, she misquoted the Bible when she asked about being thankful for this horrible
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.540]   thing instead of being thankful in it."
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.660]   But of course, you know and I know that you are right.
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.780]   It is both.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:57.580]   First Thessalonians 5.18, "Give thanks in all circumstances."
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:06.420]   Ephesians 5.20, "Giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.820]   of the Lord Jesus."
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.400]   You know what you're talking about.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.540]   It's a real question, and you're right to ask it.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:19.060]   So here are my two last things that are on my heart to say.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:26.820]   First, God knows what it is like to give His Son in horrible suffering and death.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:33.540]   Romans 8.32 says, "He did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all."
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:40.420]   And in those words, "He did not spare," we are supposed to hear something of God's heart
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.940]   in the giving and the loss of His Son in suffering and death.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:52.540]   And then we read in verse 8 of chapter 5, God shows His love for us in that while we
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.660]   were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:04.020]   Now, when we put those two passages together, the love of God for us is magnified both by
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:12.100]   the immeasurable cost in God's losing His Son in death and by the fact that He embraced
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.100]   this loss for people who didn't deserve it.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:28.620]   Few things make my blood boil more than hearing leaders of God's people describe this greatest
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:34.860]   act of love for us as cosmic Chaldebes.
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:48.820]   We live in a horrible, horrible, horrible world.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:59.660]   And I say that even as this very moment, I am looking out my window on a gorgeous, bright,
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:09.660]   beautiful summer day with a magnificent green shining maple tree in my front yard and through
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:14.940]   it a beautiful cityscape of Minneapolis just beyond.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:22.020]   And in this room, air conditioning in my own home, and as I sit here, believe it or not,
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:28.860]   at age 71, not one pain in my body as I record this.
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:39.580]   But when I look at the cross, I conclude either this world is horrible, horrible, horrible
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:49.460]   in the bondage of eternally damning sin, or the death of the Son of God was a wild overreaction
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.540]   or a myth.
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.960]   Well, God be praised.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.660]   It was not an overreaction.
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.580]   And it is not a myth.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.660]   God really does have an infinitely precious Son.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:15.100]   He really does love Him beyond all imagining, and He really did give Him up, did not spare
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:20.140]   Him in death for undeserving sinners.
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:27.220]   And He, in the loss of His Son, knows what you feel.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.460]   One more thing.
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:33.060]   What does it feel like to be thankful for a painful loss?
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:39.740]   And the last thing I want to say is it changes, Kathy, over time what it feels like.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:45.840]   I'm talking about the feeling of thankfulness now, not the unchangeable, objective reality
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:52.180]   of God's good and wise purposes, which you are holding fast to.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:59.980]   Consider the analogy of chemotherapy for a fatal and malignant tumor that you have.
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:07.100]   Suppose the doctor can assure you, and I know this is imaginary, but let's do it.
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:15.340]   Suppose the doctor can assure you that if you endure these treatments, you will be cancer-free.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.780]   And as you begin, the tumor is the size of a baseball.
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.220]   You lose your hair.
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.440]   You break out in horrible rashes.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:31.740]   You experience nausea most of the day, week after week.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.900]   Your mind is confused.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.760]   You are so weak you can scarcely drag yourself through the day.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:43.060]   Your face changes color and you look like you're almost dead already, and you're supposed
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.660]   to be thankful for this treatment.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:56.940]   Now at first, that feeling of thankfulness is simply the emotional confidence you have
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.940]   in the doctor's promise, not much more.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:08.460]   But three months later, after a CAT scan, he says the tumor has shrunk to the size of
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:16.400]   a walnut and something happens to your feeling of gratitude in the midst of all that pain.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.140]   It takes on a new emotional possibility.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:25.620]   And when you go in three months later and he says, "No trace of cancer," your feelings
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:31.280]   about those horrible treatments are very different.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:39.140]   And all I'm saying by that analogy, don't press every point of it, all I'm saying is
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:49.760]   that the feeling of gratitude for something horrible changes over time with greater and
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.940]   greater closeness of God and the revelation of what he's doing.
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:15:02.720]   Two years after the loss of your son is a very short time.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.560]   Hold fast to the doctor's promise.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:12.320]   He will show you little by little, though not entirely in this life, what he's doing.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:18.120]   Thank you, Pastor John, for those God-centered words, pastorally applied with care and with
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   tenderness.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.120]   And Kathy, thanks for the well-articulated question, really painful but good and helpful.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.600]   Thank you for putting your story and your struggle into words for all of us.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.400]   And thank you for joining us.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.400]   Thanks for listening.
