[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.080]   We are far too easily pleased.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.920]   That's the problem in America.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.400]   We're not too hedonistic, too pleasure-centered.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.440]   No, we're not pleasure-centered enough.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.080]   We settle for the world's paltry joys
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.320]   at the expense of giving our lives
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.500]   to pursue our deepest and most lasting joy.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.520]   And in settling for the trivial pleasures of this world,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.920]   we undermine both of our chief callings in life,
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.520]   the two great love commandments that we have,
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.840]   to love God with everything that we have
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.800]   and to love others as ourselves.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.160]   In fact, it's only as we pursue our highest joy
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.600]   that we are driven to enact these loves.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.600]   Essential but counterintuitive point
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.440]   that we make in Christian hedonism, Christian hedonism.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.520]   And it was a point Pastor John was making back in 1983
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.520]   as he was first putting that Christian hedonism
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.000]   into a sermon series for his church.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.880]   From that essential series would come the book,
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.440]   "Desiring God" and of course this entire ministry.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.920]   And today I wanna share with you a clip from his sermon,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.500]   "The Labor of Christian Hedonism,"
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.240]   a sermon preached on October 2nd, 1983.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.100]   Have a listen to this point.
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.920]   If you and I don't pursue our ministry
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.800]   because we expect to find great joy in it,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.160]   then we don't pursue the command of God.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.960]   There's another verse.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.280]   This one is so familiar you don't need to look it up.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.840]   It's Acts 20, verse 35.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.800]   And strikingly, it's Paul's address
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.280]   to another group of elders.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.200]   And listen to how he motivates those elders
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.520]   to care for the weak.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.920]   Remember the words of the Lord Jesus,
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.200]   how he said, "It is more blessed, elders,
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.640]   to give than to receive."
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.280]   Now, when Paul says, "Remember this,
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.000]   keep it in your mind,"
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.140]   he must mean that when it's in your mind,
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.000]   it functions rightly as a conscious motive for ministry.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.920]   He must mean that the moral value
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.440]   of our generosity in ministry
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.760]   isn't ruined when we pursue it hedonistically.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.640]   Like so many people think, it is.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.040]   It is not wrong to desire and to pursue
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.200]   the blessedness which Jesus promised
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.800]   when he said it is more blessed to give
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   than to receive.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.360]   He didn't say, "Now this is the truth,
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.880]   and get it out of your head as soon as you can,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.200]   unless you do it."
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.200]   Pursue the blessedness that comes from giving,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.360]   which brings us back to where we were last week.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.480]   What's the hindrance to love in the church?
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.240]   It's the same hindrance to worship.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.280]   The thing that keeps us from obeying
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.840]   the first vertical commandment
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.080]   is the same thing that keeps us from obeying
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.640]   the second horizontal commandment.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.320]   And it is not that we are all trying
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.040]   to please ourselves,
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.440]   but that we are far too easily pleased.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.480]   We don't really believe Jesus
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.160]   when he says there's more joy,
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.800]   more blessedness,
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.840]   more full and lasting pleasure in giving
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.560]   in a life devoted to helping others
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.640]   than there is in a life devoted
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.600]   to our material comfort.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.200]   We don't believe it.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.600]   And therefore, the very longing for contentment
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.040]   that according to Jesus ought to drive us
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.760]   to simplicity of life and labors of love
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.800]   contents itself instead with the broken cisterns
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.480]   of American prosperity and comfort.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.160]   The message that needs to be shouted
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.680]   from the top of the IDS tower
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.000]   in the city center to pleasure-seeking Americans
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.880]   is this, "Hey Americans,
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.040]   you're not nearly hedonistic enough.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.920]   Don't lay up for yourselves
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.440]   treasures on earth where moth and rust corrupt
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.200]   and where thieves break in and steal.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.280]   Go for broke.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   Lay up for yourselves
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.760]   treasures in heavens where no moth
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.440]   and rust corrupt,
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.280]   where no thieves can break in and steal.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.480]   Quit being satisfied with little five and a quarter percent
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.840]   yields of pleasure that get eaten up
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.360]   with the moths of inflation
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.320]   and the rust of death.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.400]   Invest in the blue chip,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.160]   high yield divinely insured securities of heaven."
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.480]   A life devoted to material comforts and thrills
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.000]   is like throwing money down a rat hole.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.680]   But a life simplified for the sake of love
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.600]   yields dividends unsurpassed and unending.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.080]   Hear the word of the Lord,
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.080]   O Americans.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.120]   Sell your possessions,
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.920]   give alms,
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.560]   provide for yourselves purses
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.960]   that do not grow old
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.560]   and treasures in the heavens that do not fail.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.000]   Come on!
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.960]   Become real hedonists.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.880]   Wake up!
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.720]   That's the message.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.720]   We've got gospel.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.720]   We've got good news to share with the world.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   Leave the broken cisterns of temporary,
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.840]   unsatisfying pleasures.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.480]   Come to Christ in whose presence there is
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.880]   fullness of joy and pleasures forevermore.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.240]   Join us in the labor of Christian hedonism.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.520]   For the Lord has spoken,
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.000]   it is more blessed to love than to live in luxury.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Oh, that we believed it.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.280]   That the Lord's word were believable to us.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.520]   Turn to Hebrews chapter 10.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.480]   I am just amazed at what I've seen
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.160]   in Hebrews 10, 11, and 12.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.400]   He is so amazingly consistent in his Christian hedonism.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.880]   It's phenomenal.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.880]   Hebrews 10, and we'll read 32-34.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.720]   "Recall the former days,
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.360]   when after you were enlightened,
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.080]   you endured a hard struggle with sufferings,
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.880]   sometimes being publicly exposed
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.200]   to abuse and affliction,
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.680]   and sometimes being partners with those so treated.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.680]   For you had compassion on the prisoners,
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.800]   and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property,
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.360]   since you knew that you yourselves
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.560]   had a better possession and an abiding one."
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.400]   You see the situation?
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.160]   Some Christians had been arrested and put in jail.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.920]   The other believers were facing a moral dilemma.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.360]   Do we go underground, pray for them,
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.200]   or do we express our solidarity with them
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.680]   and risk losing our homes?
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.960]   And the text says that their joy
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.680]   in God's reward overflowed in love.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.880]   Here's what they did,
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.320]   if I can reconstruct the situation.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.440]   They looked at their own lives
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.800]   and quoted to themselves Psalm 63.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.360]   "The steadfast love of the Lord is better than life."
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.120]   And they looked at their houses
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.560]   with all of their furniture
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.000]   passed down from their grandmother,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.880]   their precious vases,
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.760]   and they said to themselves,
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.920]   "We have a possession in heaven
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.840]   that is better and longer lasting than any of this.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.040]   Let goods and kindred go,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.000]   this mortal life also,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.600]   the body they may kill.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.520]   God's truth abideth still,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.000]   his kingdom is forever."
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.320]   And they went with Jesus to the jail
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.400]   and they lost their possessions.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.600]   And what does it say?
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.000]   "They felt as they went, joy."
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.760]   Christian hedonists, through and through,
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.040]   they knew where their treasure was
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.520]   and they didn't have to act
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.880]   according to any sterile sense of duty.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.000]   They just glutted themselves on the joy of love.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.080]   - Such a key point in a key sermon in the Piper Archive.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.600]   It's titled "The Labor of Christian Hedonism"
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.200]   preached on October 2nd, 1983.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.160]   It was part of a series
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.400]   in which Pastor John outlined Christian hedonism,
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.880]   a series that would eventually become the book,
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.480]   "Desiring God."
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.400]   It also happens to be the only mention
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.080]   that I can find in any of his sermons
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.680]   to the topic of inflation.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.040]   That's how I found it originally.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.080]   I was looking for what he had said on that
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.080]   and you heard it in his contemporary paraphrase
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.960]   of Matthew 6, verses 19 to 20,
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.800]   where he said,
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.040]   "Quit being satisfied with little five and a quarter percent
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.920]   yields of pleasure that get eaten up
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.920]   by the moths of inflation and the rust of death.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.560]   Invest in the blue chip high yield
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.200]   divinely insured securities of heaven."
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.520]   So good, I love that line.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.200]   So relevant for us today in this age of inflation.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   Well, I found this clip.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.640]   If you find one, email it to me.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.760]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.760]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.120]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.480]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.000]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.240]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.280]   Well, did Paul say that Christians
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.480]   no longer have evil desires inside?
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.840]   You might get that impression from Colossians 3,
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.560]   and it's a text we need to think more about
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.280]   because we have some really good questions
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.520]   from a listener named Mary.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.120]   Mary puts on a clinic for us
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.400]   in how to write an articulate, specific, hard question
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   via email to us, and with it, we will end the week.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.920]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.200]   and we'll be back with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.160]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:36.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
