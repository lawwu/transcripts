[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   Now they live in Punta Gorda, Florida, where they cruise on their 30-foot
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.440]   trawler, play softball, and collect shells.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.640]   That's a tragedy. Oh my, that is a classic clip from an unforgettable sermon preached
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.960]   18 years ago today on May 20th, 2000 in Memphis, Tennessee. Pastor John, I know
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.320]   you'll never forget that moment. You were preaching outside to about 40,000
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.240]   college students at the Fourth Passion Conference, which was then called One Day.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.000]   It became, of course, one of your most influential sermons. There you introduced
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.200]   us to the world of Bob and Penny and their seashell collection, and then you
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.360]   pleaded with the students, "Don't waste your life." And that plea, of course, would
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.240]   become the title of your book, released in 2003, which has since become a
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.760]   best-selling book that has now sold over 650,000 copies and has really become a
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.640]   staple graduation gift handed out to thousands of high school and college
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.000]   graduates. You know, reflecting back 18 years to that message in Memphis, what do
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   you remember from One Day 2000? Did the message seem particularly different to
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.200]   you? What was your experience of it? What has surprised you about the message now
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.800]   looking back on it? And if I can fit one more question into this episode, I
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.960]   mean, when you think of "Don't waste your life," it's so different from your other
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.360]   books. How do you think of it in the corpus of your other writings?
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:42.080]   Whoa, that's a lot of questions. As I've been thinking about these questions,
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.920]   here's what has come to my mind, and so I'll address some of them, maybe not all
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.720]   of them. I've been thinking about some ironies of the book and that day, and
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.720]   so let me talk about several of these ironies that might get at some of
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.160]   what you're asking. Number one, I think this is the only book where Bob Dylan
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.840]   figures in, in a pretty early significant way. And my point back in 2003 was that
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.120]   his song, "The Answer My Friend Is Blowing In The Wind," really did say "the
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.280]   answer." It didn't say "an answer," it didn't say "lots of answers," it didn't say
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.480]   "possible answers." It said "the answer." "The answer is blowing in the wind." Now,
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:46.120]   today, 50 years later, how ironic is it that the help that John Piper got from
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.240]   believing that there was "the answer" blowing in the wind that I desperately
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.800]   wanted to find for the meaning of my life so that I wouldn't waste my life. I
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.240]   wanted "the answer," not five possible answers or not dreamy answers. I wanted
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:11.040]   "real," "the real answer." How ironic is it that 50 years later, Bob Dylan wins the
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:20.680]   Nobel Prize for literature in 2016 and says in his acceptance speech, which I
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:29.120]   listened to and read twice to make sure I heard it, sadly, was, "So what does it all
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.400]   mean?" You know, looking back over the corpus of his works, "What does it all
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.200]   mean?" And then he answered like this, direct quote, "My songs can mean a lot of
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.600]   things, a lot of different things. If the song moves you, that's all that's
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.120]   important. I don't have to know what all this means, and I'm not gonna worry about
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.920]   it, what it all means." My heart absolutely sank. That's exactly the opposite of what
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.280]   I wrote my book about. It doesn't matter what it all means. You can just let your
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.160]   life mean anything. A thousand ways to waste your life. I don't want to
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.160]   come to the end of my life or my readers to come to the end of their lives and
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.360]   say, "Well, it doesn't really matter what it all means, wasted or not wasted. It
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.800]   doesn't really matter. What matters is how you feel about my songs or about my
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.240]   book." A tragic thing for a 76-year-old human being to say getting ready to
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.840]   meet the living God. I wrote "Don't Waste Your Life" to take people in exactly the
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.360]   opposite direction. How not to come to the end of your life and say like that
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.520]   old man did sitting on the front pew in my father's evangelistic crusade after he
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.160]   had pled with him to receive Christ, put his face in his hands and said as an old
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.580]   man, "I've wasted it. I've wasted it." I can remember my dad telling that story over
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.840]   and over and everything in me as a kid. I don't want that to happen to me. I do not
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.200]   want that to happen to me. Now here's another irony. That sermon 18
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.280]   years ago on that big field in Memphis to those thousands of students was
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   really an exposition and an application of Galatians 6.14. And the irony is that
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.680]   hardly anybody knows that. I think. I mean, if you ask people, "What do you
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.040]   remember from the sermon?" They say, "Shell collecting." And what struck
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.760]   people was the certain illustrations that I used, and I'm not sure how many
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:55.560]   people who were deeply moved by this sermon could remember that this
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.120]   was an exposition of these words, "Far be it from me to boast except in the cross
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.480]   of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me and I to
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.880]   the world." And I remember leading up to this sermon thinking, "I just want to know
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.920]   what that means." So I can tell these students what that means, because Paul is
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:25.320]   saying, "Don't boast in anything except the cross." And I thought, "Are you kidding me?"
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:32.000]   I mean, Paul himself boasts in other things besides the cross, doesn't he? He
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.480]   boasts in his converts, he boasts in sufferings, that word "boast" or "exalt," he
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:46.080]   uses all over the place for other things beside the cross, it seems. And so I
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.560]   worked and worked and worked to try to figure out what does he mean.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:57.600]   And here's what I argued, which is what nobody remembers, it seems like. I argued,
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:07.000]   as hell-bound, God-belittling sinners, none of us deserves one good thing from
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.760]   God. Not one. Not one millisecond of good health or anything else. And because of
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:23.440]   the cross covering our sin and securing God's everlasting favor for us as
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:30.360]   sinners, every single good thing that comes into our life as part of the
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:37.920]   blessings we will enjoy forever in God's favor was purchased by the cross. And
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.880]   every painful thing that comes into our life that God turns for good was
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.560]   purchased by the cross, and therefore the cross is the foundation and the central
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:55.560]   glory of grace at every moment of our lives. That's my answer to the meaning of
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.960]   Galatians 6:14. And here's my suspicion about this irony that the main
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.800]   point of the sermon is swallowed up by the illustrations. I think that in God's
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.800]   way of working through preaching—preaching solid, biblically faithful,
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:22.200]   carefully argued, clearly explained expositions of rich textual meaning—is
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:32.520]   that this exposition becomes the soil, the preaching soil, in which illustrations
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:39.560]   become credible and powerful in a lasting and substantial way. So it would
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:46.600]   be wrong—I'm trying to comfort myself now—it would be wrong to say in my low
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:53.080]   moments that because the stories in the sermon were remembered and the exegesis
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.560]   wasn't, therefore the exegesis was peripheral. I think that is profoundly
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:06.080]   wrong, mistaken, because I think if a pastor gives himself, after looking at
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.960]   the sermon and thinking, "Oh, it's the stories that are remembered," he gives
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.960]   himself, "We can and we can't," and we count to story, story, story, story, story, and begins
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:19.480]   to marginalize and minimize exposition, those stories will lose their
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:24.400]   credibility. They will lose their power. So there's my answer to that apparent
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:31.360]   irony of that message. Here's another irony. One more. I preached that
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.080]   sermon in Memphis to, what, 30,000, 40,000? I don't know how many were there. 18 to 25
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:43.360]   year olds? It was very difficult, frankly. The wind was blowing my notes off. I was
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:49.600]   preaching as a one-armed paper hanger, and I was bothered by how many
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.080]   people were milling around, you know, going to the bathroom, and it was very
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:01.400]   distracting. But I did preach it to 18 to 25 year olds, and I think more people in
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:10.920]   the succeeding 15 years, in their 50s and 60s, have thanked me for that book that
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.680]   grew out of that sermon than the 20s have. I think I can say that with
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.600]   pretty serious confidence, that more people in their 50s and 60s have thanked
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.360]   me for that book. And I think the reason is, it's an irony, because I wrote the
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.600]   book for college-age people, hoping that the book would be given as a graduation
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.680]   gift, which I still think is what people should do with it. But I think that
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:39.120]   irony is that the illustration that most people remembered was the contrast
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.720]   between two pairs of people, right? The first pair were two 80-somethings, Ruby
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.160]   Eliason and Laura Edwards, a nurse and a doctor, who had spent their lives serving
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.680]   the poor in Africa in the name of Jesus, and one of them had been single all
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.920]   her life, one of them was married and a widow now. And in their 80s, they were still
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.800]   serving, they're driving a car, and their car's brakes give out, they fly over a
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:11.920]   cliff in Cameroon, and both of them go into heaven and meet Jesus in their 80s
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:18.080]   after a lifetime of serving the poor. And then the other couple was, whatever their
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.600]   names were, you mentioned them, I can't remember their names, these 50-somethings
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.120]   who took their early retirement, moved to Punta Gorda, Florida, which means, by the
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.680]   way, Fat Point, and they devoted themselves to collecting shells and
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.360]   playing softball and riding their 30-foot yacht. And I asked those 30,000
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:45.480]   young people, "Okay, was the death of these two servants of Christ entering heaven in
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.720]   their 80s through a car crash a tragedy? Was that a waste?" And they shouted out,
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:59.640]   "No!" What is a tragedy? I'll tell you what a tragedy is, two healthy 50-somethings
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.960]   wasting their lives collecting shells, that's a tragedy. And that's the sentence
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:10.800]   that everybody remembers, "Shell collecting." Look, Jesus, here's my shell
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:16.360]   collection that I gathered for you in the last 20 years of my God-given life
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:24.560]   not to be wasted on your account. So I suppose it's not so ironic that the book
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:30.960]   not only confronts young people with the plea, "Don't get sucked into the so-called
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.480]   American dream," but also shakes 50-somethings who were just about to
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.840]   step into it, just about to spend the last 20 or 30 years of their lives
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:50.960]   dinking around, and shakes them free from their comfort trance and catapults them,
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.920]   hundreds of them, into something way more significant than collecting shells.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:03.240]   So how does the book fit into the overall Piper corpus? I suppose one way
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:09.440]   to say it would be that virtually everything I write aims to help people
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:16.880]   not waste their lives. But this one, this book, more than any other, cuts to the
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:25.720]   chase, puts the finger on the chest, and says, "Don't do that. Don't waste your life."
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:32.840]   So good. That message 18 years ago, boasting only in the cross, became then
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:37.440]   the best-selling book, "Don't Waste Your Life," which has since sold 650,000 copies,
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.240]   has become a classic graduation present. And I should mention that the book is
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.480]   now out in two brand-new editions in 2018, both with a new preface and new
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.440]   cover designs. The new paperback edition features a simple red cross which is
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.600]   debossed on a kraft paper cover with French flaps to mark your spot in the
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   books. I love those French flaps. And the interior is printed on a cream stock
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.680]   paper with deckled edges. It is really a beautiful design by our friends at
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.320]   Crossway on that paperback. And now the book is also available as a hardcover
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:17.240]   gift edition. It's a red cloth cover in a black slipcase, a really sharp gift
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:22.880]   edition now out. Both are available online now. I'm gonna leave off today's
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.040]   episode with four of the most memorable minutes of that message coming from the
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.640]   introduction, "Boasting Only in the Cross" is the title of the message, and we'll
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:43.800]   see you on Wednesday. Ruby Eliason, over 80, single all her life, a nurse, poured
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:51.680]   her life out for one thing, to make Jesus Christ known among the sick and the poor
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:59.840]   in the hardest and most unreached places. Laura Edwards, a medical doctor in the
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:08.400]   Twin Cities, and then in retirement, partnering up with Ruby, also pushing 80,
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:16.320]   and going from village to village in Cameroon. And the brakes give way, over a
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:26.720]   cliff they go, and they're dead instantly. And I asked my people, "Is this a tragedy?"
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:39.320]   Two women in their 80s, a whole life devoted to one idea, Jesus Christ
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:49.520]   magnified among the poor and the sick in the hardest places, and 20 years after
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:55.160]   most of their American counterparts had begun to throw their lives away on
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:01.680]   trivialities in Florida and New Mexico, fly into eternity with a death in a
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:10.040]   moment. "Is this a tragedy?" I asked. It is not a tragedy. I'll read you what a
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:16.640]   tragedy is. I've got a little article here from Reader's Digest. You don't read
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:24.840]   Reader's Digest, I know that, but there is a generation who does. This is a tragedy.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:36.000]   Title of the article, "Start Now, Retire Early." February 1998. Bob and Penny took
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.880]   early retirement from their jobs in the Northeast five years ago when he was 59
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:50.320]   and she was 51. Now they live in Punta Gorda, Florida, where they cruise on their
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:17:06.080]   30-foot trawler, play softball, and collect shells. That's a tragedy. That's a
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:11.120]   tragedy and there are people in this country that are spending billions of
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:20.600]   dollars to get you to buy it. And I get 40 minutes to plead with you, "Don't buy
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:31.080]   it." With all my heart, I plead with you, "Don't buy that dream." The American dream.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:42.520]   A nice house, a nice car, a nice job, a nice family, a nice retirement, collecting
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:51.680]   shells. As the last chapter before you stand before the Creator of the universe
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:18:02.160]   to give an account with what you did, "Here it is, Lord, my shell collection. Look,
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:16.200]   Lord, my shell collection. And I've got a good swing. And look at my boat. God, look
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:28.240]   at my boat, God." Well, not for Ruby and not for Laura. Don't waste your life.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.800]   Don't waste it.
