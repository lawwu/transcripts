[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.520]   - Happy Friday, everyone.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.040]   Well, can we make ourselves more holy
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.240]   if we treat our bodies more harshly?
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.400]   It's a great question from a listener
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.800]   named Garrett in Houston, Texas.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.640]   Pastor John, hello, I've recently been studying
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.240]   the life of St. Anthony through a book by Athanasius.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.440]   I'm curious about your thoughts on asceticism,
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.200]   a practice of many Christians throughout the church age.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.120]   Is this a biblical way to live and pursue holiness?
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.440]   Does it work?
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.240]   Is it biblical to hold such a rigid self-discipline?
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.520]   I ask because of Colossians 2, verse 23,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.640]   where Paul defines asceticism as severity to the body
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.480]   and that practice being of no value
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.840]   in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.440]   So what are your thoughts on the place of asceticism
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.960]   in the Christian life today?
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.120]   - When Garrett says, "Is it biblical
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.240]   "to hold such rigid self-discipline?"
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.680]   I don't know what the word such refers to
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.800]   because I'm not familiar enough
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.600]   with the life of St. Anthony
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.760]   to pass judgment on his pattern of asceticism.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.440]   So let me just speak more generally,
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.160]   especially from the text of Colossians,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.640]   'cause I think that's what he's really getting at,
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.400]   is there a legitimate place for severity to the body
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.920]   called asceticism?
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.840]   Whenever we hear the Apostle Paul criticizing some teaching
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.120]   or warning against some practice,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.400]   we have to kind of piece together
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.560]   from what he says what the false teachers are saying,
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.960]   like listening to one end of the phone conversation.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.360]   That's what we're up against in Colossians.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.120]   There was some kind of false teaching going on
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.800]   that Paul was very concerned about,
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.120]   and it involved some kind of asceticism,
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.640]   some kind of severity to the body.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.960]   It seemed to involve special visions,
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.000]   worship of angels, he mentions,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.320]   the insistence upon certain religious holy days,
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   days, months, and it seems that there are a cluster
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.400]   of very basic rules, elemental principles, he calls them,
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.760]   being forced upon the church
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.760]   so that if you don't follow these ascetic rules
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.640]   about food and drink and days and visions and angels,
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.520]   you're not a Christian.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.160]   Now, Paul's main criticism of what was happening
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.240]   is that it diminished Christ.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.320]   Christ, the all-supplying head of the church,
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.880]   Christ as the creator of the world,
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.880]   Christ, the one who upholds all things,
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.000]   Christ supreme over all things.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.760]   The whole system of this false teaching
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.000]   was diminishing Christ in all those ways.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.680]   So let me read some texts,
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.000]   and let's listen for those kinds of false teachings.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.720]   First, Colossians 2:8,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.680]   "See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.640]   and empty deceit according to human tradition,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.840]   according to elemental principles of the world,
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.240]   not according to Christ."
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   Now, we'll see what those elemental principles are
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.000]   in just a moment, but notice the problem here
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   is that these merely human traditions
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.120]   and these basic religious elemental principles
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.800]   are replacing Christ.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.240]   It says, "Not holding fast to Christ,
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.720]   not exalting Christ,
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.920]   not living according to Christ."
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.000]   Now, verses 16 to 19,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   "Let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.960]   and drink with regard to a festival or a new moon
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.520]   or Sabbath.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.240]   These are a shadow of things to come,
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.800]   but the substance belongs to Christ,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.560]   like a body casting a shadow,
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.680]   and Christ is the body, and the shadow is all those things
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.720]   that are being exalted above Christ.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.720]   Let no one disqualify you insisting on asceticism
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.360]   and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions,
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.760]   puffed up," there's the problem underneath this,
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.840]   "puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind,
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.720]   not holding fast to the head."
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.760]   So again, we see that the issue
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.840]   is not holding fast to Christ.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.240]   What he's being replaced with is food, drink,
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.000]   festival, new moon, Sabbath,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.240]   and since asceticism is mentioned,
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.120]   probably the reference to food and drink means
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.720]   don't eat them, don't drink them,
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.200]   rather than you must eat them or you must drink them.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.760]   Either way, the elemental rules
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.160]   are replacing the way of Christ.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.440]   Then one more text, verses 20 following.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.600]   "If with Christ you died to the elemental principles
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   of the world, why, as if you were still alive in the world,
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.840]   do you submit to regulations?"
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.320]   And I think these are the elemental principles
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.160]   he's concerned about.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.320]   "Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch,
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.000]   referring to things that all perish when used
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.320]   according to human precepts and teachings.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.640]   These indeed have an appearance of wisdom
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.160]   in promoting self-made religion and asceticism
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.920]   and a severity to the body, but they're of no value
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.640]   in stopping the indulgence of the flesh."
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.400]   So there you get something of a picture
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.760]   of the false teaching in Colossae
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.840]   involving worship of angels, visions,
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.480]   severity to the body,
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.640]   by abstaining from certain foods and drinks,
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.720]   keeping certain religious holidays,
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.800]   following these elemental principles and rules.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.480]   "Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch."
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.640]   Twice we've heard Paul say that the problem is
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.840]   these are not according to Christ.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.440]   You are not holding fast to the head.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.200]   And all the other defects with this false teaching
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.680]   about asceticism and severity to the body,
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.000]   all of them are of no value
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.840]   in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.840]   So this false teaching at Colossae is failing in two ways.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.040]   One, it isn't glorifying Christ,
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.160]   and two, it isn't defeating sin.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.240]   It's producing puffed up Christians
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.640]   and it is diminishing Christ.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.800]   So here's the issue with asceticism.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.960]   Asceticism has a legitimate place in the Christian life
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.640]   as does the thankful enjoyment of food
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.440]   and drink that God gives us.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.680]   Eating and drinking can become gluttony
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.280]   with a loss of self-control,
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.760]   and not eating and drinking can become boastful
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.720]   and Christ diminishing.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.920]   That was happening at Colossae.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.360]   So the question is not simply,
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.840]   do you eat or don't you eat?
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.480]   Do you drink or don't you drink?
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.640]   Do you sleep or don't you sleep?
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.040]   Do you deny yourself certain legitimate pleasures
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.040]   or don't you?
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.360]   That's not the main question.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.360]   The main questions are, is Christ being exalted
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.280]   or is self being exalted?
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.680]   While crucifying the sin of gluttony,
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.440]   are you feeding the sin of pride?
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.440]   Is asceticism killing sin or feeding sin?
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.520]   Those are the key questions.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.840]   We can't just say that asceticism is bad
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.560]   because the false teachers at Colossae were using it
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.720]   because Paul himself and Jesus taught
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.560]   that we should make sure by self-denial
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.920]   that we are not being enslaved by any good thing.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.080]   For example, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9.25,
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.320]   "Every athlete exercises self-control.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.920]   I do not run aimlessly.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.560]   I do not box as one beating the air.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.720]   I discipline my body and keep it under control
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.160]   lest after preaching to others,
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.720]   I myself should be disqualified."
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.880]   And the word discipline there means
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.320]   give my body a black eye.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.320]   I mean, it's a pretty strong word, sometimes translated,
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.040]   I palm on my body.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.400]   In other words, Paul is hard on his body
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.960]   when he needs to be hard on his body
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.400]   in order to protect himself against sin and unbelief.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.000]   And then in 1 Corinthians 6.12, he said,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.560]   "All things are lawful for me,
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.800]   but I will not be dominated or controlled
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.560]   or enslaved by anything."
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.600]   In other words, the issue is not that food and drink
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   or other legitimate pleasures are sinful,
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.800]   but that we ought not to be enslaved or dominated
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.920]   or controlled by anything, good or evil.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.480]   Part of the strategy by which we discern
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.840]   whether we are enslaved is self-denial,
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.360]   called asceticism, if you wish.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.520]   And so Jesus said, "If anyone would come after me,
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.560]   let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.560]   In other words, we dare not treat all asceticism as bad.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:47.680]   And of course, we should not treat God's good gifts
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.440]   of food and drink and friendship and marriage
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.640]   and hundreds of other delights in this life.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.000]   We should not treat God's gifts as evil.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.520]   Paul was probably warning against
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.440]   the same false teaching of Colossae
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.000]   when he wrote in 1 Timothy 4.4,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.720]   "Everything created by God is good.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.880]   Nothing is to be rejected
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.560]   if it is received with thanksgiving,
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.640]   for it is made holy by the word of God in prayer."
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.400]   So one way to sum up things would be to say,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.840]   one, we will glorify Christ
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.040]   if we receive his good gifts with thankfulness,
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.000]   which shows that he's the good and generous Savior.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.680]   And two, we will glorify Christ
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.360]   by strategically denying ourselves some of his good gifts
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.680]   in order to show that he and not his gifts
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.000]   are our greatest treasure.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.200]   And the problem of the false teaching at Colossae
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.000]   was that severity to the body
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.400]   was being put into elemental principles or rules
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.640]   that instead of exalting the worth and beauty
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.200]   and grace of Christ,
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.520]   were feeding the ego of the ascetics.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.520]   This calls for great wisdom and insight into our own hearts.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.960]   So two guidelines to close.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.960]   One, enjoy God's good gifts with thankfulness
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.920]   to make much of him and his grace and his generosity.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.920]   And two, deny yourself in order to defeat sinful bondage
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.000]   and show that the giver is more precious to you
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.040]   than the gift.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.400]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.080]   And great Bible question, Garrett.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.600]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.520]   search on Growing Archive or subscribe to the podcast,
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.560]   all at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.240]   We're gonna break for the weekend and return on Monday
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.080]   with an honest and pretty raw email from a hurting man,
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.480]   a hurting dad.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.240]   He's sad over the brokenness of the world
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.520]   and he wants to know why, if God is in charge,
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.400]   sovereignly in charge of this world,
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.400]   why then is there so much suffering and violence and pain
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.440]   in our world, our nation, our cities,
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.360]   and in our own families?
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.800]   It's a really sobering email to read,
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.480]   but that is the topic on Monday.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.960]   Next time, I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.120]   and we'll see you then.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:30.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
