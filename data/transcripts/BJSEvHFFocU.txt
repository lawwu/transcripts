[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor John Piper.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.840]   Here's today's question for you.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.040]   "Hello Pastor John, my name is Darmo and I live in Indonesia.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.600]   What encouragement would you give for us who have read and admired Eugene Peterson's books
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.880]   over the years in light of his recent admission that he would marry a gay couple?
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.760]   He seems to have recanted on this position, but it still leaves in my mind a lingering
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.760]   question.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.160]   When it comes to national or international voices in the church, when do they lose their
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.520]   platform?
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.400]   If an evangelical wavers on same-sex marriage, to what extent are their life's works valuable
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.100]   or not to the church in the future, both in private use and in public commendation?"
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.280]   What would you say, Pastor John, to Darmo?
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.080]   Let me try to say something about this question without focusing too much on Eugene Peterson.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:15.000]   It's a bigger issue than one man, but I will say that I was really sad to read his seemingly
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.280]   cavalier endorsement of so-called same-sex marriage and then how, in my mind, unsatisfying
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.800]   his retraction was.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.560]   Perhaps I wasn't as surprised as some that he would move in that direction, but when
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.720]   he did, at least for a moment, it was a tragic development.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.740]   And I say that, I say it was tragic, because endorsing so-called same-sex marriage involves
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.880]   three tragic things.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.600]   One, it involves a false and destructive view of marriage.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.600]   Two, it involves a false and destructive view of sexuality.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.400]   And three, and most important, probably, it involves a false and destructive view of the
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:18.480]   gospel warning that those who live in unrepentant homosexual activity will not inherit the kingdom
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.160]   of God, and the gospel of Jesus is given precisely to rescue us from that peril.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.280]   So why would we send people into it if we are gospel people?
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:41.240]   So to me, these three false and deeply destructive errors are so serious that it's almost inconceivable
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.800]   to me that a serious Christian would not be prevented by biblical faithfulness and love
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.160]   for people's eternal good from endorsing so-called same-sex marriage.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.960]   So the question for me becomes, in general, what shall we do with books and sermons of
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.240]   those who, somewhere along the way, depart from biblical faithfulness in these and other
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.240]   serious ways?
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.960]   So I've just got four observations that I'll make, and I hope they provide some guidance
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.000]   to us as we reflect on them.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.720]   Number one, in principle, a book that was once properly seen as true and helpful may
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.640]   remain true and helpful, even if its author says things that are seriously untrue and
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.720]   unhelpful later on.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.240]   The simplest way to show this, that this is true, is to notice that King Solomon was the
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.000]   author of many of the proverbs—Proverbs 1:1, the proverbs of Solomon, son of David,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.920]   king of Israel—and he was the author of the Song of Songs, Song of Solomon 1:1.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.840]   And yet, here's what we read in 1 Kings 11, "When Solomon was old, his wives turned away
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.880]   his heart after other gods, and his heart was not wholly true to the Lord his God, as
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.680]   was the heart of David his father.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.760]   For Solomon went after the Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom,
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.160]   the abomination of the Ammonites.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.560]   So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the Lord."
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.460]   So I conclude that in principle, a book can remain true and helpful, even if its author
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.280]   goes off the rails.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.700]   Number two, second observation.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:45.940]   If a writer does move in a seriously defective direction, doctrinally or morally, we have
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:56.080]   good reason to reread what he has written and be on the lookout for the seeds and trajectories
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.640]   that might give some explanation for why he went in such a wrong direction.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:10.420]   In retrospect, we might discover in his writings things which, in fact, we had overlooked.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.720]   We had given him the benefit of the doubt, perhaps, and now we see, hmm, maybe not.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:23.040]   Those things carried maybe the seeds of the defection or the trajectory of the defection
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.440]   in the end.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:31.380]   So we might judge that the writings are not as helpful as we once thought they were on
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.480]   a more careful reading.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.400]   Here's the third thing I would say.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.240]   In what I said under number one, I used the phrase "in principle."
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.000]   In principle, a book that was once properly seen as true and helpful may remain true and
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.520]   helpful.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.760]   The reason I use the phrase "in principle" is to distinguish it from inactuality.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:02.800]   In other words, a book never does exist in principle alone, in abstract.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:11.360]   It never exists isolated from connections with author, real and potential readers, churches,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.760]   publisher, ministry, the fruit it bears, time in history when it served its purpose.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:28.980]   And the point here is that the decision what to do with a book isn't based on the principal
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:36.180]   legitimacy of what it says alone, but also on its connections with people and churches
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:44.020]   and ministries and publishers and times, any of which might be very helpful or very harmful
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:51.620]   by their connections with the book, or very harmed or helped by their connection with
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.060]   the book.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:03.300]   And we need to weigh the issue of what our promotion or endorsement of a book may do
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.700]   in all of those connections.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:11.420]   I'm thinking of the biblical principle of not causing your brother to stumble, because
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:17.660]   even in principle, you may have freedom to do something, but in other factors, when they're
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:25.660]   drawn in, may make that very act an unloving act, 1 Corinthians 8, Romans 14.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:32.120]   And the last thing, the fourth thing I would say, is that it seems to me that one lesson
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:40.020]   we should learn from these repeated situations that happen in history is that excessive,
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:49.140]   uncritical praise for an ordinary human author—and here, I'm not thinking of inspired biblical
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.140]   authors in any of these.
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:58.380]   I think God, in his mercy and inspiration, has protected those authors, even though they
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.940]   are fallen human beings, from writing what is false.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.840]   That's what we mean by inspiration.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:11.080]   So I'm not including them in this when I say uncritical praise of an ordinary human author
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:18.480]   is probably unwarranted and may do harm, even though we have been tremendously helped by
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.040]   the person we're praising.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:26.620]   For example, I can hear excessive praise for St. Augustine or John Calvin or Martin Luther
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.000]   or Karl Barth or my favorite, C.S.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.440]   Lewis, Jonathan Edwards, John Owen.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:43.240]   We would probably do well to regularly remind ourselves and our audiences that all authors
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:51.560]   have feet of clay and that every book should be read through the discerning lens of biblical
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.460]   faithfulness.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:59.040]   So bottom line, test all things and hold fast to what is good.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:05.400]   Man, this is very wise and good and insightful, and I think we can apply this to all of our
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.400]   favorite writers.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:13.000]   I love that line, "Uncritical praise of an ordinary human author is probably unwarranted."
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.060]   Amen.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.060]   So well said.
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.360]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening and making the podcast part of your
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.960]   day and your commute.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.240]   It's really an honor to join you as part of your very busy day as you drive around.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.000]   I know a lot of you listen in the car.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.360]   Three times a week we publish, and you can subscribe to our audio feeds and keep up with
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   our new episodes and even search our past episodes in our archive and even reach us
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.880]   by email with a question you may be facing about life, like this very good one from Darmo.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.640]   You can do all that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:50.240]   Well, speaking of really good questions, we know that God is sovereign.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.800]   He can do whatever He wants to whenever He wants to.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.160]   He has that kind of power, and I think most of us agree with that.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:04.560]   But does that also mean that God controls all things all the time?
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.240]   That is a really sharp question, and it comes from a listener in Jacksonville, Florida,
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.080]   and it's up on Friday.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.440]   [END]
