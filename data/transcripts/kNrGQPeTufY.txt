[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:16.440]   the Gospel according to St. John, in the first chapter, reading verses 12 and 13. Verses
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:26.160]   12 and 13 in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John. "But as many as received
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:36.800]   him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.920]   which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of men, but
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.440]   of God." Now we've been examining this great statement for a number of Sunday mornings
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.800]   and our approach to it is this. Here we are told that in many ways the main object of
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.680]   the coming of the Son of God into this world was that we might be made the children or
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.440]   the sons of God. The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and that was why. The eternal
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:19.120]   Son became a man in order that we, the sinful sons of men, might be made and become the
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.520]   sons of God. Nothing is more wonderful and glorious than this, and therefore it follows
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.960]   that nothing is more important than that we should all be absolutely certain and assured
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.440]   that we are the children of God. Now that seems to me, as I am trying to indicate, to
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:47.520]   be the great message of the New Testament, and particularly the New Testament epistles.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.440]   They were written in order that people who for various reasons had become a little bit
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.200]   uncertain of their position should be reassured. And indeed there is obvious evidence in this
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.640]   very Gospel of John for saying that he himself wrote his Gospel for that reason. Any doubt
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.240]   about the person of our Lord at once does away with assurance. And in the same way any
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.380]   doubt about our own position in him again does away with assurance. And there is nothing
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.880]   that is so essential to the living of the Christian life and to the manifestation of
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.160]   the glory of the Christian way of salvation as assurance. If the trumpet yield an uncertain
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.240]   sound, says Paul, who shall prepare him for the battle? A church which doesn't know
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.920]   what he believes is a travesty of the name of church. And that's why things are as
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.880]   they are today, because of this uncertainty. But equally it is possible for you to hold
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.240]   the right doctrine, the right views, but to be uncertain about yourself and about your
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:04.520]   relationship to it. And again that paralyzes also. The Christian is not meant to be an
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.440]   advocate, he is meant to be a witness. "Ye shall be witnesses unto me," says our Lord.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.600]   And every one of us is meant to be a witness. People are in trouble in the world today and
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.120]   they won't listen to us if we are merely giving them some theoretical position. But
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.640]   if we can say with the apostle Paul, "I am persuaded that neither death nor life,
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.680]   nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.200]   height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate me from the love
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.400]   of God which is in Christ Jesus," they'll begin to listen. If we can turn to them and
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.840]   say, "I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.360]   I have committed unto him against that day," they'll begin to listen. Assurance is essential,
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.360]   not only for our own happiness, but for our own usefulness. Now that's why we are examining
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.080]   this. It isn't enough that we recognize that the gospel says that "whosoever received
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.960]   him to them gave he power to become the sons of God." The question is, do we know that
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.440]   we are the children of God? Now that's what we are examining. And there are many, many
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.880]   tests. And I am trying to indicate this, that if you find a little of all of them in you,
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.720]   well, you can be quite happy about yourself. If you find any one of them very powerfully,
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.400]   again, I would say you're all right. But we are meant to know something about all these
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.760]   tests, every one of them. That's why we are going through them in detail.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.160]   Now we've divided it up like this, our relationship to the Son, our relationship to the Father,
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.120]   our relationship to the Holy Spirit. And that's what we are dealing with now. The moment we
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.160]   become children of God, we are related to the Holy Spirit. And we are looking at the
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.040]   ways in which we can be sure of this. And the particular matter that's before us at
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:15.280]   the moment is this. We are told by the Apostle Paul in Romans 8, 14, "As many as are being
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:25.080]   led by the Spirit of God, they are the children of God." It's an absolute proof. Any man
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.680]   who's led by the Spirit of God, he's a child of God. The man who's not a Christian is not
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.480]   being led by the Spirit of God. Very well. So what we are examining is, how do we know
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:45.080]   that we are being led by the Spirit of God? And we've seen a number of things which are
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:52.240]   inevitably true when we are led by the Spirit of God.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.120]   And we are now looking in particular at what he does, what he leads us to, in this particular
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.880]   matter of daily life and conduct and behavior. We have seen that he causes us to examine
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.440]   ourselves, that he creates within us breathings and longings and hungering and thirsting after
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.360]   righteousness. I said last Sunday morning that this is a very good test. If you are
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.520]   more concerned about being holy than you are about being happy, you're a Christian, beyond
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.840]   any doubt. It's only true of a Christian. But if you are more concerned about being
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.200]   happy than being holy, it becomes doubtful again.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.280]   And then we went on to consider the increasing sensitiveness of the Christian to the very
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:48.800]   approach of sin. But now we haven't quite finished this matter of the leading of the
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.120]   Spirit. We've seen that he leads to the Scriptures, he leads to prayer, and so on.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.560]   But there's one big subject which we still must, needs, deal with under this heading
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:07.080]   of the leading of the Spirit. And that is none other than what is called the mortification
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.760]   of sin, or the mortification of the flesh.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.040]   Now then, let me give my authority for saying that. The first is again in the epistle to
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:29.840]   the Romans in chapter 8, and in verses 12 and 13. "Therefore, brethren, we are debtors,
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:36.680]   not to the flesh to live after the flesh. For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die;
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:45.720]   but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live." Notice
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:55.520]   the terms, "if ye by or through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.120]   live." Then the parallel statement of the same doctrine is to be found in the epistle
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:09.080]   to the Colossians, in the third chapter and the fourth verse and following. "Mortify
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:15.280]   therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, inordinate
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.400]   affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness which is idolatry; for which things sake the
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.640]   wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience, in the which ye also walked some time when
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:37.280]   ye lived in them." And so on. Mortify. The deeds of the body, mortify your members which
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:45.200]   are on the earth. Now, here I say is a very vital and essential
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:53.280]   part of the work of the leading of the Spirit. The leading of the Spirit, as we saw at the
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:09:01.680]   end last Sunday morning, obviously and of necessity, must lead to an increasing hatred
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:13.800]   of sin. The Spirit is the Holy Spirit. He is the exact opposite of sin in every respect.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.720]   And therefore I say that it follows, it needs no demonstration, that a man who is under
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:25.440]   the control and the leading of the Spirit is one who will develop an increasing hatred
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:32.320]   of sin. And that in turn will lead to his doing something about it. You can't hate
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:38.640]   sin theoretically. You begin to do something about it if you really hate it. "Ye that
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.680]   love the Lord," says the psalmist, "hate evil." Hate it.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.120]   Now this is something which is of course emphasized everywhere, right through the whole of the
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:56.800]   New Testament. Now, what we must emphasize as we approach this subject this morning is
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:06.320]   this. It is something, you notice, which you and I are called upon to do. It is not something
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:12.040]   that is done for us. Now I put it like that because there is a well-known and popular
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.200]   teaching which tells us that the way of sanctification is to do nothing. It's all to be done for
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.560]   us. Look to the Lord, he'll do it for you. He'll fight your battles for you. But here
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:28.640]   is a definite instruction. If you, through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body,
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:34.440]   you shall live. But you've got to do it. "Mortify therefore your members which are
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.880]   upon the earth." It doesn't say, "Hand yourself and all over and it'll be done
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:44.360]   for you." It says, "No, you've got to do it." And this is of course absolutely
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.920]   vital and essential. This whole doctrine of the mortification of the body and the mortification
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:56.760]   of sin and of the flesh is a doctrine that one very rarely hears these days. It's almost
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:03.400]   gone right out. And yet there were days and times when it was one of the most prominent
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.720]   doctrines in Christian preaching and in the life of the Church. And here it is before
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.600]   us in the Scripture, and in various shapes and forms. I say it's everywhere in these
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:20.720]   New Testament epistles. There is no passivity taught in the New Testament. It's a commandment.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:28.360]   It is something that you and I have to do. Indeed, we can put it like this. The Spirit
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:38.000]   leads us to do it, and at the same time he gives us the power to do it. If ye, through
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.560]   the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body. Now there's the perfect balance. I've got
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:50.960]   to do it, yes, but the Spirit enables me to do it. I can't do it myself. That is where
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:58.960]   the whole notion of monasticism broke down. Let us say this for the notion of monasticism.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.840]   The fundamental idea behind it was in many ways right, at least it was right in its origin
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:11.440]   in this way. That these were people who realized that as Christians they must no longer go
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:18.360]   on living the life that they've lived before in the world. They realized that holiness
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.440]   is something which is taken very seriously in the New Testament. That you don't just
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.200]   say, "Thank God I'm a Christian, and then it doesn't matter what I do." They took this
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:33.560]   very seriously and rightly. They said something has got to be done about this. They found
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.840]   that in the world, the body and the world and the flesh and so on, and the devil were
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:45.360]   there and they were failing. So they said, "We must do something about this." And what
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.920]   they decided to do, you remember, was to segregate themselves, to go out to the world and to
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.960]   live in communities. Sometimes they'd live as hermits entirely on their own, and they'd
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.040]   fast in a rigorous manner, and they would clothe themselves with camel hair shirts and
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:05.520]   things like that, and do violence to the body. That was their idea of mortifying the body
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:12.480]   or mortifying their members that are on the earth. Now I say the fallacy there is this,
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.120]   that they were doing it in their own strength. They were doing it by taking this drastic
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:25.080]   action. And that seems to me to be almost the opposite of, "If ye through the Spirit
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:32.040]   do mortify the deeds of the body." Let us pay tribute, I say, to their desire. They
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.040]   were prepared to forego all worldly pleasures and worldly prospects, to forsake all that
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:43.280]   the world has got to give, and to become what they called religious, exclusively in that
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:49.840]   way. But the tragedy was, of course, that it didn't work. It didn't succeed. You don't
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.520]   get rid of the world by taking yourself physically out of it. You can take the world with you
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:59.440]   in your mind. And they found that even in their lonely cells and in the lonely caves
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.360]   on top of the mountain, the imagination was still there. The desires were still there.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.960]   That isn't the way to do it. But if the right way to do it is to do it through the
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:17.680]   Spirit. The Spirit gives the power. He gives this enabling. He's been given to us for
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:24.440]   that reason. That's why we are given the Spirit. Because in and of ourselves we are
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:31.720]   incapable, but he gives us the power. And then it is for us, by the power provided,
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.600]   to put this into practice. I believe I once used this illustration. It comes to me, and
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.640]   I can't think of a better one at the moment. Do you remember the man with the withered
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:47.400]   hand who was healed by our Lord? There was a man who'd been incapable of moving that
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:52.440]   arm and hand at all. It was lying helpless at his side. He'd often tried to move it,
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:59.040]   but he couldn't move it. And do you remember our Lord's method in healing him? At first
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:04.240]   it sounds quite ridiculous. Our Lord says to a man who's got a paralyzed arm, "Stretch
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:11.600]   forth thine hand." But how can a man who's paralyzed obey such a command? How can a man
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:17.200]   whose essential trouble is paralysis stretch forth his hand? But that's what our Lord said
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.320]   to him. And the man did it. In other words, as the Lord gave the command, he gave the
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:28.960]   power. But the man had to take his action. The man stretched forth his hand, but the
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:37.640]   power to do so was given to him by our blessed Lord and Savior. Well, here it is. "If ye
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:44.040]   do not do so through the Spirit, ye don't just become passive and leave it all to him."
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.600]   No, no. You've got to do something. You've got to mortify the deeds of the body, the
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:57.120]   members that are yet upon the earth. Very well. How is this done? And again, there is
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:03.600]   an abundance of teaching with regard to this. It's astounding to notice the wealth of teaching.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:09.120]   How people can apparently be blind to it and not see it at all, and say, "Let go, let
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.360]   God, you've got nothing to do at all, he does it all for you." And yet here's the
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:18.560]   New Testament full of instructions as to what we are to do with the enabling that is given
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:30.400]   to us by the Holy Spirit. Well, let's take it negatively first. "You are no longer debtors
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.040]   to the flesh to live after the flesh," says the apostle. "For if you do that, you shall
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:43.160]   die. But if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live." What's
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.880]   it mean? How am I to mortify my members that are on the earth? And by that he means this,
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:56.000]   that though we are Christians, we are still in the body. And sin makes use of the body,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.960]   tends to reside in the body. And that is the trouble that we all find, these members that
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.160]   are still on the earth. You see, spiritually I'm in heaven, I'm seated in the heavenly
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.980]   places in Christ Jesus. Yes, but my members are still on the earth. I'm living a life
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:17.840]   in the flesh still. The life I live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God,
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:22.680]   who loved me and gave himself for me. Now, what am I to do about all this? Well, the
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:30.280]   teaching seems to me to be this. We've got to realize the true nature and character of
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:40.520]   sin. It's absolutely essential. I know I say sin and not sins. Of course, we've got to
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:46.480]   deal with particular sins. But I feel more and more that if we concentrate only on particular
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:53.480]   sins instead of looking at sin as a whole, we'll go astray. We've got to realize the
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.760]   character of sin, and the Bible is full of such teaching. It gives it us in the book
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:04.840]   of Genesis, and it goes on. The moment a man realizes the exceeding sinfulness of sin,
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:11.280]   he's on the highway to modifying the deeds of the body. Very well, that's the most important
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:22.040]   thing. Sin and God are eternal opposites. God hates sin, and you and all your men are
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:27.840]   hated, with all our being. He that loved the Lord hated evil.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:38.480]   Now then, how do we do this in practice? Well, there's no end, almost, to the instructions
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:47.040]   that are given. I've tried to classify them. First, have no fellowship with the unfruitful
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:54.040]   works of darkness. We read that just now in the fifth chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:01.440]   verses 11 and 12. You see, you start by realizing that the works of darkness are utterly unfruitful.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:10.040]   There's no value in them. There's no profit in them. If only we could see that, my friends.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   Why do Christian people live as near as they can to the world? Why do they want to play
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:20.360]   with sin? They don't realize it's unfruitful. It's useless. It's a waste of energy. There's
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.160]   nothing in it. So the apostle says, have no fellowship with
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:34.080]   it. Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness. They're unfruitful, and
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:39.440]   they belong to the realm of darkness. God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:45.520]   Very well. Don't touch them. Have no fellowship with them. That's why I read to you that first
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:52.080]   psalm just now. "Blessed is the man, yours the happy men, that walketh not in the counsel
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:58.640]   of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful."
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:05.160]   Where are you walking, my friends? If you are led by the Spirit, you are not walking
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.960]   in the counsel of the ungodly. If you are led by the Spirit, you are not standing in
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:15.120]   the way of sinners. You don't frequent the places where they go, and where you know sin
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:22.200]   is taking place, you don't stand about there. Neither do you sit in the seat of the scornful.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:30.120]   Where do you spend your time? If we are led of the Spirit, it's the opposite of that
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:37.120]   ungodly man and his counsel and his ways. So the apostle says, have no fellowship with
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:43.320]   it. Nothing to do with it. Keep as far away as you can from it.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.680]   There it is in the Old Testament. There I've given it to you in the words of the apostle
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.720]   Paul. Let me give it to you in the words of the apostle Peter, because they all say exactly
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:57.720]   the same thing. There's no difference here. "He that will love life and see good days,"
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:03.560]   what's he got to do? "Let go, let God?" No, no. "Let him refrain his tongue from
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:10.580]   evil, and his lips that they speak no guile, let him eschew evil." Do you know the meaning
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:15.760]   of the word "eschew"? It's a very picturesque word. It's that of a horse being driven along
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.720]   a country lane, and if you know anything about nervous horses, you'll know exactly what
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.720]   I'm saying. You're driving a horse along a country lane or riding him. Suddenly the
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.760]   horse sees just a bit of paper and he shies, jumps to the other side and nearly throws
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:35.200]   you off. Eschew. The moment you see it, you shy away from it. "Let him eschew evil and
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:41.400]   do good. Let him seek peace and ensue it. Let him pursue it." Well, there it is. The
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:48.240]   apostle Peter is equally plain and clear, you see, in the teaching that he also gives
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:55.400]   us. And he goes on saying the same thing right away through, "Forasmuch then as Christ has
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:01.360]   suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind. For he that hath
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.440]   suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin, that he should no longer live the rest of
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:11.760]   his life in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. For the time past
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.200]   of your life may suffice you to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:24.400]   lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banqueting, and abominable idolatry. Wherein
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.880]   they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:35.080]   evil of you." What a contemporary document the New Testament is. They're still doing
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.320]   that, aren't they? But now the point is, we're not to do that. He says, "You've
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.760]   spent enough of your time in doing that sort of thing. Don't go wasting your time any
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.920]   longer. Keep clear of it. Have no fellowship with it at all."
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:56.480]   And then there's a great statement in 1 Thessalonians 5. "Avoid," says the New
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:02.800]   Testament, the authorized version, "Avoid the very appearance of evil," which means,
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:12.200]   "Avoid every appearance of evil. Avoid every form of evil. Don't make any exception.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:19.720]   Evil in any shape or form, avoid it. Have nothing to do with it. Could anything be clearer?"
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:27.280]   So if you do that, you are already on the road to mortifying your members that are on
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:33.920]   the earth. You're mortifying your body. Obviously, if you put yourself in the way
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.400]   of sin, it's not going to be surprising if you find yourself sinning. It's pure
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.800]   common sense, this, the New Testament, is a book that appeals to our common sense.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.960]   It says you're proud of the fact that you're in the light, whereas you were in the dark.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:51.160]   "Very well," it says, "have nothing to do with the unfruitful works of darkness.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:57.160]   Keep clear of it. Don't walk in the way of the ungodly. You know where it'll lead
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:04.720]   you. And if you're led of the Spirit, well, you're aware of all this. And if you feel
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:09.480]   an inclination to go the way of the ungodly and start walking that way, the Spirit pulls
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:15.000]   you up, and you begin to see all this. That's a sign that you're being led of the Spirit.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.960]   And let's go on. Then there's this great statement that we had in Ephesians 4, "Put
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:29.440]   off the old men." "You have not so learned," Christ, he says, "as to go on living like
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:38.160]   you used to live. I therefore say and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:45.160]   the other Gentiles walk"—how do they walk? Oh, "in the vanity of their mind."
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.480]   And if there was ever a generation that ought to know anything about vanity of mind, it's
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:59.520]   this one. We are seeing it at its very zenith. Vanity of the mind. The rapid, empty entertainments
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:07.600]   that people gloat in today. Vanity of their mind. "Having the understanding, darken.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.760]   Being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:18.160]   blindness of their heart." Or being past feeling, and they obviously are, aren't
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:24.200]   they? "Have given themselves over into lasciviousness." And that's what they've done. They've
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.440]   given themselves over. All restraints have gone. They're bursting and glurting in it
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:33.320]   in public even. "To work all uncleanness with greediness." And they're defending
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:40.400]   it. It's almost the most beautiful thing in the world now, this uncleanness with greediness.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:47.560]   "But ye have not so learned Christ, if so be that ye have heard him." You see, "Have
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.280]   you heard him?" says the apostle. If you're doing that sort of thing, you're not being
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.760]   led by the Spirit, and I'm beginning to doubt whether you've ever heard Christ at all.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.560]   You can't say, "I've heard Christ," and find your pleasure in that sort of thing.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.720]   If you have heard him and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus, well, what
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:11.880]   is this? Well, that you put off concerning the former way of living, the old man, which
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:20.880]   is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts. Put him off. What does this mean? Well, we
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.160]   haven't got the time to go into these things in detail. We've done that here two or three
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:31.480]   years ago. Let me summarize it by putting it to you like this. What it means is this.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:37.880]   You've got to talk to yourself. And I think that's half our trouble as Christians. We
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:43.840]   don't talk sufficiently to ourselves. You've got to preach to yourself. You've got to take
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:50.760]   yourself in him. And you've got to say, "Now, you've got to realize what you were. There
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:56.040]   you were. And the end of that was not only misery in this world and loss, but the end
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:02.920]   of that was hell. It's foul. It's evil. It's wrong."
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.200]   Now you were like that once. Your whole mind and outlook, that was natural to you, instinctive
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:13.680]   to you. But something's happened to you. Well, very well, you're a new man. Well, now then,
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:19.960]   if you're a new man, put off all that. It's as it were you had an old cloak which you
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:24.840]   always wore, and it was a thing you were very proud of and so on, and people recognized
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.480]   you when you came. You say, "Now then, I want them to know that I'm a different man. The
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.520]   very first sight of me will tell them that something's happened to me. What do I do then?
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.760]   Well, I take that old cloak off, the one I was so proud of with its gaudy colors. I put
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:42.480]   it off. And I put on a different cloak, so that when they look at me, they say, 'What's
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:47.600]   happened to him?'" That's it. In other words, we put off altogether that whole outlook,
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.200]   that whole way of thinking, everything that belonged to it, put it off. Say, "I'm no
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:58.160]   longer that. That's the man I once was. I'm no longer that." Very well, then, do that
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.920]   thoroughly, says the apostle, not only in your speech and thinking, but in your practice
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:11.440]   and everything. Put off the old man. You see how much more thoroughgoing the New Testament
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:18.520]   is than superficial teaching about a little temporary denial of self during Lent. No,
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:27.920]   no. Permanent Lent. Put him off forever. Disassociate yourself entirely from him. Don't say, "I'm
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.960]   going to do it for a few weeks, then I can look forward to going back to where I was."
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:39.200]   No, no. You're finished with him, once and forever. Put him off. Very well, leave it
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:49.200]   at that. Let's go on to another word that one finds so often in the New Testament, "abstain."
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:54.960]   This word "abstain" has become unpopular because it's been narrowed down a bit too
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:00.080]   much perhaps, and the moment you use the word "abstain," people think of alcoholic drink.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:05.160]   All right, but the word "abstain" covers a much wider field than that. Let me quote
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:13.560]   you the words of the apostle Peter again. "Dearly beloved," says Peter, in 1 Peter
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:27.240]   2, 11 and 12, "Dearly beloved, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul."
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:36.800]   Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they speak evil against
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:48.760]   you as of evildoers, they may behold your good works and glorify God in the day of visitation.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:56.720]   Now look at it. "Dearly beloved," says the pastoral heart of the apostle Peter,
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:05.440]   "abstain from fleshly lusts." Now he's writing to Christians, remember? Writing
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.760]   to Christians. He's not saying, "Now that you're a Christian, you've been converted,
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.800]   next step, hand yourself over for sanctification as you did for justification. It'll all
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:20.120]   be taken out of you, you'll have nothing to do." No, no. You've got to abstain from
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:28.800]   fleshly lusts. Why? Well, because they war against the soul. As a Christian, you've
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:34.160]   come to see that the most important thing is your soul, much more important than anything
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:41.480]   else, more important than the body, more important than the appearance, more important than success.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:50.200]   The soul, this immortal thing, this my relationship to God, these things, says Peter, they war
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:56.720]   against the soul. They're inimical to the soul's highest interest. Abstain from them.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:03.560]   And it doesn't matter what form these fleshly lusts take, it doesn't matter what form.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:08.880]   Fleshly lusts, let me remind you, do not only mean sex, they don't only mean drink. They
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.160]   can mean ambition. They can mean jealousy and envy and all these things. These things
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:20.400]   are all included by this apostle Paul. You remember in writing to the Ephesians in chapter
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:27.760]   2, he divides the lusts of the flesh into the desires of the flesh and of the mind.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:33.920]   There are lusts of the mind as well as of the body. "Very well," says the apostle,
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:39.240]   "abstain from them." Or let me give it to you again in the words of the apostle Paul,
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:43.920]   "I am so anxious that we should all be clear that you and I have got to do all this. This
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:50.760]   is mortification of the flesh." "This I say then, walk in the Spirit and ye shall not
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:58.160]   fulfill the lust of the flesh." That's Galatians 5, 16. "For the flesh lusteth against the
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.440]   Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh, and they are contrary the one to the other, so
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:09.160]   that ye cannot do the things that ye would. But if ye are led of the Spirit, ye are not
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.720]   under the law. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these." These are
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.120]   the things you abstain from. "Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:25.960]   idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings,
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:32.160]   murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like. Of the which I tell you before, as I
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:42.720]   have also told you in time past, that they that do such things shall not inherit the
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:52.960]   kingdom of God. Abstain from them, my dear friend, dearly beloved, abstain from fleshly
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:59.120]   lusts which war against the soul." The same is addressed to the individual. Listen to
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:07.400]   the apostle Peter pleading with his young disciple and follower, Timothy. 1 Timothy
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:16.480]   6, 11, "But thou, O man of God, flee these things, flee them, get away from them as far
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:24.440]   as you can, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness,
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:30.840]   fight the good fight of faith." Activity, you see, all along, telling us what to do.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:36.400]   "Lay hold on eternal life." You've got to do it. Don't wait to be laid hold of it.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.400]   That's happened to you. "Lay hold on it now. Apprehend that which has apprehended
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   you," to use the language of the apostle Paul. Well, here it is, you see, the teaching
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:51.000]   about abstaining from the things that are inimical to the best and the highest interests
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.120]   of the soul. The teaching about this, I say, is almost endless. But let me take you to
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:03.600]   another heading. So far we've been looking at these things as it were as they're outside
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:10.320]   us, and we've seen the injunctions to keep as far away as we can, to finish with it in
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:16.680]   our mind, and then rigidly to put this into practice. But now he goes, the teaching goes
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:25.640]   a bit further, and it becomes a little more subjective and personal in this way. I now
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:36.360]   find a word which says this. I'm going to read to you 1 Corinthians 9, 27. "But I,"
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:46.160]   says the apostle Paul, "keep under my body." You remember his illustration. "Knowing not
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:52.280]   that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize, so run that you may
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:35:03.040]   obtain. And every man that striveth for masteries is temperate in all things." Olympic Games,
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:09.600]   Test matches. The players don't drink, they don't smoke for a number of days before this
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:15.560]   great contest. Wonderful. Everybody applauds. Have you ever heard anybody saying that these
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.400]   cricketers and runners are narrow because they don't drink and smoke before this great
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:28.520]   event? Never. But when a Christian doesn't drink or smoke or do these various other things,
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:34.640]   narrow Christianity, miserable Christianity. And yet, you see, we are running in a race
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:40.360]   infinitely greater than Olympic races. We are in a match that's greater than any Test
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:48.600]   match that's ever been known. The apostle uses the illustration, "So run that you may
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.880]   obtain." And again, you see, the contrast is they do these things for just two or three
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.480]   days. They abstain for two or three days. The match is over, celebrate. But there's
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:07.240]   no end to the Christian race. The match is always on. "So run that you may obtain, and
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:12.960]   every man that striveth for mastery is just temperate in all things." Now they do it
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:20.400]   to obtain a corruptible crown. Oh, yes, but the world doesn't think so. The ashes, the
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:29.360]   cup, marvelous. And we admire these men for their abstinence. They do it to obtain a corruptible
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:38.920]   crown. But we, an incorruptible, a crown that will never fade away. "I therefore so run,"
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:47.320]   says the apostle, "not as uncertainly. So fight I, not as one that beateth the air,
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:54.440]   but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection. Lest that by any means when I
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:37:01.960]   have preached to others, I myself should be disapproved, I myself should be a cast away."
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.480]   Now that doesn't refer to salvation for a moment, but to his work as a preacher. Here
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:11.360]   is the prize, the crown that he's going for. Don't miss the whole point of that injunction
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:15.600]   by thinking it's teaching falling away from grace. It's got nothing to do with it. It's
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:22.880]   concerned about this other aspect. That's how the devil turns the point and the shaft
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:31.720]   of the scriptures. Listen to what the apostle is actually saying. "I keep under my body,"
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:36.960]   says Paul. And yet the popular teaching tells us, "You mustn't do that. That's legalism.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.680]   You hand yourself over, you hand it all over, it's done for you." It is not. "I keep under
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:50.120]   my body," says the apostle. "I fight not as one that beateth the air, I run not as
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:57.120]   one that is not a man. I am not as one that is not a man. I am not as one that is not
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:03.120]   a man. I am not as one that is not a man. I am not as one that is not a man. I am not
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:14.120]   as one that is not a man. I am not as one that is not a man. I am not as one that is
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:18.160]   not a man." We can't identify the deeds of the body. It's a great mystery this. We can't
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:26.520]   understand it. But God is so made as body, soul, and spirit. And you're in the body
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:30.240]   and you're responsible for the body, and the body interacts upon the soul and the soul
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:37.360]   upon the body. It is only the Spirit of God that can divide to the separating of the soul
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:42.000]   and the spirit and the joints and the marrow. We can't. Therefore we've got to recognize
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.040]   these things. Anything in your life that you find that tends to get you down, or to stand
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:52.120]   between you and thoughts of God and of Christ, and of being the man or the woman that you
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:58.680]   know you're meant to be in Christ, get rid of it. Keep it down. The body's got to be
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:06.560]   dealt with. You see, all these powers that God originally
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:16.920]   gave us worked before men fell and became a sinner. They all work together harmoniously.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:24.720]   The effect of sin has been that the greatest powers can become our greatest enemies. Some
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:29.440]   people are gifted with a great imagination. It's a wonderful gift. It makes your poets,
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:38.600]   your dramatists, they produce their glorious classics, their masterpieces. But is there
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:44.040]   anything that can be a greater problem to the Christian men than imagination? "Very
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:50.240]   well," says the apostle, "keep it under." It's a wonderful thing, imagination, yes,
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.960]   but sin comes in wrongly directed. All the powers that you've got, every one of them,
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:59.800]   the devil will try and turn them to his own end. So you've got to keep them under control.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:05.000]   Think of an obvious illustration. It's exactly like a man, I say once more, riding a horse
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.560]   or driving a horse, a spirited, powerful horse. Now the one thing he's got to do is to keep
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:16.840]   those reins firmly in his hand. It's a thrilling thing to be riding such a glorious animal
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.520]   filled with power, but you've got to watch him. He'll bolt, he'll run away with you,
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:28.280]   he may kill you. Keep a firm hold upon him, hold him in, put a bearing rein upon him perhaps.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:38.720]   That's the illustration. "Keep under my body." And you know the original there is most interesting.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:45.680]   What he really said was, "I beat it until it's black and blue. I pummel it." The body's
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.960]   a good thing, yes, but it can be so full of vigor and of power that it becomes a positive
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:54.640]   danger to me. Very well, I've got to keep it down for the sake of my soul. Why? Well,
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:03.000]   we are after a crown that is not corruptible. And therefore for the sake of the soul and
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.960]   for the sake of that great crowning they keep it under. Well, let me put it in the words
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:22.120]   of our Lord, or put it in the most extraordinary statement. "If thine eye offend thee, pluck
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:30.120]   it out and cast it from thee." "It is better for thee to enter into life having one eye
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:35.800]   rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire." "If thy hand or thy foot offend
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:41.360]   thee, cut them off and cast them from thee." "It is better for thee to enter into life
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:54.360]   halt or maim rather than having two hands and two feet to be cast into hell fire."
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.400]   Those are the words of the Lord Jesus Christ. They are to be taken metaphorically. These
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:07.800]   poor hermits, anchorites, monks and so on often took it literally. That's why they
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.520]   went wrong and became legalistic. This is something spiritual. Keep under the body.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:17.240]   Metaphorically, cut off hands and feet, pluck out eyes. It's better to be blind and yet
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:23.960]   holy and pleasing to God than it is to see the whole universe and sin.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:28.120]   And then for me to complete this section this morning, here is another wonderful word from
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:36.360]   the Apostle Paul. It is most essential in mortifying the flesh. "Make no provision
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:45.560]   for the flesh." That is Romans 13, 14. Let me read this extraordinary passage to you
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:50.640]   that the great Saint Augustine came upon when he was there in that agony and the moment
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:54.800]   of conversion had arrived. "Tolle, legge," came the voice. "Rise and read." And this
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:00.080]   is what he did read. "The night is far spent, the day is at end. Let us therefore
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:05.280]   cast off the works of darkness. Let us put on the armor of light. Let us walk honestly
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:10.960]   as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:17.600]   and envy. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:31.840]   the lusts thereof." Make no provision. Be careful about what you read. In newspapers,
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:36.560]   in books, be careful what you watch on the television and listen to on the radio. Make
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.720]   no provision for the flesh. You needn't give it any encouragement, it doesn't need
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:49.640]   any. It's bad enough as it is. Make no provision for it. Starve it. Starve it. Don't
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:57.400]   give it any food. And finally it comes to this. "Nip everything in the bud." When
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:01.160]   you see the approach, the first suggestion, "Nip it in the bud." Don't play with
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:08.040]   it, don't reason, don't argue. Reject sin in total. At the first appearance, "Nip
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:12.040]   it in the bud." It's easier then than later. It's not so strong. The more you
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:20.360]   play with it, the stronger it becomes. Have nothing at all to do with it. Mortification
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:29.000]   of sin, mortification of the deeds of the body, mortification of the members that are
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:39.400]   yet upon the earth. And that is how you do it, negatively. God give us grace to do
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:48.760]   so. God give us grace to see the race in which he set us. God give us a glimpse of
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:57.640]   the crown, the incorruptible crown that is awaiting us. Amen.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.560]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All
