[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - What can we say about the environmental conditions
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.880]   in which kids are seen from the time they're born
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.400]   through let's say adolescence and their teen years
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.760]   in terms of how their visual system wires up?
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.120]   And are there any recommendations
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.300]   that are coming from the scientific literature,
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.600]   clinical studies, clinical trials, excuse me, or otherwise
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.600]   that indicate what a healthy visual environment consists of?
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.080]   That's a great question.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.600]   And actually it's really relevant these days
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.480]   because myopia is so common.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.020]   It's more common in Asian populations.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.620]   It's called an epidemic in China.
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.660]   In California, we have a lot of Asian heritage
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.920]   or Asian Americans.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.980]   And so we see a lot, like at Stanford,
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.980]   we see a lot of myopia in kids and adults
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.640]   and really starting to get thoughtful
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.840]   on the science of myopia control.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.660]   How do we provide the right environments?
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.380]   Now, what's interesting is that for decades,
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.100]   the assumption, some of the data really led us
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.860]   to the path of thinking like, gosh,
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.600]   the more you spend at near activities,
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.200]   and these are mouse model experiments like you described,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.760]   but also well-designed human cohort studies,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.760]   figuring out like asking kids and families,
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.320]   like how long is your kid reading
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.740]   or in front of the computer?
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.900]   How myopic are they?
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.460]   How nearsighted are they?
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.000]   Versus how much time is your kid in front of the computer
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.200]   doing near work?
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.220]   How myopic or nearsighted are they?
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.040]   And these well-designed cohort studies
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.100]   did point towards this concept
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.480]   that if you do too much near work as a kid,
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.200]   that you're more likely to develop nearsightedness
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.760]   as you get through those sort of preteen
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.320]   and even into the teen years,
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.820]   which is when most of that myopia progression
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.740]   or eyeball elongation is actually happening
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.040]   to cause nearsightedness.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.280]   It's only been in the last few years
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.800]   that some really exciting studies
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.820]   have actually pointed in a slightly different direction.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.360]   And that's that maybe it's not all,
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.720]   not to say it's not about near activity,
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.600]   but maybe it's not all about near activity.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.080]   Maybe it's actually a little more
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.800]   about the kind of light we're getting into our eyes.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.560]   And I think you've talked about this before,
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.120]   and it's really important.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.960]   When they've now studied and asked the kids,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.240]   instead of just how much near
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.040]   and how much far are you doing,
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.860]   how much time are you spending indoors in indoor lighting,
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.560]   which doesn't have full spectrum light
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.340]   in a typical indoor environment,
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.120]   versus how much time are you spending outdoors,
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.360]   playing in the yard?
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.680]   You could be reading outside,
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.500]   but what kind of time are you spending outside?
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.800]   And of course, when you're outside in sunlight,
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.220]   even it's in direct sunlight,
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.880]   you're getting a different spectrum
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.800]   of kind of full spectrum lighting from the sun.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.640]   And it looks like it's pretty clear now, actually,
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.640]   that it has maybe more to do with outdoor lighting time
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.240]   than just near work.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.720]   And so I think that we've actually already seen
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.640]   the first couple of randomized controlled trials
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.040]   where they're having kids intentionally
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.400]   spending time outdoors versus sort of standard life,
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.080]   which is gonna be often much more indoor time.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.880]   And seeing some effects,
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.720]   you follow those kids over a couple of years,
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.800]   and the kids who spend time outdoors
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.060]   are progressing in their nearsightedness less.
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.560]   Like their nearsighted prescription is not getting as strong
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.840]   as the kids who are spending more time indoors.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.760]   And there's some pretty good biology
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.160]   that's getting worked out, going back to animal models,
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.800]   more about how that might be working in the retina,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.720]   in this inside the eye.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.480]   But it's pretty compelling concept.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.440]   And so, as a parent, you may wanna be telling your kid,
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.200]   like, okay, yeah, I want you to read that book,
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.760]   or if your kid's playing on the phone or something like that
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.360]   or the iPad or something like that,
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.920]   they're allowed that time.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.200]   Okay, you can have that time,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.760]   but I want you to spend some of the time
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.480]   that you're doing that outdoors.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.520]   - Are there any thresholds for the amount of time
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.240]   that one would suggest their child be outdoors
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.760]   to get that full spectrum light?
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.080]   - It's a great question.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.600]   We talk about cohort studies
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.480]   where we just ask people, what are they doing?
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.020]   And there seems to be a little bit
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.280]   of what we would call a dose-dependent response.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.680]   Maybe the more time outdoors might be better.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.120]   We don't know if there's an upper limit.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.160]   Like, gosh, if you go over two or three hours,
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.240]   there's no additional benefit.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.000]   We talk about that in cohort studies.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.480]   The real gold standard
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.280]   for answering these kinds of questions
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.080]   are randomized controlled trials
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.120]   and specifically placebo-controlled
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.520]   or a control group that's not getting the intervention.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.920]   That's our highest level of evidence for clinical evidence
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.000]   for any of this kind of science
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.280]   when we're talking about humans
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.920]   or preclinical models in the laboratory.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.900]   And the study that hasn't been done yet
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.840]   to really answer that question
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.640]   is to randomize kids to telling this group of kids,
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.440]   you just do your normal life.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.280]   Tell this group of kids, we want you outside an hour.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.180]   This group of kids, we want you outside two hours a day.
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.120]   This group of kids, three hours a day.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.400]   And see between the groups, is there a big difference?
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.240]   Like, we have pretty good evidence now
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.760]   from the studies that have been done
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.760]   that the difference between zero
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.760]   and one or two hours is clearly there.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.320]   Is five minutes enough?
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.880]   Is five hours better?
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.280]   I don't think we know the answers to those questions yet.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.520]   Like, what's the right dose?
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.280]   But there's probably at least some dose dependence to that.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.960]   - And I can imagine it's a little bit hard to tease apart
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.520]   the near far viewing from the indoor outdoor
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.120]   because yes, of course,
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.980]   a child could be outside on an iPad up close,
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.720]   but it's hard to imagine that at some point
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.400]   they aren't seeing off into the distance,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.020]   far viewing as it's called.
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.360]   And the reverse is also true if you're indoors,
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.560]   unless you live in a very, very large home
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.740]   or you're staring off a balcony,
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.940]   far viewing is much harder to achieve.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.240]   And perhaps it isn't important to isolate these variables.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.400]   Although I can see the challenge
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.520]   in developing a really good clinical trial,
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.320]   randomized clinical trial for this.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.060]   Meanwhile, I'll go into the grave shouting,
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.920]   or saying rather and suggesting
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.640]   that people get some morning sunlight in their eyes
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.140]   to set their circadian rhythm.
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.540]   But far viewing a few, at least a few minutes
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.580]   and ideally hours per day,
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.980]   or a mixture of near and far viewing by being outdoors
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.220]   just seems like a good thing to do regardless of age.
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.040]   (upbeat music)
