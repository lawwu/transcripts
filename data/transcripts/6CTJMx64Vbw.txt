[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   We currently understand very little about the human brain.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Do you also hope that the work at Neuralink will help us understand more about the human mind, about the brain?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Yeah, I think the work at Neuralink will definitely shed a lot of insight into how the brain and the mind works.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Right now, just the data we have regarding how the brain works is very limited.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   We've got fMRI, which is kind of like putting a stethoscope on the outside of a factory wall,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   and then putting it all over the factory wall, and you can sort of hear the sounds,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   but you don't know what the machines are doing, really.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   You can infer a few things, but it's a very broad brushstroke.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   In order to really know what's going on in the brain, you have to have high-precision sensors,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   and then you want to have stimulus and response, like if you trigger a neuron, how do you feel, what do you see,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   how does it change your perception of the world?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   You're speaking to physically just getting close to the brain, being able to measure signals from the brain,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   will give us sort of open the door inside the factory.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Yes, exactly. Being able to have high-precision sensors that tell you what individual neurons are doing,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   and then being able to trigger a neuron and see what the response is in the brain,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   so you can see the consequences of if you fire this neuron, what happens, how do you feel, what does it change?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   It'll be really profound to have this in people, because people can articulate their change,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   like if there's a change in mood, or if they can tell you if they can see better or hear better,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   or be able to form sentences better or worse, or their memories are jogged, or that kind of thing.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Thank you.
