[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.500]   Well, one reason parenting is such daunting work is because of the balance required of us parents.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:16.500]   We don't want to be too strict or too lenient, not too consequence-driven, and not so gracious as to overlook rebellion.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.000]   Into this balancing act comes a question from a young mom who wants to be kind and who expects to be obeyed.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Her name is Emily.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.500]   "Hello, Pastor John. I thank you for your ministry. It has helped me delight in God immensely.
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:38.000]   Recently, I have been stomped on how to blend two seemingly contradictory facets of biblical character into the parenting of my two small children.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Number one, me displaying Christ-like humility and gracious servanthood, a la Philippians 2, verses 1 to 11.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   And number two, me requiring honor, respect, and obedience from my kids, a la Ephesians 6, 1 to 3.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.500]   Could you help flesh out for me what essentially discipline looks like with both of these aspects?
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.000]   How to discipline children in humility while maintaining my position of respect and authority?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I feel stuck bouncing between being too strong with the "Obey Me" card and then trying to balance myself by being gracious and perhaps requiring too little obedience and respect.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.500]   I'm so confused. Can you help Mama out?"
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:33.000]   I hope so, because of all the questions Emily might ask, I think she has asked an absolutely excellent, central question.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   This question gets at the essence, I think, of gospel parenting.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:53.500]   That is, how to raise children that have a humble respect for God-given authority, whether in parents or husbands or teachers or policemen or pastors or civic laws,
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.500]   and also see that God's pattern of leadership is servant leadership.
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.000]   That leadership is not synonymous with self-exaltation or pride or bragging or power-grabbing,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   but, as Philippians 2, 3 says, "counts others more significant than itself and pursues the good of others even when it's very costly."
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   In other words, the challenge in parenting is how to parent so that authentic, gospel-shaped young people come into existence.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:45.500]   And before I give any particular counsel about that tension, I should remind us all that no matter how excellently we teach and model gospel leadership,
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:58.000]   we parents are not the decisive influence in whether our children come to faith and walk in what we have taught.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   We are a huge influence, but we are not the decisive, final influence, which is why we soak everything we do in prayer
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   and why we do not load ourselves down with the burden of being God, which we simply cannot bear.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Now, back to the specific question, and I'll make it even more paradoxical.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   How do you model the command to turn the other cheek while disciplining a child for disobedience?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.500]   How do you model love bears all things and endures all things while requiring compliance to the rules of the family?
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:56.000]   How do you model not returning evil for evil while spanking for blatant disregard for your authority?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.500]   Now, here's some suggestions.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   Number one, there should always be a steady stream of more or less formal teaching—call it catechism, catechesis, whatever—
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   a steady stream of more or less formal teaching happening in the home in which, in age-appropriate ways,
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.500]   you are trying to explain what the Bible means.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:32.500]   And that includes passages about children obeying parents and respecting parents and being kind and generous with siblings
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   and how parents are called to teach and discipline and not provoke their children for their good
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:46.500]   and how we're all to love our enemies and do good to those who hate us and return good for evil and bless those who curse us.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:57.500]   And this ongoing steady stream of teaching will include, over time, efforts to help children understand that there are authority structures—
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.000]   parent-child, police civilian, pastor-church member, husband-wife, government citizen—
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.500]   authority structures that God has created that give different shape to how we love each other.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:21.000]   In other words, God has given to parents a role for how to love their children that he does not give to children and vice versa.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   So parents love their children in ways that children don't love their parents.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:36.500]   For example, by teaching them, by setting boundaries for them, by showing them the painful consequences that happen in the real world if you disrespect God-given authority.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   In other words, alongside the thousands of daily interactions in the family which do teach,
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.500]   I'm saying there should be a steady stream—every day, virtually—
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   a steady stream of teaching that provides an ever-growing grid, a biblical grid,
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.500]   through which a child comes to understand the world increasingly and all the relational dynamics of the home.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.000]   So that's my first suggestion, that steady stream of teaching.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.500]   Here's number two.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:17.000]   I think one reason God designed families to ordinarily have two parents instead of just one
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   is that this creates wonderful possibilities of interaction with children that display both vigilance for a parent being respected
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   and the humility of a parent not defending himself.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.500]   For example, if a child is very disrespectful to his mother, for example,
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.000]   say you got a 12-year-old or maybe just a 4-year-old or a 15-year-old for that matter,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   and the father—and he says something very disrespectful to his mother, and the father is in the kitchen,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   that father steps over, and she isn't saying anything yet, that father steps over,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   takes this kid by the arm with a grip he knows means something really serious here.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   "Dad has a hold of my arm."
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   He looks him right in the eye and says, "You may not talk to your mother that way in this house."
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Now, the mother, in the meantime, having been stuck up for by her husband, doesn't communicate a self-pitying woundedness,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   "Oh, poor me."
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   This makes really sick relationships in the home when you do that.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Nor does she communicate a smug sense of the child got what is due.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Instead, what she's communicating is a demeanor of love that communicates, "Son, daughter, I want what's best for you, but daddy's right."
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Now, there are dozens of settings, it seems to me, in which the interplay of mother and father capture both sides of the tension
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   between humble patience on the one hand and severe rebuke on the other hand.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   So that's my second suggestion.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Now, here's the third one.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Many families are single-parent families, and many times during the day, a two-parent family has one parent with the kids, right?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   For like eight, ten hours a day, mom might be the one who's got to bear the whole burden of the discipline here.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   So what are some of the ways to help a child see both humility and servanthood in the Christian life of his parents,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   as well as strong God-appointed authority to be respected and obeyed?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   So here are just several bullet points.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   One, avoid correlating anger with the demand for respect.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Insist on it and require it in tones of strength without anger.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Speak of it in times of happiness.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Talk about it. Talk about respect and obedience in times of happiness, not just in the times of angry crisis.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Number two, let the appropriate apologies that you owe your children be woven into your life.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Never think, "Oh, this is going to weaken my authority if I get down low and say I'm sorry for some tone of voice I used this morning."
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   It won't. It won't weaken if you lovingly are strong when you should be.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Number three, constantly model for the child the role of servant in all your relationships that the child is watching,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   including your relationship with the child.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Don't come across just as a boss.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   So many children feel like, "I'm just a slave here. All they do is say, 'Do, do, do, do.'"
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   This does not mean picking up his toys when you have told him to pick up his toys.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   A lot of parents cave on that and think it's humility. That's not humility. That's stupid.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   But it might mean surprising him by cleaning his room before you ask him to clean it.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Or offering to take him somewhere in the car as a teenager before he asks you.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   But here's a warning. Children, including those teenagers, maybe especially,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   children are slow to see this for what it is, this servanthood of mom or dad.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   They may have to wait 20 years before mom and dad hear back in a letter how brokenheartedly thankful they are for what they gave them
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   and how unthankful they were for so many years.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I lavished my mother with thanks in my mid-20s a hundred times more than I did when I was 14 and 15 and 16.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And I'm ashamed of it. I'm ashamed of it.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   But that's what parents have to reckon with.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Kids assume parents are going to serve them, and you can't do much about that
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   if you are a loving, firm, caring, sacrificial parent, except pray that when they turn 25,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   you're going to get a letter or a phone call that's brokenhearted in their lavish gratitude to you.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Number four, let the dominant tone of the relationship be one of delight in your child.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Let him feel cherished and admired and enjoyed, not just corrected and instructed.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Otherwise, he'll feel that you're just using him for your private ease, not his good.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And number five—I've got two more—number five, don't equate humility with leniency,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   as if the only way to communicate humility is by not requiring rigorous obedience.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Humility, in fact, may be what is needed to deny yourself the comforts of not dealing with a child's disobedience.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   And finally, teaching grace and mercy will mean that now and then, when wisdom dictates,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   you will in fact not punish a punishable offense.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Just to give the child a taste of that form of grace,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   knowing that requiring obedience most of the time is also a form of grace,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   but you won't neglect discipline so often that it begins to be expected by the child.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   So parenting is an art, not a science, and we must be praying constantly for wisdom from above.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Like James 3:17, "The wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   open to reason, full of mercy, good fruits, impartial and sincere, and a harvest of righteousness
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   is sown in peace by those who make peace."
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Yes, the art of gospel parenting, indeed.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, for your seasoned counsel here and for speaking out of your many decades of being a dad.

[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Well, back in a 2001 Gallup poll, respondents were asked to attribute the description "emotional"
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   to one of the two sexes. Was "emotional" truer of men or of women?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Of course, 90% said "emotional" was truer of women.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Such a survey adds fuel to a very old stereotype, a stereotype that is at least as old as Aristotle,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   that says the pink brain is more emotional and the blue brain is more rational.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   But does this dichotomy hold up in Scripture?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   That is the question we're going to end the week with on Friday.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   That should be very interesting, Pastor John.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Until then, I'm your host Tony Reiki. We'll see you then.
