[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.080]   Our first question comes from Irfana, who asks,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.800]   "How can a freelancer perform deep work?
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.920]   The freelancer has to create his personal brand on LinkedIn.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.520]   You know, suppose he's a social media manager,
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.200]   he needs to have a social media presence."
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.080]   Well, Irfana, I think this is an example
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.960]   of an important phenomenon to discuss briefly,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.960]   which is single drop social media use.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.920]   And what I mean by single drop social media use
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.920]   is the mindset that if there is any social media use
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.520]   that is necessary in your life,
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.880]   so something professionally or what have you,
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.920]   there's, you know, job applicants
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.400]   and you have to check for questions on Facebook
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.360]   or something like that,
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.800]   that if there is any, a single drop of social media use
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.680]   in the pool that is your activity time,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.600]   then you have to just unrestrictedly use social media
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.120]   from there on out.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.800]   And that's what I'm sensing in this question,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.880]   that as a freelancer,
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.680]   there's some stuff you might want to do on LinkedIn.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.440]   Maybe you have a LinkedIn Pulse-style newsletter
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.760]   and/or you have to keep up on inquiries from people
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.720]   or keep up with your network.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.280]   I don't know exactly what it is,
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.880]   but in your mind that small amount of mandated use means,
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.200]   I guess I just have to be on social media all the time.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.560]   And that's not the case.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.480]   In fact, this would be the challenge I would give you.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.200]   Let us say I said,
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.260]   here's the new law under a penalty of $100,000 fine.
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.480]   You are only allowed to be logged into LinkedIn
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.500]   for 20 minutes once a week.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.880]   I bet you would be fine.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.160]   I bet you would be fine.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.020]   What would happen if that was the law?
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.600]   Well, first of all, if you were posting content on LinkedIn,
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.880]   you would just write it elsewhere.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.040]   And during that 20 minutes, you would post,
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.320]   you would make it weekly.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.680]   If there were requests coming in
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.120]   or you wanted to do some networking,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.320]   just during that 20 minutes,
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.720]   you would answer the request
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.160]   and you would maybe do some pokes.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.040]   Maybe you would update your profile to somehow say,
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.920]   I do LinkedIn messages on Fridays
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.100]   or whatever day you do it.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.400]   Maybe you'd miss a couple things
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.660]   or a couple of people would be annoyed
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.020]   that you were slow getting back into them,
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.000]   but who cares, right?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.140]   This is a numbers game.
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.640]   It's just over time being on there
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.100]   may be surfaces the occasional opportunity.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.920]   So you would be absolutely fine in 20 minutes once a week,
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.600]   which is a negligible footprint.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.840]   This is the type of exercise I want people to do
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.840]   when they think about unavoidable social media use.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.200]   What if I was only doing this
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.520]   for a very small amount of time, quite infrequently?
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.840]   Could I really make that work?
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.240]   Would I get most of the value?
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.360]   And I think in most cases, the answer would be yes.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.800]   So do not allow the single drop
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.300]   of social media requirement in your life
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.440]   be the instigating force that gets you
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.120]   to then endlessly lose yourself into those distractions.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.700]   (upbeat music)
