[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   You will remember that we are dealing at the moment with the list of scriptural quotations
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.280]   that the Apostle Paul brings forward and deduces in the third chapter of his epistle to the
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:25.640]   Romans in order to establish his proposition that he has proved both Jews and Gentiles
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:34.240]   that they are all under sin. And then he goes on in verse 10 to say, "As it is written,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.480]   there is none righteous, no, not one. There is none that understandeth, there is none
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:48.040]   that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:57.320]   There is none that doeth good, no, not one. Their throat is an open sepulcher, with their
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:05.400]   tongues they have used deceit. The poison of asps is under their lips, whose mouth is
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.360]   full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and misery
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.600]   are in their ways, and the way of peace have they not known. There is no fear of God before
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.560]   their eyes." Now we are in the process of dealing with this list of quotations which
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.840]   the Apostle here gives us. And I suggested to you that they can be divided conveniently
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:42.560]   into three main sections. The first section is from verse 10 to verse 12. The second verse
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.680]   is 13 to 17, and the third verse 18 alone. Now we are in the process of looking at the
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.720]   first group in verses 10 to 12. And here I suggested the Apostle gives us a general description
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.560]   and account of man and of sin. Here is the general description before he comes to the
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.600]   particular. Not only do we find that there is this division into three main sections,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:21.120]   but the sections can be further subdivided. And this first section can be further subdivided
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.800]   into two main divisions. First of all, in verses 10 and 11, the Apostle describes the
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:37.880]   actual state of men in sin or under sin. And then in verse 12 he shows us the consequences
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:46.640]   of being in that state. But still, the two subdivisions are subdivisions of this general
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.560]   description which he gives in these three verses of men in sin.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.000]   Now we began the consideration of the actual state last week, and we dealt with this first
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.240]   statement, "There is none righteous, no, not one." Every man, as the result of the
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:12.320]   fall, is lacking in that original righteousness which man had, and which God demands of all
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.400]   of us, because he made man in his own image, and he made him righteous. Very well, we take
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.920]   up this evening the second statement, which gives us an account of this actual state and
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.560]   condition in which man is as the result of sin. And here it is, "There is none that
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:42.240]   understandeth." You notice the universality of the statement? There are no exceptions.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.440]   There is none that understandeth, not one. What does he mean here by "understanding"?
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.720]   Well, if you like, you can use an alternative word. You can say that there is none that
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.800]   is wise. There is none that has the possession of wisdom.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:08.160]   Now, this is, of course, a very great theme in the Bible, in the Scriptures everywhere.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.960]   Indeed in many places, it is clearly the essence of the biblical teaching with respect to sin.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.200]   What is sin? Well, sin is folly. It is the fool who hath said in his heart, "There
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:27.360]   is no God." An absence of wisdom. This same apostle in writing to the Ephesians,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.920]   in the fourth chapter of the eighteenth verse, puts it like this, "Having the understanding
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:38.200]   darkened." It's the same thing. To have the understanding darkened is not to have
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.680]   understanding, because the understanding obviously is meant to be enlightened. Therefore, if
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.640]   it is darkened, it means there is no understanding. Or, you can put it like this, if you like.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:58.600]   When he says that there is none that understandeth, what he is saying is that there is nobody
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:06.360]   who comes up to this description. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. It's
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.600]   an absence of that. Well, now, what does he mean by this? When
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:19.720]   he says there is none that understandeth, he means that they are lacking in an apprehension
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.960]   of spiritual truth. They are lacking in an understanding of divine things. They have,
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.240]   of course, a kind of secular, earthly, carnal understanding. Some of them may be very proficient
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.040]   in art or in science or in various other branches of knowledge and of culture. They've got
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.600]   an understanding there, expert in politics, expert in business, full of understanding
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.640]   and insight. But man, as the result of sins, says the apostle, and every single man who
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:59.520]   has ever been born into the world since the fall, has not a spiritual understanding. If
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.360]   you like, he is dead in trespasses and sins. As far as these things are concerned, he might
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.960]   as well be dead. They mean nothing at all to him. He has no apprehension. He has no
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.840]   insight. He has no understanding at all. You can put them before him and they mean nothing
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.360]   at all to him. He says they are quite irrelevant. Now, you notice, this is a perfect description
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.760]   of the average person today, who rarely just dismisses Christianity. It's a bad joke,
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.520]   as far as he is concerned. With his sophistication and his learning, he feels that all this is
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:42.320]   so utterly remote from life and from his problems. Thereby, of course, he is just betraying his
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:49.800]   complete lack of understanding. Now, this is so important that I must just give you
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.480]   some further headings. Understanding of what? Well, primarily, of course, an understanding
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:04.680]   of the truth about God. God is not in his thoughts at all. He may say, as I have quoted
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:12.680]   to you, "There is no God." He completely lacks an understanding, apprehension of God.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.400]   Now, the apostle is going to elaborate that, so we don't stay with it. Another thing it
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:29.800]   means is this. A man in sin may lack an understanding of himself, of his own nature, of his spiritual
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:38.680]   character. He is content to regard himself as an animal, and he even boasts of that.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.520]   He dislikes this biblical account of himself as a living soul. He puts himself amongst
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.000]   the animals. He says he's evolved from them, that he belongs to them, that that is his
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.600]   setting. And he has no conception of this biblical conception of men, which is that
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:02.160]   man is a spiritual being, essentially, and meant for God, and meant to live a spiritual
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:09.320]   kind of life in relationship to God. He has no understanding of that. In the same way,
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:16.760]   he has no understanding of sin, no understanding of his own sinful nature, no understanding
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:22.160]   of the precarious position in which he finds himself, no understanding of the wrath of
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:29.440]   God, no understanding of God's way of salvation. He's never seen the need of it. It means
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:37.120]   nothing to him, and he ridicules it and pours his scorn upon it. No understanding. What
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.800]   a perfect description of the vast majority of people alive at this moment, as it has
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:53.160]   always been. In other words, he has not either an understanding of his own true happiness.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:59.440]   He thinks he's an expert on happiness, but he has no conception of true happiness. He
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:07.320]   has no understanding at all as to the real way of having joy, a heavenly, a spiritual
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.720]   joy. He doesn't understand it at all. What is offered to him in that respect he regards
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:18.760]   as boring and dull, something which is almost insulting to him. And above all, as I have
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:27.320]   said, he has no conception at all as to his eternal destiny. He doesn't think about it.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.000]   He doesn't like to think about it. He doesn't like to be invited to think about it. He regards
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.720]   that as being morbid. He does everything he can to postpone thoughts of death, and of
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.200]   the end of his life, and of the unknown eternity to which he's going. He hates it. He doesn't
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:47.200]   want to be reminded. It is because he has no real understanding of it.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:55.080]   Well, now, as I say, the case of the Bible from beginning to end is that that is, in
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:05.640]   a sense, the cause of all our troubles, this fatal lack of understanding. Therefore, I
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:12.800]   say, work it out for yourselves. Now, that brings me to the next and the third thing
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:22.200]   which the apostle tells us under this particular subsection. And it is the third and last thing
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:30.240]   which he tells us about our actual state as the result of sin. "There is none that seeketh
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:40.560]   after God." Now, again, I must emphasize the universality. It is still none, not a single
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:47.920]   exception. The apostle's assertion is that there is no individual who seeks after God.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:54.000]   Now, we cannot but again notice the marvelous sequence and order and logical arrangement
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.800]   of these thoughts. You notice how the apostle puts it. He says, "Man is unrighteous."
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.480]   Why is he unrighteous? Because he hasn't got understanding. And then, because he hasn't
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.720]   got understanding, of course, he doesn't seek after God. Because he lacks that understanding
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.240]   that I've been describing, he doesn't seek after God.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:20.360]   Now, it's very important that we should be clear as to what this means. What he means
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:30.840]   by seeking after God is a desire for God, a desire to know God, and a desire to enjoy
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:41.400]   God. That's what he means by seeking. He means also a desire to worship God and to
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:47.280]   seek him in prayer. Now, let me give it to you by contrast. Take Job, for instance, who
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:54.000]   cries out, "Oh, that I knew where I might find him." There's a man who's seeking after
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.360]   God. "Oh, that I knew where I might find him." Or, as the psalmist puts it again in the 42nd
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:09.560]   Psalm, "As the heart tanteth after the water brooks, so my heart." That's it. He longs
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:15.520]   for him, the living God. He pants after him. He's seeking God. Now, that's the content
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:23.720]   of this term, "seeketh" after God. And, of course, it includes this also. It's a seeking
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:33.160]   to know the will of God in obedience, because he's anxious to do the will of God.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:39.000]   Now, the apostle says that man is the result of the fallen because he's under sin. He does
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.480]   not seek God like this at all. He'll put it again in the 8th chapter in these words. "The
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:52.720]   natural mind," he says, "is enmity against God, and is not subject to the law of God,
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   neither indeed can be." That's it. You see, it is that enmity. And because it is that
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:04.960]   enmity against God, he doesn't seek God. He does his best to avoid God, to get away from
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   God. And because he doesn't seek God, he doesn't seek his law. It's that enmity against
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:17.080]   God, and is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:24.200]   Now, I've gone into it in detail for this reason, that it may well be that there is
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.720]   someone present who says, "Surely the apostle is going too far. Surely he has no right to
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:36.620]   say that every person who has been born since the fall of Adam has been guilty of not seeking
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:42.080]   God. Surely," says this person, "I know many people today in this world who are not
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.960]   Christians at all, and who never go to a place of worship, but I wouldn't like to say that
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:54.080]   they don't seek God, because I do know that they say their prayers. I do know that when
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:00.840]   they're in trouble, they offer up a prayer to God. Isn't that seeking God? They're
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:06.280]   good people." Well, the answer of the apostle is no, if you put its full content into this
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:13.560]   word "seek." You see that they don't seek God at all. To have some kind of intellectual
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:20.640]   interest in the possibility of God, or the being of God, is not to seek God. To seek
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.560]   God doesn't just mean that you mechanically say your prayers because you haven't really
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.680]   thought enough about it, perhaps, to stop saying the prayers that you were taught when
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:33.120]   you were a child. That isn't seeking God. Seeking means that you're really looking
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:40.440]   for something. You remember the sequence used by our Lord, "Ask and ye shall receive,
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.880]   seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you." Seeking is much more
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.960]   active than asking. So the moment you realize this content of the word "seek," you begin
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:57.040]   to see that the apostle's statement is surely quite right. Mechanical prayers don't mean
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.840]   that we are seeking God. Seeking God means that you realize the person of God, and you
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:08.320]   are trying to find him and to get into his presence, and to realize his presence. That's
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:19.960]   it. And what the apostle says is that there is none who seeks God in that way. To seek
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:29.780]   God means to desire God above everything and everybody else, to seek his glory, to be anxious
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:36.720]   to promote his glory. To seek God in the biblical sense means that God is the center of our
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:44.640]   thinking and it is the supreme object of our lives to know him and to live to his glory.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.160]   Well, let me quote it again. You remember that first question in the shorter Catechism
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:54.680]   of the Westminster Confession? What is the chief end of men? The answer is the chief
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:16:02.160]   end of men is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever. And a man of whom that is true
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:08.160]   is a man who is seeking God. And what the apostle says is that no man by nature left
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:16.960]   to himself has ever sought God. Now it's a tremendously important statement this. You
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:23.720]   see this is one of the most valuable scriptures by means of which you can convict the so-called
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:31.680]   good person who has never committed any big, open, flagrant sins and who has always done
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.560]   a lot of good and has been philanthropic and who has always said his prayers and so on.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.760]   Here's the way to convict such a person. The apostle lays it down categorically that
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:49.080]   there has never been a single person who has sought God. And you will find that these people
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.920]   have never really sought God at all. They have, like the Pharisee that our Lord himself
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:00.000]   depicted in his picture of the publican and the Pharisee who went up into the temple to
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.440]   pray, these people have very often told God what wonderful people they are. But like that
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.680]   Pharisee they have never sought him. The Pharisee didn't ask God for anything on that occasion,
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:16.200]   you remember. He just gave him a list of his excellencies. That's not seeking God. It's
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:22.360]   almost patronizing God. Well, therefore, we must realize something of the implications
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:31.440]   of this statement, this doctrine. You see, what it means is this, that if you and I can
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:38.980]   claim as Christian people that we are seeking God tonight, there is only one explanation
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:49.440]   for it, and that is that God has first sought us. Men in sin, under sin, does not seek God.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:56.280]   There is none that seeketh after God. There is nothing so unscriptural as to say that
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.040]   the natural man is seeking for God, and his trouble is that nobody has ever given him
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.840]   the gospel that he's been waiting and expecting to hear. This is a blank contradiction of
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:12.320]   that theory. There is none that seeketh after God. Man by nature is a God-hater. He is at
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:18.280]   enmity against God. He is dead in prosperities and sins. Show me a man, therefore, who can
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:23.600]   say honestly that he is seeking God, and I show you a man who has been quickened by God's
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:34.200]   Spirit, whom God has sought. We love him. Why? Because he first loved us. Left to ourselves,
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:42.440]   we would never seek him. We would remain permanently at enmity against him. You see, these quotations
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:48.520]   that the apostle brings together here in this great catena of evidence, they are all of
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:53.520]   tremendous significance and importance. Never rush over them. Look at them, examine them,
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.040]   give them their full content, see the inevitable deductions that must be drawn from them.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:06.120]   Now then, there is the end of his general description and account of man as he is. That's
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:17.880]   the description, I say, of his actual state. But now, because of that, something follows.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:23.440]   That sort of thing can't be true of a man without its having an effect immediately upon
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:29.400]   his general conduct and behavior. Notice the word "general." We still haven't come to
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.600]   the particular effect in conduct, it's still the general effect in conduct. And here it
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:46.560]   is for us in verse 12. "They are all gone out of the way. They are together become unprofitable.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:58.160]   There is none that doeth good, no, not one." Now then, again, I must emphasize the extraordinary
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:05.560]   logical sequence which we are dealing with. The apostle, as I reminded you last week,
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.560]   didn't choose these verses at random. He obviously had a scheme in his mind, and he
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.120]   is working it out with us. That's man's state. Well, because of that, this is true.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:21.760]   Here's the first thing. "All have gone out of the way." Remember again that it's
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:31.320]   everyone, it is all, there is no exception to it. What does this mean? Gone out of the
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:40.440]   way. What way? Well, obviously, God's way. The true path. The path that God had marked
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:46.520]   out for men, the highway on which God had set men and in which he intended him to travel.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.160]   They've all turned their backs and have gone in the other direction. They're not walking
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.520]   in the right direction any longer. Or, as our Lord puts it, instead of walking in the
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:21:00.640]   narrow way, they're walking along the broad way. They're on the wrong road.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:07.160]   I need not remind you that this is something, again, that is stated so frequently in Scripture.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:17.960]   Listen to Isaiah 53, 6. "All we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned every one
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:24.400]   to his own way." That's it. And there are many other quotations that I could have given
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:31.440]   you. Now, again, let us not lose sight of the universality of this pronouncement. This
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:37.360]   is the devastating effect of the fall. That every person born into this world since that
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:43.960]   fall of Adam has deliberately gone his own way, and it's the wrong way. Like a sheep
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:49.160]   he's gone astray. He's not walking in God's way, not on the highway that leads to God
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:22:00.760]   and to heaven. All have gone out of the way. What a terrible thing sin is. How important
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:07.160]   that we should look at humanity in sin like this. They're on the road to hell. They're
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:12.080]   on the road to the devil. They've got their backs turned to God. They're going entirely
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:17.200]   in the wrong direction. That's the way we're to look at them.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.760]   But come to the second point which he gives. They're all gone out of the way. They have
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:31.080]   together become unprofitable. Together means all together. It also means wholly and without
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:37.920]   exception. It means simultaneously. Together they have become unprofitable. Now what does
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:47.800]   he mean by this unprofitable? Well it means of course that they're worthless. But the
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:52.920]   actual word that the apostle used is a very interesting one. It's very graphic and very
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:23:02.560]   descriptive. The word that he used here to bring out this idea of unprofitableness is
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:11.760]   the word that was used for milk when it had gone sour. You suddenly want your milk for
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:17.120]   a cup of tea or something. And you go and you look at it and at once you see that it's
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.320]   gone sour and it's worthless. You don't like sour milk in your tea so you throw it
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.400]   down the drain. Worthless. The milk that was good and that was meant to be good, meant
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.720]   to be food, and meant to give enjoyment is turned sour. And it's useless, worthless,
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:35.040]   throw it down the drain. That's the condition of mankind as the result of all this that
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:40.720]   has become true. It's become unprofitable, of no value. It's useless. It's like salt
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.280]   that's lost its savour. That's good for nothing henceforward but to be thrown onto
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:56.640]   the dung heap. And that is the result which has followed in the case of mankind because
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.080]   of the sin of Adam.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:07.080]   Now it's very important that we should understand this again quite clearly. Unprofitable. "Ah,
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.640]   but, says someone, surely that's again too sweeping a statement that isn't true.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.120]   I know many people who are not Christian but they're doing very good. They're doing
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.680]   a great deal of good. They're very good citizens. They're very valuable people.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.960]   They're philanthropic. They give large sums of money to causes and things like that.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:30.280]   Surely you can't say that they're unprofitable. Well, the Scripture says they're unprofitable.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:37.880]   And in what way? Well, they're unprofitable from the standpoint of God, not from the standpoint
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:44.960]   of secular morality. It's important we should keep these distinctions clear. The Bible doesn't
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:50.160]   say that every man is as bad and as rotten as a man can ever be or ever become, but it
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.560]   does say this, that every single one of us, apart from the grace of God in Jesus Christ,
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:03.200]   is from the standpoint of God and of salvation entirely without goodness and completely unprofitable.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.040]   Let me give you some other quotations which say the same thing. The Scripture tells us
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   that all our righteousness is as filthy rags. That's another way of putting it. Or take
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:22.600]   the way the Apostle Paul puts it after his conversion. You remember the autobiography
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:29.060]   in Philippians 3, how before his conversion he was very proud of himself, his proficiency
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:35.220]   in the law, and very proud of his own righteousness as he judged the law to indicate it at that
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:41.640]   particular time, excelling others. Wonderfully good, godly, righteous men. But you remember
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:48.280]   what he says about it afterwards? After he came to see himself and saw the Lord and was
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:55.560]   convicted of sin, what does he say about it? He says, "I count it as done and lost."
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:00.840]   Now that's very strong language, isn't it? But it's perfectly accurate. This self-same
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.720]   man, when he saw that righteousness, that religious righteousness, that morality of
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:12.280]   his, and he'd done it very thoroughly, when he saw that in the sight of God, he said,
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:19.360]   "Look, this is done, it's refuse, it's vile, it's foul, it's putrefaction."
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.800]   He doesn't throw words like that about without considering what he's saying. He didn't
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:29.040]   just say, you know, that it wasn't quite good enough. He says, "It's all wrong,
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:38.920]   it's very ragged, done and refuse and complete loss."
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:46.680]   You see, this is what we may call the prolegomenon, if you like, to the gospel. It's this sort
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:52.040]   of thing that makes the gospel of Christ so glorious. It's this sort of thing that necessitated
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:57.080]   the incarnation and the death upon the cross. Man doesn't need simply to be improved a
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:03.320]   little or to be helped. He's as vile and as hopeless as this, nothing less. So let
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:09.720]   us, I say, take time with these descriptions, terrible and awful though they are, and hateful
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:15.280]   though they are, they're true, and they're true of every one of us by nature.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.520]   And then that brings me to the last thing under this particular heading. "There is
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:28.880]   none that doeth good." And then, for the sake of the self-righteous repetition, "There
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:41.480]   is none that doeth good." No, not one. Again, you see, this is goodness in God's
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:48.200]   sight. And it's here I say so many good people go astray and have never seen the need
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.920]   of the death of Christ, they've never really seen the need of forgiveness at all. They're
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:58.120]   doing so much good. But the apostle said, "There is none that doeth good." Not one.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:04.200]   Again, I say it's goodness in God's sight, not in men's sight.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:09.440]   Once more, let me therefore interpret it to you like this. Why is this true about all
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:16.320]   the natural men's goodness? Well, this is the answer. All the natural men's goodness
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:22.840]   is invariably self-centered. But you see, he doesn't do everything for himself. He
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.880]   may be very kind to others. Yes, but while he's being kind to others, he is really
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   being very kind to himself also. He is doing it to please himself more than he is to please
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:39.040]   them. Men's actions, every one of them, are polluted at the source. Sin is in control,
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.440]   it vitiates everything. So all our actions are self-centered. There is no such thing
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:50.240]   as a disinterested action in the natural sinful men.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:57.160]   What is goodness? Well, goodness really means to do things for the glory of God. And your
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:01.800]   naturally good men does not do things for the glory of God. He doesn't think of God.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:07.920]   He is doing it entirely for his own glory. That is why it's useless, it's not good.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:16.520]   The test of doing good, I say, is this element of God's glory. And of course, you can very
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:21.360]   easily prove that. You may have to be just a little bit brutal, but you have to do it
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:25.920]   sometimes to convict people of sin. You try one of these good people of the world next
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.840]   time and you put some questions to them or query their goodness and they'll very soon
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:36.240]   show you by their reaction of annoyance and perhaps temper, that after all it was entirely
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:42.920]   self-centered and self-interested. No such thing as a disinterested action in a sinful
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.400]   man. It doesn't come up to God's standard.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:54.480]   Now lest anybody may think that I am going too far or that the Apostle Paul went too
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:07.800]   far, listen to the Son of God saying it, "Ye are they that justify yourselves before men,
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:18.240]   but God seeth the heart, for that which is highly esteemed amongst men is abomination
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:23.160]   in the sight of God." Do you know that's worse than dung and refuse? That's worse
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:33.080]   than this curdled milk. Abomination! In the sight of God, he hates it. All this natural
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:38.200]   goodness that gets such prominence in the newspapers and that people talk about so much
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:45.360]   and praise one another so much for, all that in the sight of God is abomination. He hates
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:53.680]   it all because he sees the heart and he sees that it's all polluted at the very source.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:31:03.040]   Well then, there is our first section. But the Apostle doesn't leave it at that and
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:08.840]   he doesn't leave us at that. That is the general description.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:14.680]   Now we move on to the second section in which we have the particular description. Or if
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:20.400]   you prefer it, you can put it like this, the manifestations of all this. Because man under
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:26.520]   sin is like this, well how does he behave? What's it like in operation? Well, the section
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:33.080]   runs from verse 13 to verse 17, but again we can subdivide it quite simply. First section,
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:46.520]   sin in words, verses 13 and 14. Are you ready for it, my friends? I'm going to hold before
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.640]   you this evening the most terrifying mirror that you've ever looked into in your life.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.400]   I warn you now, if you want to be on good terms with yourself, you'd better go out
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:32:07.360]   at this minute. Here's the mirror. Sin, first of all, as it shows itself in words.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:15.400]   How terrible, how graphic is this description. Their throat, he starts there, their throat
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:22.120]   is an open sepulcher. That's his quotation at this point from the Old Testament. What's
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:30.000]   that mean? Well, it means this. It's almost too offensive a description to mention, but
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:38.120]   here it is. We've got to expand the scripture. It's as if you opened a grave into which
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:43.520]   a body had been buried two or three weeks ago, and the process of putrefaction is at
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:56.280]   its height. And the smell, the stench is beyond description, foul and offensive. That's
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:03.280]   the condition of the throat of the men under sin, the natural men without the grace of
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:10.440]   the Lord Jesus Christ. Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh. And because
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.800]   the heart is as we've seen it to be, that's the sort of thing that emanates and comes
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:21.920]   out. But let me go on. With their tongues they have used deceit. What does this mean?
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:31.600]   Well, the original means that their tongues are very smooth. Smooth tongue, speaking falsehoods
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:39.520]   and flatteries and lies, pretending that which isn't true, pretending to be delighted to
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.160]   meet people when you wish you hadn't seen them, pretending you think they're well to
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:53.200]   them when you're always criticizing them. Tongues have used deceit. They seem so wonderful,
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:34:00.680]   the words were so full of honey as it were, but it's all done for a purpose. Now, I've
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:07.480]   often said this from this pulpit, I must say it again. What really baffles me is how any
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:15.640]   man reading the Scriptures mustn't see that of necessity it's the Word of God. Can you
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:20.640]   give me a more perfect description of society and the life of society today than this sort
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:25.040]   of thing? Look at them in their ballrooms or on their great state occasions or at their
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:29.040]   dinners. How friendly and affable they all seem with one another, and they're muttering
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.360]   things to one another the moment the other turns their back. Isn't it true? Well, you
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:38.560]   see, that's why the gossip columns of the newspapers are so flourishing and they're
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:44.520]   so interesting. The secrets are let out, and all the rivalries and the jealousies, and
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.960]   yet you see them smiling at one another as if they were really very fond of one another.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:55.680]   That's life, that's society in its evening dress as well as in its rags in the gutter.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:01.560]   How true it is. But wait a minute, there's worse to follow. Their tongues are so smooth
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:09.480]   and with their tongues they have used deceit. But the poison of asps is under their lips.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:17.440]   The Apostle Gershows shows that the Old Testament writers had this amazing detailed knowledge
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:25.000]   of the asp, the adder, the serpent, full of venom as it is. Now how does it work? Well,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.680]   it's a very fine description, this in a zoological sense. It is true, you know, of
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:39.760]   the adder, of the viper, which is so harmful and which so poisons us, that the poison is
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:47.200]   concealed in a little bag which is there at the root of the lips and which works like
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:54.240]   this. There is the little bag. Under the upper jaw of the adder there are some fangs which
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.760]   are lying in a horizontal position. But when the adder is about to pounce upon a victim
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:06.000]   he puts back his head. As he does that, these teeth or fangs drop down. He bites the victim
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.320]   and as he is biting with the fangs, one of the fangs presses the bag that's full of
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:17.440]   poison so that into the wound is injected this venom, this poison that is going to kill
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:27.600]   the victim. It's an exact scientific description as to how the adder kills thus by means of
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:36.280]   his poison. And according to the scriptures, that's the truth about men who speaks with
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:45.760]   such a smooth tongue. But under the lips is this venom, this poison, this rancour, honey
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:55.560]   on the lips, poison under them. This comes out of course, as I say in conversation, the
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:02.040]   poison comes out in entertainment, seems so wonderful, but it poisons the minds and the
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:08.840]   imaginations of the young people. It leads them eventually to hell. Oh, look at the advertisement,
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:14.960]   so wonderful. But there's poison there. The tongue is smooth, calm, they say, come
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.720]   and enjoy this, how marvelous, how wonderful. And the innocent victim doesn't see the
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:25.760]   bag with the poison which is suddenly injected when they're bitten. And it leads, I say,
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:33.440]   to destruction and to hell. It's the same of wrong teaching. People would regard this
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:38.720]   sort of evangelical preaching as unpleasant. People often say that about my preaching.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:44.280]   Too hard, they say, too harsh, it's unpleasant. Let me listen to somebody who's always talking
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:51.120]   about love and about the love of God. Ah, how smooth his tongue is. But you believe
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:56.680]   that other which is no gospel and which is always praising you and praising your world
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:02.520]   and calls it a beautiful world and says that man is wonderful and says that all is well
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.640]   and that there's no need of the blood of Christ. You believe it, and I say it will
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:15.800]   inject into you this poison that will damn your soul and send you to hell. Their tongues
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:27.040]   are smooth, but under their lips is this poison of adders, the false teaching that sends people
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:37.240]   to sleep and gives them that false exhilaration and finally ruins and destroys the soul. But
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:45.520]   there's one other word I've got to add because it's here in my text, whose mouth
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:56.760]   is full of cursing and bitterness. Now we must be clear about these things. He
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:06.240]   doesn't mean by that that every individual curses and swears as much as he can. No, no.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:12.600]   But he does say that this cursing and bitterness are there in all and we're all guilty of
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:18.880]   it and have been. And you will simply to listen to the things that people say when they're
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:26.840]   off guard and what they say about one another, and you'll hear the curse and you'll hear
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:34.480]   the bitterness. You remember Job's wife, don't you? When things went wrong, she said,
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:43.240]   "Look here, you're a fool. Curse God and die." And there are people when things
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:48.800]   go wrong, they put it like this, "Why should this happen to me and to my child?" And
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:54.800]   they've cursed God as they've said it. That's the way you curse God. When you have
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:40:01.000]   a bitter feeling against him, I want to ask you a question. It's cursing God. And the
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:11.760]   whole of humanity in sin is guilty of cursing God and cursing others. And this bitterness,
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:22.080]   oaths and cursing and swearing and unkind and bitter and revengeful and reproachful
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:29.680]   language. You see, my friends, the Scripture says that
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:36.040]   all this is true about us all as a result of the fallen sin, and that is why it devotes
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:41.880]   so much attention to these things. You go through your New Testament epistles and you'll
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:47.760]   find that a great apostle like the apostle Paul, having handled his mighty doctrine in
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:54.600]   the epistle to the Ephesians, for example, comes down at the end and says, "No more
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:41:02.200]   lying, no more filthy talking and jesting." He comes down to particulars because, you
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:06.960]   see, sin expresses itself in this way. And the apostle James writes a whole chapter practically
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.640]   on the tongue and of the use of the tongue. Read the third chapter of James' epistle.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:16.000]   It's all about this terrible thing, this little organ that we've been talking about
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.600]   that's got the fire of hell in it, he says. It's like the rodder that turns the whole
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:28.240]   ship. And he talks about this fountain which emits horrible bitterness and terrible things.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:39.600]   Well, here it is. Our time has gone again. Or perhaps you'll wait and let me try to
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:46.440]   finish off this particular section. Verses 15 to 17, "Sin in deeds." For me to end
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:52.600]   this picture. What does he say? Well, here it is. We've seen it in words, we now look
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:57.960]   at it in deeds. Their feet are swift to shed blood. I needn't keep you. That doesn't
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:03.240]   mean that every human being is a murderer. No, no. But this thing is there. And mankind,
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:12.320]   humanity, is ever shedding blood. Wars and strife. What else? The next thing is this.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:16.860]   Destruction and misery are in their ways. Now, I know of no more perfect description
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:22.600]   of the world as it is today than just that. It's a summary of history. Here is history.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:29.200]   Destruction and misery. Desolations leading to misery. Bruising and wretchedness following
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:37.880]   cause and effect. Isn't that a perfect description of history? What fools men are to boast of
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:46.480]   wars and to boast of conquests, as if wars make a nation great. There you see the perversion
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:53.280]   of sin. Glorifying the number of people that have been killed. How horrible it is. Destruction
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:02.280]   and misery. All that but leads, you see, always to unhappiness and to wretchedness. Sin is
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:12.840]   essentially destructive. It always destroys. It destroys character, our own characters,
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:18.440]   our people's characters. And it always leads to misery. Look at the destructiveness of
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:22.920]   drunkenness and the misery to which it leads. Look at the destructiveness of vice and the
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:27.320]   misery and wretchedness to which it leads. Look at the destructiveness of war and the
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:31.680]   wretchedness and misery to which it leads. Greed, avarice, all these things, they're
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:38.840]   all destructive. And they take with them in their train wretchedness and desolation. Ruins,
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:48.920]   the bombed cities, the ruination of souls. What a description of sin. How true it is.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:56.440]   History is rarely summarized, as I say, in these two words. Destruction, devastation,
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:02.840]   and misery are in all their ways. And finally, the ways of peace have they not known? Here
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.920]   he puts it the other way around, you see. Because they've known destruction and misery,
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:15.400]   they haven't known peace. And why haven't they known peace? Well, it's because of the
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:20.600]   thing with which we started tonight. It's because they haven't got wisdom. Because you
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:28.160]   remember as we read in Proverbs 3, 17, her ways, the ways of wisdom, are ways of pleasantness.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:35.840]   And all her paths are peace. But if you haven't got this wisdom, you won't have the peace.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:46.520]   Because God has said, "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked." Well, there,
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:51.520]   we leave it at that. We've ended the second section. It leaves us with verse 18, which
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:58.960]   is the third section in which he gives us the explanation of all the rest.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:08.360]   Now as we leave one another this evening, I do trust that we've all seen more clearly
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:20.360]   than we have ever seen in our lives before, the absolute necessity of God's way of salvation.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:28.280]   Before a single individual could ever be saved, what we have been going through in detail
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:37.720]   is nothing but the simple, literal, stark truth of every single one of us by nature.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:43.560]   No, no, you're not an exception, my friend. There is no exception to this. You are not
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:52.840]   a nice person. There is no such thing. These horrors are in every one of us. Every one
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:46:03.240]   of us. There is no exception. We are all together lost. We are dead in trespasses and sins,
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:10.960]   and the grave is putrefying and foul. As the apostle puts it in writing to Titus, "We
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:21.480]   were all once hateful and hating one another." Let me put it like this. If you do not accept
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:28.520]   this description of yourself apart from the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, well, there's
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:34.760]   no need to argue about it. You're just not a Christian. If you resent all this, you are
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:39.440]   not a Christian. You are not yet convinced and convicted of sin, and you are not a believer
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:46.440]   in Christ, though you thought you were. If you in any way object to this, you are automatically
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:55.480]   putting yourself outside the kingdom of God and the Christian fold. It's the truth, the
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:08.960]   simple truth, the horrible truth. That is what sin has brought us to. But thank God,
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:14.520]   there is a way out of it all. And it is the way that the apostle is going on to expound
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:22.720]   and to unfold. But no man will look for it or clutch at it, except the man who has seen
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:31.600]   his terrifying need of it. May God, therefore, convict us by the Holy Spirit, if we've never
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:41.960]   been convicted before, to see what we are. By nature, children of wrath, even as all
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:49.000]   others. Amen.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
