[00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.120]   I want to show one more thing just same as the screen before but this time I have
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.120]   debug symbols on and I have introduced a bug into this thing which is a logic
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.960]   bug right so this this here should be a B it's an A and what I did this time is I
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.400]   had Claude create like I wanted to use tmux instead of screen and I just had
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.140]   it auto create an agent so all that said is like hey there's a debug agent that
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.860]   uses tmux and LLB within tmux right so let's see if this does also do a good
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.880]   job because I haven't actually used tmux before but I think it might do a slightly
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.480]   better job because tmux is terminal interface is quite better so let's see
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.360]   the program in this folder has a bug it should give us the top-end results but
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:07.220]   it doesn't I want you to debug this with LLDB and then also explain to me exactly
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:19.440]   what the bug is okay let's see if it can do that and I also want to
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:38.180]   it's already found a bug oh well I think this is exactly where the bug is let's see what
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:51.140]   I can't see line 10 yeah of course but look it should it should now still use LLDB so let's see if
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:02:02.480]   if we can watch it do it stuff one of the things why I think these kind of things are quite nice is
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.820]   because like it is able to remote control a program but you also have a way to watch it as it's doing
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.420]   right so you can learn a little bit about how it uses debuggers and that's kind of what I like about this
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:23.420]   approach with its remote control programs is if the text programs that you can also use and use something like tmux
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.300]   then there's a way for you to see how it does it and then you can you also learn for yourself a little bit
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:42.300]   what's going on here right so step down I think it clearly already has a theory that a and b are the same just from
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.300]   looking at the code earlier because it also put a breakpoint right on that function
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:58.300]   but you can learn a little bit of like how it uses a debugger right and because I told it to explain to me what's
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.820]   happens afterwards I think what it might actually do is it might actually run extra commands here now to
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:11.560]   to give me all the output so it's doing more than it needs to I think because I asked it for the
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.080]   explanation and sometimes when these subagents run they write out this markdown files as a form of
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.220]   communication and so my suspicion is we're going to get a markdown file at the end that explains all of
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:37.120]   this but let's see one thing that the fact that it sleeps one second all the time is kind of annoying I wonder if I can
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.420]   give it something that sleeps a little bit less or even maybe not even sleep at all
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.420]   that's that's definitely one of the things that I wish these tools would be better it's like they should really have a better
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.900]   to evade events then just to sleep randomly but well
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.040]   that it is what it is
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.600]   so
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.880]   I think it's probably done with tmux now is my guess but I'm not sure maybe it tries one more thing but
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.500]   clearly it's done with the session so it's done with the session so it ended it
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.580]   now it's also reading
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.420]   it's running the program once without LDB
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.920]   I think just because it wants to
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.800]   not sure why I wanted to run it once more but I think maybe just to
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.440]   write out this explanation and so now it's going to explain us the exact nature of the bug
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:53.000]   and so did it write a file no it only wrote it here so the bug is in word count
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.300]   should be entry B what's wrong
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:08.940]   but for me the point is mostly hey this is able to remotely control a tmux session and I think that's pretty cool
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:38.920]   For more information, visit www.fema.org
