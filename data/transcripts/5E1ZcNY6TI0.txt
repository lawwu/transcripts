[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.820]   There's a question I've been wanting to ask you since we started.
[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.540]   And I thought about coming in here and I've been thinking about it in the weeks ahead
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.540]   of this.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.120]   And I'm gonna just come clean and say I don't exactly know how to ask the question.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.600]   So it's about relationships.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.120]   Oh, do it man.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:26.160]   So I know in myself that my discipline is much higher when it's just me, but that's
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.440]   because I had certain things early on, but then I was a terrible student, barely finished
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.440]   high school.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.840]   But then when I got serious, I got serious, but I did that by staying away from everybody.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.920]   And anyone who's ever had a relationship of any kind, but in particular, romantic relationships
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.840]   knows that yes, you can derive tremendous support from those.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.040]   Like you got this baby, you can go in and you're like, yeah, I got this.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.960]   She said, I got this, you know.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.800]   It's great to finish something and share with someone, share a meal, you know, get the hug.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.300]   But there's another side to all of that that I'd like to learn more about from you, which
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.320]   is there's a warm body next to you in bed in the morning.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.580]   You don't want to get up.
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.680]   They also have needs.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.960]   You've got your mission that people sometimes need things from us.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.840]   But also oftentimes the people that love us most, that truly love us and that want to
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.520]   support us, don't understand this thing.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.360]   And they're the first people to tell us like, listen, take a day off.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.320]   And then this whole cycle, at least in my head goes off, like you just want a vacation.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.440]   And then it's almost like a paranoia.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.280]   I'm not saying anything nice about myself right now.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.280]   Right.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.280]   Oh, good.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.920]   Former girlfriends are gonna be like, yeah, like, you know, they remember that.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.480]   And so support of people close to you is critical.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.060]   This could be friends, could be romantic partners, whatever.
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.500]   But they're also, the knife cuts both ways.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.760]   It can be the thing that can really undermine this thing that you're talking about, because
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.360]   the people that care about us also want to see us comfortable.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.360]   Right.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.360]   They want to see us happy.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.360]   They want to see us peaceful.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.280]   They want to see us wake up from a great night's sleep.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.760]   And they want things too.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.760]   Right.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.000]   So how do you untangle that whole bit?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.160]   Well, it's funny, man.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.560]   I'm unbalanced, but I'm mostly unbalanced towards the family side.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.700]   People don't get about me.
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.700]   I start being unbalanced.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.260]   I get all my stuff in.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.200]   But what I do is I make sure that my family has everything they need.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.280]   Everything they need.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.760]   Those who want to be part of my family.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.760]   Some don't.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.960]   Some family members don't want to be part of David Goggins.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.960]   I get it.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.960]   I got it.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.120]   That's life.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.160]   Those who are part of my family, I give them everything they need so they can leave me
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.780]   the fuck alone.
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.880]   I make sure you're happy as fuck because I got to go to work.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.660]   And I don't mean smoke jumping.
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.480]   I don't mean running.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.560]   I mean all of it.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560]   It takes every...
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.320]   I can't have you in my fucking shit.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.560]   Can't.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.000]   So I know for me to have a family, I got to make sure that you realize I'm going to give
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   you everything you need.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.720]   So when you start bitching at me, I'm going to say, "Look, hang on.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.080]   I dedicated my life to give you everything you need.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.160]   I need this time right here for me to be the best I can be because this journey started
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.040]   without anybody."
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.880]   And I make sure everybody knows that because in my life, I've been left...
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.440]   Think about it.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.800]   I was left alone at a young age to figure this shit out.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.860]   I figured it out for myself and it's been very successful for myself.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.840]   No one's going to come in here and fuck with my shit.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.920]   That's why I make sure I will take care of whatever you need.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.080]   Whatever you need from me, you got it.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.360]   Money, house, my love, my support, I'm going to give you everything you need.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.760]   That said, I do it the highest level possible and I'm saying it with Jennifer in the next
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.760]   room.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.760]   So please come in and say something.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760]   If it's wrong, Jennifer, I don't give a fuck.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.800]   Say what you got to say.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.680]   So then when it's time for me to go to work, I expect you to do the same for me because
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.160]   it takes every bit of me to do what I have to do.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.680]   So I make sure that I'm very unbalanced for my family so I can be exactly that unbalanced
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.920]   for myself and that's how I do it.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.080]   I let people know right up front, I'm not what you want in a man.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.080]   I guarantee that.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.280]   There's going to be a lot of late nights, a lot of early mornings, a lot of times where
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.640]   I got to be by myself thinking about the process that is next in my mind.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.600]   I can't have aggravation, I can't have this, I can't have that.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.440]   There's a lot of things, but I let them know up front.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.080]   I'm very vocal about that.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.360]   Sometimes relationships work for me, sometimes they didn't, but that's who I am.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.480]   One thing I did wrong in my life was I tried for so many years to please people and I did
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.020]   it at the expense of myself.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.600]   I was leaving a lot in the tank and when you do that, you stop living, but the person in
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.620]   your life is happy as fuck because you're giving them everything they want.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.320]   Your life is full, but you feel empty and that's not a relationship to me.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:22.320]   For me, it's important that you know exactly who I am because this is what life made and
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.560]   I'm not trying to change it because I just figured it out.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   I'm not trying to compromise David Goggins.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.400]   I will never, ever compromise David Goggins.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.300]   That doesn't mean I won't give you what you need and what you want and what you desire,
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.560]   but I don't need money, I don't need fame, I don't need shit, so I give it all away.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:52.380]   What I do need is to make sure that that willpower is worked on every fucking day and every night
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.860]   for the rest of my life because that's the one thing that's going to keep me feeding
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.540]   you, keeping you where you need to be because once that willpower is gone, 300 pound David
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.180]   Goggins, he may not look like it, but I will walk around with it.
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.140]   So the things that are important to you in life, you must do always or you're nobody
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.180]   and that's how I handle relationships.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.680]   Amen to that.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.380]   Something I could personally work on is that upfront clear communication because it resonates
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.540]   that feeling of like there's something inside that's not getting worked out that when I'm
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.900]   on my own, it's a lot easier, but then of course, wanting relationships and family,
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.500]   I think that's a healthy part of being human too.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.980]   Obviously you've worked it out, so I appreciate you sharing that.
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.060]   I don't think I've ever heard you talk about it that way before.
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.260]   No, people are scared of that, man.
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.900]   People are scared of that conversation with their wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend,
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.380]   but why are you scared of it?
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:57.180]   Why are you scared to tell a motherfucker, your wife, your husband, who you are?
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.380]   Who you are, exactly who you are.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.620]   And that was a problem I had.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.260]   That's a problem that a lot of us have in life.
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.240]   No one knows who you really are.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.260]   No one knew who I really was.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.460]   I went to a school where there were a lot of black kids.
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.060]   A lot of black kids didn't want to be in special ops.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.940]   I never talked about special ops to black kids.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:18.940]   Why?
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.020]   I was wondering what, I'm not going to fit in.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.020]   That's not what they do.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.520]   A lot of black kids don't do that kind of shit.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.060]   Whatever I wanted to do, no one really knew the real me growing up because I never wanted
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.820]   anybody to know the real me.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.840]   I was always afraid of what you might say or how you're going to feel or whatever.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.220]   You got feelings.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.820]   You have a life that you have to live.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.740]   So it's important that whatever's on your mind, you let that person know.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.620]   Therefore, you're giving them the option to be with you or not.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.620]   This is who I am.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.540]   If you don't like it, that's good, man.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.540]   I got it.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.820]   But this is David Goggins.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.860]   So that honest conversation is very important, man, so everybody knows where they stand.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.660]   That person may not be for you, and that's all good.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:13.660]   [Music]
