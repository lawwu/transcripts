[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.120]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.880]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.060]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.760]   Just recently on a Friday Q&A show, I had a caller who called in and asked what I thought
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.640]   about the idea of joining the military reserves, the army reserves, or the National Guard with
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.920]   the goal of gaining some experience, with the goal of having his career enhanced by
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.920]   joining that.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.760]   I gave my opinion, which was a quite vigorous and strong no, that I didn't think it was
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.760]   a great idea.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.880]   A listener named Brian chimed in and said, "Whoa, I think, Joshua, you made a few decent
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.800]   points, but I think there's more to the story, especially in that situation.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.320]   Joshua, I think you missed a few important things."
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.480]   I wanted to bring him on and give him a chance to talk about it so we can give better, more
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.360]   fully rounded out advice.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.360]   Brian, welcome to the show.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.360]   I'm glad you're here today.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.920]   Hi, thank you for having me.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.440]   Just a quick background.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.080]   I've been in for almost 20 years now.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.000]   I've done multiple different components.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.800]   The army is made up of three different components, the active duty that everyone knows, the reserves,
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.920]   which is a federal reserve force, and then the National Guard, which are primarily state
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.160]   military forces.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.000]   I've spent time in both the active component and the National Guard of the state, and in
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.520]   full time and part time capacity.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.560]   You feel like this has been a helpful experience for you, and you think that it's actually
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.960]   a very strong and valuable thing to consider.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.240]   Tell me more.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.000]   I think it can be very valuable and useful depending on what exactly you're looking for
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.600]   and what you're trying to get out of your military service.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.640]   If you just want money for college and you're trying to do the least amount possible to
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.360]   just get access to federal benefits, yeah, there are other ways to do it other than the
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.360]   military.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.680]   That doesn't mean that you can't do it, but that might not be the best motivation for
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.880]   entering service, like you said.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.600]   If you want to work in particular areas where it is difficult or illegal to do so in a civilian
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   capacity, then there are certainly options that are available to you through military
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.720]   or federal service that are not available to those who are not part of that service.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.280]   What would be some examples?
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.200]   I work at—oh, sorry, go ahead.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.720]   No, what would be some examples of things where you literally couldn't get the job if
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.240]   you weren't involved in the National Guard or the military reserves?
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.160]   Some of these areas include, particularly, fields where you need security clearances.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.080]   Those are very difficult to get outside of military service.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.760]   It's not impossible, but it is certainly more difficult and more time consuming.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.360]   It is far easier if you're looking to work in a field that deals with classified information
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.000]   to do that via your military affiliation first.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.280]   The colleague that was a defense contractor, I don't know exactly what he does, but if
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.560]   he has a need or an area where he would like to work in a certain field, or he needs a
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.800]   different or upgraded version of a security clearance, it will be much easier to do that
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.320]   through a military affiliation than through your private contractor affiliation because
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.320]   it costs them a lot of money.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.200]   If you're doing it through your military affiliation, it's much, much easier.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.760]   That's a pretty niche application, but it is one of the circumstances that could affect
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.760]   that caller individually.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.080]   Yeah, and because he mentioned—that caller mentioned that he was already working as a
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.400]   defense contractor, that could be a very important detail for his personal situation.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.960]   How else have you personally benefited significantly by your involvement with the National—with,
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.520]   let's see, Military Reserve and active duty?
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.760]   So from a personal perspective, I should have started off with all opinions expressed are
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.960]   my own personal opinions.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.040]   They do not represent the views or positions of the Army, the National Guard, or the Department
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.280]   of Defense in any way.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.120]   So from my own personal point of view, I have found the mission and the work that we get
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.320]   to do to be much more satisfying than what I did in the private sector.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.040]   So I did active duty for a while.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.720]   I got out because I was a frustrated junior officer, much like Mr. Reid.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.240]   I did make sure to go back and read some of his articles.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.960]   And I got a good paying private job.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.840]   I was actually a supply chain manager of a large facility.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.440]   I was making good money, but I did not find the job filling.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.920]   I didn't find making money for other people and working that nine-to-five job to be meaningful
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.760]   enough.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.680]   So after several years of doing that, I looked for ways to get back into doing the military
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.760]   on a full-time basis again.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.760]   That money was fine.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.400]   It just wasn't fulfilling.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.600]   I definitely prefer the fields where the work that you're doing has impacts on a national
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.520]   or international scale.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.960]   And that's something I find hard to do through the private sector.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.120]   Again, that's not going to impact most people, but I have found that work to be much more
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.120]   satisfying.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.560]   >>Steve: So obviously I said some pretty things that could be inflammatory with regard to
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.000]   the mission, the activities of many of the branches of the military, my frustration with
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.640]   military actions around the world, undeclared wars, questionable moral foundations for some
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.280]   of the wars, etc.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.680]   So my goal was not to be inflammatory with those things, obviously, but to state my perspective.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.040]   But I think there is—but you, however, you feel like there is a higher purpose.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:46.640]   You're gaining a significant sense of satisfaction from your work, and that's actually actively
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.240]   why you chose to go back into the armed forces.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.240]   Is that right?
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.240]   >>Jaymee Yes.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.880]   And your positions, I don't think you're inaccurate.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.800]   I mean, there have been many undeclared wars.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.200]   They've all been undeclared wars.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:08.080]   In a blue sky scenario, I would much rather have Congress reassert its authority to declare
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080]   war.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.320]   And if we're talking blue sky, then yes, I would also prefer a very small standing army
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.560]   with minimal—and the U.S. has minimal overseas commitments compared to what we do now.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.740]   But we can't snap our fingers and make that happen, and we are in the world that we are.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:32.500]   And in that world, there are lots of places that being in the service allows you to impact
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.660]   things that you can't do from the outside as well.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.580]   You see in the news different events going on in Ukraine and China and other places,
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.740]   and you get to have some impact, depending on your job, in how those events play out
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:52.220]   and how you inform the leadership that does exist in the military and the political classes
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.820]   and helps inform their decisions that they make.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.140]   And hopefully, you can turn some of those decisions to be better than they would if
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.660]   you were not participating in that situation.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.660]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:07.260]   No, there's no question that—and this is kind of the classic moral conundrum, and
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.500]   I'm trying to be careful here.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.380]   You're welcome to say anything that you would like to say publicly.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.980]   I'm trying to be careful in a public context not to ask you too many questions along these
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.940]   lines that could just potentially be difficult for you.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.340]   But again, you're welcome to share any opinions that you have.
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:31.940]   The thought that I have on it is certainly, you want the good guys to be involved.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:40.820]   And so if you take the tack that I advocated, which was basically to abandon the "don't
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:46.780]   go and be involved in the military," then there is a risk that the entire organization
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:54.940]   is abandoned to people who may not have our best interests at heart.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.260]   So that's always a risk.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:01.740]   The problem is, I guess, it's always a judgment of where are we in that cycle, right?
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.540]   Is this a redeemable organism?
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.060]   Same thing happens in any company, any church, any relationship, right?
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:14.300]   You look at it and you say, "Okay, I can be involved here, and is there an opportunity
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.820]   for me to make a difference in a positive direction?"
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.360]   But I'm not sure.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.660]   And so sometimes you just simply walk away.
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.260]   Sometimes you stay and you fight.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.100]   And obviously, that's a personal assessment that everyone has to make.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.900]   And you and I would probably make different assessments.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.060]   You're saying, "I believe I can impact things properly here."
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.120]   And from an outside perspective, my having zero experience inside the trenches, I'm looking
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.180]   at it and saying, "I'm glad you're there.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.300]   I'm glad you're there.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:49.780]   And I want to be faithful to raise as many good questions as I can so that you and others
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.700]   who are involved on the inside will look at it."
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:59.140]   But I look at it and I just don't see how the inertia seems too strong to me.
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.540]   So that's, I guess, just a difference in judgment.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:06.100]   Do you want to comment on anything I said there or add any personal opinions on those
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.380]   moral quandaries that I talked about?
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:14.500]   Well, just to start with, I don't find what you're saying to be inflammatory in terms
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.900]   of your positions.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:21.180]   There are examples of everything you've said that mostly, largely accurate.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.060]   There are, the military is made up of humans.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.540]   Humans do good and bad things.
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:30.880]   There's no universal brush that says all military folks are all heroes and they never do wrong
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.020]   and they should never be questioned.
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.220]   I don't agree with that.
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.700]   And I don't think most people in uniform would agree with that.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:41.140]   So it's perfectly okay to have positions that are not 100% raw, raw support groups.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.500]   I don't think that's a bad thing at all.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.500]   That's fair.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.500]   That's fair.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.500]   And I appreciate that.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:53.660]   So with regard to other benefits, what other, so I actually, after I answered that question,
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.260]   that was a spontaneous response.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.660]   One of the things that I have admired over the years, I have thought that even from the
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:08.300]   perspective of early retirement, the military, and I guess the more traditional way that
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.700]   the pensions are structured, et cetera, can provide a remarkable foundation for the right
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.700]   people.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.900]   I have outlines in my notes of a show that I've never done, but basically how to use
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.740]   the military for the purposes of basically building a foundation under yourself.
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.680]   So join active duty as young as possible.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.300]   You're getting training, et cetera.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.060]   You have your housing expenses paid for.
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.580]   You have a very interesting job for the right personality.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.780]   I personally think I would love to be in the military in terms of sense of camaraderie,
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:45.180]   working with my buddies towards a common project, all working together.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:52.180]   And so you have in many ways a very rewarding job mixed with a unique set of benefits, financial
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:59.420]   benefits, pension benefits, access to other programs like VA programs, lifelong health
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.420]   care, et cetera.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.960]   I think there are some compelling ways that you could structure that kind of approach
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.700]   and use it very well.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:13.620]   Comment and give my listener that was considering, give him the strong case of ways that you've
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:19.660]   benefited by that and how he might benefit from considering joining even the Guard or
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.660]   the reserves.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:26.940]   Well, if you want to go with a just straight financial calculations, and I know you've
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.260]   done the math on what a military retirement is worth, depending if you come in as an enlisted
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:37.620]   member or an officer, your pension figure is well in excess of seven figures between
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.140]   the time that you're likely to retire and the amount that you're likely to collect before
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.580]   you pass away.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:48.260]   And following that, half of it transfers then to your spouse who is, you know, women are
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.700]   on average, it's more likely to be a man joining the military.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.620]   And on average, most women outlive men.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.820]   So your spouse is then taken care of with a half of your pension until they pass away.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:04.580]   So from just a strictly retirement or remuneration, it is very, very valuable.
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:10.300]   Beyond that, by and large, we are well compensated for the most grades and most locations at
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.100]   this point, grade being your rank in the military.
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:20.460]   At this point, I am a more senior officer, and I feel that I am quite well compensated
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.220]   for my position at this point.
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:29.140]   And most folks along the way, junior folks do definitely have a tighter budget, no doubt
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.140]   about that.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.420]   We've all been there.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.060]   But for the most part, your day to day monthly pay is quite good.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.500]   You have a housing allowance, you have a food allowance.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.340]   If you're an enlisted member, there's a clothing allowance to help pay for uniform and equipment
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.600]   costs.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.580]   Those benefits are quite valuable.
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.980]   On top of that, like you said, there are many other benefits, including education is always
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.660]   a big driver.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.540]   So you've got what's called federal tuition assistance, which will pay for classes while
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.440]   you're in uniform and you can go to school at nights.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.700]   If you get out, you then have new GI Bill, which is very, very generous.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:08.660]   That includes full tuition at schools and basically a stipend to cover living expenses.
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.380]   It's called a modified BAH percentage.
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.420]   So all that is quite valuable.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.300]   And then from an insurance perspective, again, very valuable.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:23.620]   I'll talk about it from a traditional drilling guardsman perspective for a second.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:28.020]   You can get private health care through your employer because as a drilling reservist or
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:33.060]   guards member, you're only performing about one drill per week, one weekend per month
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.060]   ish.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.020]   I know that's heavy on the ish because there are some additional commitments that can come
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.580]   into play as well.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.860]   But you can purchase that health insurance through your private employer and pay the
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.420]   full private rate for that.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:52.220]   Or you can purchase what's called a tri-care reserve select plan, which is now I don't
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.300]   have the figures in front of me.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.940]   So forgive me because I'm sure they're going to be slightly off, but around $200 to $250
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:03.020]   a month for full family coverage, which is a pretty darn economical choice.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.660]   And there's a lot more like that.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:12.260]   But those are some of the major incentives monetarily that do draw people into service.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:19.220]   - If you were going to choose to get out, what would be the things that would drive
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.020]   you personally out?
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.060]   What are those things that are at the back of your head where you think, "Okay, listen,
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.660]   I can deal with this, but this does kind of bother me.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.260]   And if this became worse, this is one of those things that would cause me to choose not to
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.060]   re-up my enlistment."
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:41.860]   - So I'm actually an officer, so we don't have enlistment contracts.
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.700]   You're free to go mostly when you want.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.080]   I mean, you got to give some notice and get your release orders, but you pretty much can
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.060]   go when you want.
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:56.220]   Enlisted members do sign contracts, which do last a specified amount of time.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:00.780]   Some of the things that would bother me would depend on what our military is being used
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.340]   for domestically more than anything.
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.540]   Now being in the Guard, we do lots of domestic response missions, most of which are quite
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.740]   positive.
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.180]   We respond to wildfires and hurricanes.
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.580]   And I mean, from my day job, we help coordinate some of those things.
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:22.060]   And I've got pictures of our helicopters pulling people out of a lake when everything around
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.340]   them is on fire to save people.
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.500]   And so there's a lot of good work that happens like that.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:33.540]   But if politicians start trying to use those military assets in politically motivated ways,
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.380]   that would definitely be something that would be more or less a red line for myself and
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.380]   many others.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.300]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.100]   Last question I have, and then I'll just give you an open floor to say anything else that
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.740]   you want to say as we wrap this up.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.100]   Last question I have is this.
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:54.660]   Is it true, so if I sign up, and I appreciate your clarification, I did not know that officers
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:59.860]   did not have contracts in the same way that enlisted men do.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:05.660]   But is it the case that if I were to join, say, the National Guard, which for me was
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:06.660]   attractive, right?
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.660]   When I looked at it, I didn't pursue it, but I looked at it and I thought, "Ah, I would
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.220]   love to do this," when I was in my early 20s.
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.420]   If I were to join the National Guard, and if I were to join as an enlisted man, and
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:27.220]   I would have a contract, if I'm called up, including if I'm called up to go into combat,
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.260]   that I have committed myself to do that, right?
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.900]   I don't have an escape clause.
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.580]   I don't have an out.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:38.060]   And so I don't get to exercise the right of veto power.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.820]   My veto power is simply whether I choose to join or not.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:50.020]   And then if my commander calls me up, I have to go and do my job, regardless of my personal
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.180]   feelings about the specific circumstances.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.180]   Is that true?
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.860]   >>JAMES HENRY: The short answer is yes.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.020]   The longer answer is more complicated.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:05.820]   So in the National Guard in particular, most of our deployments that come up, they're well-known
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.460]   years in advance.
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:12.260]   And folks that really don't want to go will be able to transfer out of those units to
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.420]   other units, mostly.
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.420]   Not everyone.
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.620]   I mean, say you have 70 or 80% of a unit that's more than happy to go.
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.340]   That always means there's some that don't want to.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:27.220]   But for the most part, it is more or less voluntary in practice.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:32.820]   Not by the letter of the law, but in practice, most people in a unit that mobilize do want
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.820]   to go.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:38.100]   So how's that for a wishy-washy halfway answer?
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.020]   >>ADAM: Well, I think it's fair.
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:48.340]   And as I was considering that question after the call, I thought, why would I-- I think
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:53.460]   from observation, it would seem to me that the single most powerful thing that happens
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:18:00.120]   in the military is you develop this sense of commitment to your unit.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.940]   These are guys that you've sweat with, you've bled with, you've served with, and you cannot
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.700]   help due to the simple circumstances.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.400]   And it begins in the very beginning of training all the way through every single deployment.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:19.840]   You cannot help but form an incredibly tight bond with people, with others, with whom you
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.640]   have served in any capacity.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.480]   It happens in every context, right?
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.840]   You go on a team-building weekend with your company, you build a tighter bond.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.280]   You go on a short-term mission trip and build an orphanage somewhere, you build a tighter
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.280]   bond.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.440]   You go and you serve in hurricane relief, you build a tight bond.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.080]   You go and go to war, you build an incredibly tight bond.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:47.720]   And so you build this sense of dedication and loyalty to your unit, right?
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:54.120]   The men that are around you to whom you owe your life and you owe them a duty of care
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.120]   to them.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.520]   And so that would be an incredibly powerful thing.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:05.320]   And I think the degree of loyalty that I hear usually when I talk to people and just listen
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.200]   is often to their unit, to their commanding officers that are close to them.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:19.560]   I guess at its core, I lack any confidence in the highest levels of military leadership.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.720]   I lack absolute, I lack confidence entirely in the commander-in-chief.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:31.480]   I lack confidence entirely in the highest levels of military leadership.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.400]   I don't think that these are not people that I admire.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:40.600]   These are not people that seem to me like they're chosen for their outstanding effectiveness.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.520]   Rather they seem like they're chosen for their political savvy.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:50.360]   And so at its core, being committed to a lifestyle of liberty, it's hard to imagine why I would
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:59.240]   sign up and voluntarily surrender my liberty to men that I don't admire or respect.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:07.000]   And so I guess that, and since I'm unencumbered by the unit loyalty that is forged in the
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   fires of training and deployment, then it's relatively easy from an outside perspective
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.820]   for me to see that like, why would I sign up for that?
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.880]   But I think for a guy who's got some exposure to that, who has those relationships, that
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.720]   would be a harder thing to say.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:27.040]   >>JAMES: I see your position and for a lot of people, that's the right answer.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.720]   Not everyone should be trying to join the military and the question of who should and
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.120]   who shouldn't is a real question.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:41.920]   But in terms of that situation, political leaders are going to make good and bad decisions.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.680]   And if I could make all political leaders make decisions I like, well, then I'd be king
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.440]   and that would be bad.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:55.720]   But assuming that they will make decisions that will send my people into harm's way,
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:00.000]   would they be better off with me sitting on the sidelines or doing everything I could
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.320]   to help make sure that they come out the other side of it as well as possible?
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.960]   And that's really the, I think that's a motivating factor for most people that are in positions
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:15.680]   of leadership because you care about those junior people and you want to make sure that
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:22.600]   they get the best care that's possible in terms of leadership, whether that's in combat
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.600]   or just rough situations.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.600]   >>COREY: Right, right.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:29.480]   >>JAMES: May I comment for one moment on some of the senior military folks that you mentioned?
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.480]   >>COREY: Anything you like, anything, yes.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:37.200]   >>JAMES: So I'm currently stationed out in the DC area and I've met and interacted with
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.480]   some of those folks that you've mentioned, like some of the members of the Joint Chiefs
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.480]   of Staff.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:46.560]   And for the most part, and this is not speaking for all of them uniformly, but for the most
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:52.520]   part, they are very intelligent people and very capable people.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.440]   And for the most part, not politically motivated.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.360]   Now beyond that, when we get to the political classes, that can be a very different thing.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.840]   But in terms of the senior military leaders, most are pretty decent.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:12.120]   So levels of confidence, notwithstanding from your perspective, that's fine.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.600]   But I don't know, most of the interactions I've had with them have been more or less
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.600]   pretty positive.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.160]   >>COREY: Good, good.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.000]   Well on this particular subject, Ryan, I hope that I am more wrong than right.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.800]   And I hope that there are many, and I'm glad and I really appreciate hearing your perspective.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.960]   I'm so grateful that there are so many men and women who are serving with duty, with
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:40.080]   loyalty, with a clear moral compass, who are interceding and seeking to interpose on behalf
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.080]   of their troops.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.760]   I really, really appreciate that.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.720]   Is there anything else that you'd like to say here on a public platform as we wrap up?
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:53.440]   >>ANDREW: No, Josh, many of the things you brought up are true.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.960]   There are bad incidents that happen and there are good and bad people in the military and
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.600]   good and bad things can happen.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.000]   Everyone's individual experience will be different.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.200]   You have to, if you're going to join, you have to look at what is the right kind of
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.680]   service and component for what you're looking for and what you'd like to get out of your
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.400]   military service.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:18.040]   For me, I did the active duty army thing for a while and I found my real home in the Army
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.320]   National Guard.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:27.760]   That's the mission set and the people and the work that I...
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.400]   I think it depends a lot on each individual and what is going to be the best fit for them.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.440]   There's no good one size fits all answer.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   >>STEVE: Agreed.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   Totally agreed.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.400]   Well, Brian, thank you so much for reaching out to me.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.840]   I love that you did it and thank you for coming on and being willing to do this quick interview.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.280]   I will continue to...
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.960]   By the way, for any other listeners, I love to be challenged.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.960]   >>ANDREW: Still there?
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.960]   >>STEVE: I love to be challenged.

[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   For any other listeners...
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.960]   >>ANDREW: I hope I didn't lose you.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.040]   >>STEVE: I'm just going to mute you for a second here, Brian, while I finish up.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.480]   I love to be challenged on anything.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.840]   If you disagree with anything that I have said, I always welcome you to respond back.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:08.080]   I always welcome you to let me know what you think.

[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.360]   on today.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.920]   So, Brian, thank you so much for coming on.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.480]   Thank you for your service and I pray that God would protect you and your men and may
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.120]   you be a force for righteousness in the world and a positive force for all of us.
