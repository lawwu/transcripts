[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Technological progress seems to have been faster, the larger the connected group of people. And in
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.600]   the smallest groups, in Tasmania, you had a relatively small population, and they actually
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.280]   lost technology. They lost some fishing techniques. And if you have a small population, and you have
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.920]   some limited number of people who know a skill, they happen to die, or it happens there's like
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.480]   some change in circumstances that causes people not to practice or pass on that thing, and then
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.760]   you lose it. And if you have few people, you're doing less innovation. The rate at which you
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.040]   lose technologies to some kind of local disturbance and the rate at which you create new technologies
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.760]   can wind up in balance. And the great change of hominids and humanity is that we wound up
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.400]   in a situation where we were accumulating faster than we were losing. And as we accumulated,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.200]   those technologies allowed us to expand our population, they created additional demand
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.160]   for intelligence, that our brains became three times as large as chimpanzees.
