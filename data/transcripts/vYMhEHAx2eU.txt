[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.720]   Well, thank you all for joining us to talk once again about the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.060]   The whole translation is in, and as a result of even the Psalms, New Testament, and Proverbs
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.920]   coming out, there have been quite a few questions that have come across my desk, so I'm going
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.440]   to ask for your help right now to help me answer some of these questions.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:31.160]   One of them is about the issue of translating the word "temple" in the New Testament, and
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.200]   sometimes we have "sanctuary" as opposed to "temple" in some very familiar passages.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.680]   Dr. Varner, can you help us to think through why we did that and why is that important?
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.680]   Yes.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:49.240]   There are actually two words in Greek that render "temple" or "sanctuary," which of course
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.880]   refers in the New Testament to what we call the second temple or Herod's temple, the temple
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.600]   that was there in Jesus' day.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.960]   One is "eiron," which we have tried to consistently translate as "temple," and the other one is
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.640]   "naas," which we've tried to consistently translate as "sanctuary."
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.640]   So what's the difference?
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.600]   Why is it important?
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.980]   "Temple" is a word that describes the entire structure, including an outer courtyard, which
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.720]   probably was not in Solomon's temple.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.440]   "Sanctuary" refers to the inner section of the temple, what we call the holy place and
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.640]   the holy of holies, the priest's place, and that word "sanctuary" seems to be, at least
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.960]   in the New Testament, applying to that inner part of the temple complex.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.640]   A couple of illustrations that might help in that regard is when the Gospels say that
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.000]   Jesus cleansed the temple, he did not cleanse the sanctuary.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.760]   He cleansed the outer part of the temple, really the court of the Gentiles.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.980]   That was part of the temple complex.
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:10.120]   So that's where the sellers of animals, that's where the money changers had set up shop,
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.080]   out there in the outer part of the temple.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.200]   So he cleansed that temple from that, from those activities.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.040]   They couldn't have gotten any further into the sanctuary, but they were in the temple
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.200]   complex.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.720]   The sanctuary was where the priests did their work.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.520]   The closest that a layman would come would be to bring a sacrifice to the fence that
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.600]   separated the temple of Israel from the temple of the priests, or the sanctuary of the people
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.280]   from the sanctuary of the priests, and he would hand the animal over.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.560]   That's as far as a layman could get.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.840]   Then Judas betrayed our Lord for the pieces of silver, and then things didn't go as
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.900]   he had planned, I believe, and in the garden Jesus was arrested.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.900]   And so it says that he took that money, which had become blood money, and he cast it into
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.720]   many translations just say the temple.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.360]   But actually the Greek says he cast it into the sanctuary, which makes it even more I
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.880]   think dramatic.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.440]   He had gone through the court of the Gentiles with the money.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.280]   He had gone through the court of the women.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.080]   He had gone through Nicanor's gate and right up to the fence where a layman could go no
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.800]   further and he tossed it over the fence right into the sanctuary of the priests.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.080]   So we've tried to consistently translate and show a distinction between the outer part
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   of the temple and the inner part called the sanctuary.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.320]   And I think in later on in the epistles, the word sanctuary is used to even describe us
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.680]   as the people of God as the church.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.680]   Is that right?
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.520]   And that has particular theological meaning because the Shekinah glory, the presence of
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.720]   God was in the sanctuary, and so when we are called the "temple," we're really called the
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:21.440]   sanctuary of the Holy Spirit because in us the Holy Spirit dwells even as he dwelt in
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.600]   the Holy of Holies.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.000]   So there's this deliberate word choice and word distinction between two different terms
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.520]   that describe the "temple," but really the temple complex versus the very structure of
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.720]   the temple itself, the sanctuary, and by bringing that out, there is a theological significance
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.720]   to it.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.720]   - It certainly is.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.720]   - Yeah.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.720]   - Certainly.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.360]   - But while I have you here, let me ask another question, and people have asked me this.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.640]   Why did you guys change brethren to brothers?
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:02.600]   - This was a mini crusade of mine, but you guys got on board with it very, very early.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.480]   There are certain words that I call "church words" that we only use them in church.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.960]   We don't use them in everyday talk.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.720]   We don't even use them outside church when we're talking with each other, and one of
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.280]   those is "brethren."
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.920]   Now you tell me, do you ever refer to your male siblings as your brethren?
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.400]   No, you don't.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.080]   But in church, sometimes we refer to our spiritual brothers as "brethren," but the Greek word
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.400]   is the same for physical brothers and also for spiritual brothers.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:45.720]   And if the Greek word is the same, when Paul addresses the brothers in Philippi, the brothers
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.640]   in Thessalonica, he's talking about the spiritual brothers, and there's no difference in the
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.920]   Greek word, so why don't we keep it as "brothers."
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.680]   So I think that's important.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:05.680]   I don't think we lose any theological or gain anything theologically from it, but we I think
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.200]   correct what I call a "church word."
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.440]   Now there's something else, Abner, and that is some of modern translations, when they
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:24.680]   come to brothers, because they don't want to eliminate the ladies, they will automatically,
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.520]   even though the Greek just says "brothers," say "brothers and sisters."
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:36.240]   We have refused to do that because we know that "brothers" can be collective.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:43.280]   It's not just referring to male believers in those times when brothers are addressed
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.460]   in a church.
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.600]   It is "brothers and sisters," but it's just one word.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:57.240]   But in James chapter 2, when James wants to specifically address brothers and sisters,
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.600]   he says that.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:06.140]   If you see a brother or a sister in need, but he adds the Greek word "sister."
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:15.640]   So when the New Testament writers wanted to include sisters, they included the word "sister."
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:23.200]   So I think it's not only getting away from just a churchy word, brethren, but it's also
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.560]   honoring that's what it says.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:32.640]   And also, can we leave something to the preacher and teacher, who should come to the word "brothers"
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:41.200]   and remind the congregation that these spiritual brothers include male and female believers
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.280]   in the Lord Jesus.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:49.760]   So let's leave some choice to the preacher or teacher to bring that out.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.560]   So I think, well, I think we did the right thing in keeping it to "brothers."
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:01.560]   Yeah, that's what the text says, and that actually by keeping it not only with the translation
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:07.280]   of "brothers," but not including "and sisters" as a gloss on top of that brings out when
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.040]   the New Testament actually does say it.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.120]   It makes it stand out all the more.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.800]   There's a deliberateness to that that is lost if you always just translate the gloss with
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.480]   multiple words.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.340]   So this is, I think this is a very important observation.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.760]   One of the other questions that have popped across my desk is the New Testament's use
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:29.640]   of the old and how we signify that in the legacy standard, following the NASB with some
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.200]   small caps.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.780]   But people have been wondering, "Where have you done more?
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.880]   Where have you brought that out more?"
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.600]   So Jason, why don't you begin by helping us identify some of those, and then Paul, you
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   can follow up.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   Yeah, sure.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   I would love to.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:49.280]   One that sticks out, I think, for me is Luke chapter 12, verse 35.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.720]   This one actually hits a couple different points that we wanted to draw out, in particular
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.000]   the Old Testament and the New, but several others even just having a window into the
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.560]   text that we've been kind of encouraging to do that.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.600]   "Gird up your loins" seems like an old expression.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.360]   Most people don't talk about girding up your loins, and in fact, some of the translations
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.160]   just simply render it ready for service, ready for action.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.200]   But we translated it "gird up your loins" in particular because it was a quotation from
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.280]   Exodus 12, verse 11.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:31.840]   And both contexts have this idea of being prepared and ready to act when God will deliver
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.880]   His people.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:41.000]   So in Luke 12, 35 through 40, Christ is talking about His return, and when the Son of Man
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.080]   comes at an hour that you don't expect, and He uses terms like "waiting" and "ready" and
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.080]   "awake."
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:55.480]   And so we translated that, what other translations would simply try to help the reader understand
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.840]   a little bit more by a modern translation.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:04.040]   We wanted to go back because there's not only a connection back to the Old Testament in
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:11.920]   which the Israelites were being told to be ready and prepared and waiting for the deliverance
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:19.280]   that Yahweh would bring, Christ points back to that in the same context of His second
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.720]   coming and His disciples being ready for that deliverance.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.200]   And then there's also a wordplay on that that you lose if you don't translate that.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.800]   Not only do you lose that Old Testament quotation, which we rendered in small caps, but you have
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.920]   this idea of where Christ is saying, "Gird up your loins and keep your lamps lit."
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:46.120]   And waiting for the Master to return, and when He comes you open up the door and then
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.440]   it says in verse 37, "Blessed are those slaves whom the Master will find awake when He comes
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:57.040]   truly I say to you that He will gird Himself to serve and to have them recline at the table."
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.480]   And so the expectation is the servants are ready and they're girded, meaning their robes
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.420]   are wrapped up and ready for service, ready for work.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:11.680]   And when the Master comes, you would anticipate that it would be the servants who are serving,
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.720]   and yet it's the Master when He returns, the one who will serve.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.200]   And this eschatological banquet of this dinner table.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.520]   So there's just a lot of, I think, nuances there that by simply having a window into
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:32.160]   the text of girding up your loins, connecting it back into Exodus, there's a lot of, I think,
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:39.040]   depth that the average reader might miss that I think we're trying to help give some insight
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.040]   into.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:47.240]   Yeah, if you honor the text, the text is so sophisticated, the text is so rich.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.000]   All these implications, not just like you just pointed out of connecting back with the
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.480]   Old Testament, but connecting within the passage itself, there's so much theology that comes
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   out.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.640]   That's really, really good.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.200]   Help us out, Paul.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:07.640]   Another one that comes to mind, sticking with Luke, the author, now in the book of Acts,
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:13.960]   in chapter 1, verse 8, Jesus gives the disciples their blueprint, their mission.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:19.400]   And He says that you're to preach the gospel, you're to be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.200]   and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.280]   And we've capitalized that last phrase, "to the end of the earth," believing it to be
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:31.720]   an intentional quotation of the Old Testament scriptures.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.880]   Now the NASB doesn't do that.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.720]   Why did we think that was appropriate?
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.560]   As you read through the book of Acts, what you start to see is a theology where Luke
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:47.000]   is intentionally portraying the apostles' ministry in the likeness of the servant.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.560]   So he's not only drawing arcs back to his gospel, he's doing that, and showing these
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.600]   apostles are simply carrying on the ministry of the Lord Jesus.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.280]   A lot of things that happens to them happen to Christ, a lot of things they do are similar
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.840]   to what Christ did.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.760]   He's drawing those arcs, but in addition, he's drawing arcs all the way back to Isaiah.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:16.000]   And he's trying to stress, I think, that this mission, this gospel mission, is one that
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.560]   is advanced through suffering, the suffering that we see in Isaiah.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.520]   And so that term, "the end of the earth," it's found in a number of places in the Old
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.720]   Testament, but it is found in one of the servant songs.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.760]   And so as Jesus gives the blueprint to the apostles, "This is what you're going to do,"
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.920]   he's not simply giving them geographical locations.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.820]   We tend to think of Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria, and the end of the earth as just a geographical
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.220]   progression of the gospel.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.860]   It is that, but it's so much more.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.320]   These are not just markers on a map.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:52.680]   I mean, think about the fact Jerusalem's a city, Judea and Samaria's a region with certain
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.080]   connotations because of the Samaritans and their relationship with the Jews.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.920]   And then you get the end of the earth, not simply the extremity, but to the Gentiles.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.240]   The gospel's going to the Gentiles.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.520]   And as we know from the book of Isaiah, that was the servant's ministry.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.880]   The glory of the Lord is too great to be contained within Israel.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:18.440]   It's to go out to the Gentiles, and we understand from Isaiah 53 that the means by which that
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.480]   will happen will be through suffering.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.480]   And so it is a hint, and it gets developed as you read through the book of Acts.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.680]   That theology gets developed, but we believe that in that first chapter there's just the
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:37.520]   first subtle hint that this book, the book of Acts, is going to be one that portrays
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:43.520]   the apostles in the likeness of the servant, particularly with reference to his suffering.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:49.560]   And so it's in capitals as an indication that it's drawing from Old Testament theology there.
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:54.760]   And that's so rich because that indication draws from the Old Testament the way you just
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:01.840]   said, and it draws a very deep and rich and broad theology into and incorporate into the
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.840]   book of Acts.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.840]   That's very helpful.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:10.100]   Paul, while I have you, you have talked about and we've talked about some other translational
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.320]   decisions that kind of bring out some nuance in 1 John.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.600]   Would you share some of those with us?
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:24.020]   So if we jump over then to 1 John, and I think what we're talking about here is a more literal
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:30.460]   rendering of something that John says, which I remember we kind of deliberated over this
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.880]   for some time because it's difficult to bring out in the English, and the tendency would
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.680]   be to find a synonym, but when you do that you lose what John is doing.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:49.120]   So I'm in 1 John chapter 5 here, and John says, verse 1, "Everyone who believes that
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.800]   Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the one who gives new
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.680]   birth loves also the one who has been born of him."
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:04.400]   And it sounds maybe a little bit convoluted, and I think if you check other translations
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.080]   that second half of the verse will make reference to the Father and to those who have been born
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:14.360]   of him, which is a good translation, and it captures the essence.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:22.640]   The problem is you miss the play that John makes on the verb to beget, to give birth.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.640]   So the verse would read, perhaps even more literally, "Everyone who loves the one who
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:35.120]   begets, the begetting one, God the Father, also loves the one who has been begotten,
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.600]   who has received the new birth."
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:46.980]   And I think what our translation does, it draws out that subtle play that John is making
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:54.480]   on this concept of the new birth, which again plays into the theology of this letter.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.640]   When we understand who we are, we're those that have been privileged, we've received
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.560]   the new birth, and when I understand that about myself and about you, you're one that's
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.080]   received the new birth and so am I, how can I not love you?
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:16.440]   How can I not love you as an expression of my love for the one who gave me the new birth?
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:23.440]   We're caught up in this theology of the new birth, and John brings that out by refusing
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:30.460]   to simply say "Father" and "Children of God," but just to keep using that one verb, "genao,"
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.700]   to give birth in this one verse, and so we tried to do that.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:40.520]   And then just a few verses later, another one that we really tried hard to bring out
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.240]   what John's doing, in verse four, he says, "For everything that has been born of God
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:51.320]   overcomes the world, and this is the overcoming that has overcome the world, our faith."
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:59.520]   Again, it sounds convoluted, and perhaps the more straightforward path is to find synonyms.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:06.600]   But John is intentionally using this one verb, "genao," to overcome, to conquer, and he's
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.120]   doing it in a very emphatic way.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.080]   This is the triumph that triumphs.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.600]   This is the victory that victors.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.200]   That's what John is saying.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:29.400]   And when you see that intentional persistence with this one verb, "to conquer," you understand
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.420]   just how emphatic John is being.
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:38.800]   When you've received the new birth, you are no longer enslaved to sin, period.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.140]   Sin is not going to triumph in your life, ultimately.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.360]   And he wants to communicate that as a great encouragement to his readers, and we tried
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:52.840]   to bring that out by also persisting with one English verb here, "to overcome."
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:58.560]   That's really helpful, and I think when we bring out what is already there, I think that's
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.660]   the predominant theme.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.000]   We are…there is a reason for it, not just on a translation philosophy side, but really
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:12.200]   on a bibliology side, because we believe that the Bible is inspired and that we don't improve
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   on it.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.100]   We just deliver what it is, and it in and of itself has it, and there is significance
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.640]   in every word choice, every decision that the Scriptures make.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:28.320]   Along that line, people sometimes wonder about James 3.1, and they say, "Oh, you kind of
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.120]   changed it from what NASB had.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:36.160]   Let not many of you brothers or brethren or whatnot become teachers," but we translate
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:42.160]   it with a more direct imperative, "Do not become teachers, many of you."
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.880]   And why was that?
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:49.000]   Well, "Let someone not become this" is a more indirect imperative.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.500]   It would be more of a third-person kind of imperative, but James is not trying to skirt
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.500]   away from the issue.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:04.040]   He is making a demand directly to his readers that many of them, many of you, you may never
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.120]   become this way.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.840]   You do not become this way, and we didn't want to lose that force because that's James's
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.200]   decision, and we wanted to honor that.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:18.220]   And so these are the kinds of decisions where I almost describe it like Simon says.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.080]   The author says it this way, so we do it that way, but we don't really have an option,
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.880]   and that's a really great thing.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:31.160]   Dr. Varner, help us think through another one of these kind of consistency word issues,
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.160]   which is of one accord.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.160]   One accord.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.160]   Help us to think through that.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.560]   Well, you know, I like to use silly puns to keep my students' attention, and here's one
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.240]   of those.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:47.360]   The King James, and we do too, say that all the believers were in one accord, and the
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.420]   silly thing is there are Hondas in the Bible, a Honda accord.
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.720]   And well, apart from the silliness, accord is a good word.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.320]   It means together, one accord, one mind, one purpose.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.360]   We've tried to consistently translate that word, hamathumadon, and one accord.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:12.740]   Actually, we do it more often with one accord, same meaning.
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.720]   It appears 10 times in the book of Acts, six times a positive statement.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.120]   All the believers were together with one accord.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:28.440]   Four times in a negative way, the enemies of Stephen rose up against him with one accord.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:34.440]   So 10 times it appears in the book of Acts, and we've tried to consistently translate
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:41.580]   it with one accord, while other versions will mix with one mind, with one purpose.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:47.620]   But Luke used the same word, and I think we should translate it that way.
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:54.800]   It does appear one time out of the book of Acts, Paul uses it, that with one accord,
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:02.740]   Jews and Gentiles might glorify God, Romans 15, 6.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:10.300]   So I think in translating it with one accord, we've done honor to Luke and to Paul, and
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:16.720]   brought out that it can be with one bad accord or evil accord, and it can be with one good
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.480]   accord, depending on the context.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.100]   - And the reader will know that's the same word.
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.360]   That's the same word all the way through.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.120]   They can trace it out themselves.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.800]   That's really useful.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.120]   Are there any materials, this is another question people have, are there any materials, new
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:42.360]   kinds of research that really helped you all, us all in the process of translating and updating
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.060]   the New American Standard to the Legacy Standard Bible, were there specific resources that
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:51.040]   you used in this process that really helped?
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.120]   - I mentioned this on an earlier video.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.000]   This might be a little bit of a repetition, but in Textual Criticism, we are the first
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.700]   English translation to have access to not just one Greek New Testament, but three editions
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:11.060]   of the Greek New Testament, the Nestle-Alan, the SBL Greek New Testament, and the Tyndale
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:20.560]   House Greek New Testament, that was done in a city called Cambridge, so we have access
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.560]   to that.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:27.880]   Now, Textual Criticism can be boring to a lot of people, I understand that, but we are
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:35.080]   not just depending on one group, say, of German Text Critics, we have an American Text Critic
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:42.220]   and British Text Critics to compare and see, and I think while we have stayed with the
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:47.400]   Nestle-Alan reading most of the time, we've been able to benefit from the scholarship
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.400]   of others.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:55.840]   I just heard an American Text Critic say yesterday in Mark 1-1, the beginning of the Gospel of
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:02.920]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, there are some manuscripts that don't have Son of God.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:10.040]   We retain that, and not only do manuscripts support it, but internally that's supported
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:15.740]   because Son of God is a major theme in the Gospel of Mark.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:21.960]   At the beginning, and then towards the end, the Centurion says, "Certainly this was
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.280]   God's Son.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.580]   This was the Son of God."
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.080]   So at the beginning and the end of the Gospel of Mark.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:35.560]   So not only do the manuscripts support the inclusion of these words, but internally,
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.360]   what's called internal evidence, supports the inclusion of those words as well.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:46.560]   Yeah, I'm thinking from a Hebrew side, we had access to at least part of things of like
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:52.720]   BHQ, Biblia Hebraica Quinta, and did you guys, and this is just me asking off the cuff, did
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.320]   you guys use Bible software in the process?
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:02.040]   We, I mean, our meetings were on Logos, and then I would always have my accordance as
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.040]   well.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:10.240]   And yeah, I just always ponder what it would have been like to undertake such a project
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.320]   before the age of Bible software.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.440]   I mean, you just can't imagine.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:20.240]   And so I was very, very thankful for the resources that we had, but also just the quick and ready
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.240]   access we had.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.520]   - And I think we're also drawing on just a wealth of research that we've done in the
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.720]   past.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:33.040]   I'm thinking of issues in Romans, and Luke, I had read some articles by Gathercol, and
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:39.080]   we incorporated that research in our commentary on John by Carson and certain lexical issues
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.600]   that he raised there, and we tried to wrestle through and how to process that.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:50.220]   And I know both of you are in the process of dissertation work, and so you guys brought
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.080]   a lot of those insights into the mix as well.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.960]   So yeah, there, I think there was a lot, a lot of just a wealth of research that comes
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:03.440]   in a lifetime study that comes into Bible translation, and that's important to note.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.440]   And we're thankful.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.320]   We're just thankful for a lot of people who have done a lot of hard work and invested
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.320]   in us in that way.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:13.360]   - And the quick access that we have to all of that at the fingertips, that is, you know,
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:18.200]   you could potentially have to stop and go and go to libraries and things like that,
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:24.160]   but with us and the ability, the benefit of having COVID shut down where we were really
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:30.820]   isolated in our homes, the software was really helpful, Logos, and I still am an old user
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:31.820]   of BibleWorks.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.680]   It's still working for me, as well as Accordance and those things.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.280]   So it was, I think, really valuable.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:43.520]   - Yeah, I had BibleWorks and Accordance on my screen, and every verse I was comparing.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.240]   I could see the Greek, I could see three or four or five translations that we could compare
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.240]   it with.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:55.480]   It was very, very helpful, and I'm glad to see that Accordance, and I use Accordance
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:01.960]   every day now with the LSB being part of the Accordance modules.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:07.120]   - And I think this just kind of brings us full circle back to the whole idea of why
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.080]   we do what we do and how we do it.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.480]   It's not just arbitrary decisions.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.000]   This is well-researched.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.080]   It's based upon the author's decision, and that kind of even ties into a question that
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:23.960]   people have, which is, "Why did you translate Messiah in some places, even in the New Testament
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:29.760]   at times, but Christ predominantly in the New Testament, and yet in the Old Testament,
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.600]   anointed one or Messiah is present?"
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:38.520]   And it goes back to the same principle, which is, we say what the text says.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:44.120]   John sometimes has the word Messiah transliterated, and when he does that, we say it.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.000]   And when Christ is used, the Greek word there, we reflect that.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.520]   And that's kind of the overriding principle there.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.520]   There are decisions.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.920]   We're not making arbitrary choices.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:59.040]   We're trying to do as much research as we can into them so that what comes forth is
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:07.440]   not our opinion, but rather a window into what exactly was going on, represented correctly
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.480]   from the Greek and Hebrew and Aramaic of the Scriptures.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.840]   And that's kind of our goal.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.920]   Thank you guys for your great work on this, and thank you for answering these questions.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.000]   I hope it's been very edifying for everyone.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Thank you.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Thank you.
