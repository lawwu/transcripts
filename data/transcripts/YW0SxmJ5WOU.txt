[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   We did take one trek one night to a restaurant called Monkey Pod, which is operated by Merriman's.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.640]   Also a big restaurant conglomerate in Hawaii.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.380]   It was awesome.
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.440]   Live music, really fun, great cocktails.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.880]   Would highly recommend it.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.180]   That said, it's in the middle of a shopping center.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.220]   And shopping center vibes is not exactly what I was going for with a relaxing Hawaiian vacation.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.560]   It felt a little chaotic, but the food was great.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.920]   But it was really easy to get to because one of the perks that I think is a little underrated at the montage
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.560]   and why I think anyone listening should always dig into the details of all the perks at your hotel
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.820]   because I brought this perk up to multiple people we met in the pool and no one had heard of it.
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.960]   But they have a Cadillac XT6, which is an SUV that seats six or seven people.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.580]   And you can just borrow it anytime you want for free for four hours.
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.660]   You couldn't book it.
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.340]   They told us no one's ever using it.
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.520]   So we picked it up, went and got groceries.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.280]   We picked it up, we drove to dinner, had a nice dinner and came home.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.120]   So really underrated perk that you would have found on the website.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.540]   You would have found if you asked the front desk, but you definitely wouldn't have found
[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.300]   if you had just hoped that they gave you a brochure when you checked in.
