[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, are there morally neutral areas of life?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   That's the first question on the table as we begin this new week together.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Welcome back to the podcast, and thank you for making us part of your weekly routine.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   We appreciate it. The question is from Mary Beth,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   who lives in Arkansas. She writes us this. "Hello, Pastor John,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   and thank you for the Ask Pastor John podcast. A question has been troubling me for a
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   while." It's this one. "I'm wondering if everything in life
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   is either a good thing or a sin, or are there
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   some okay things that are not sin but are not exactly
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   good either? Sometimes I do things that don't seem beneficial.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I can't tell if I need forgiveness for them. I usually
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   ask for forgiveness anyways. I guess basically my question boils down to that.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Pastor John, yes or no, are there morally neutral
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   areas of life?" I can't give a yes
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   or a no answer until I
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   clarify some terms. So, what is sin?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   What is the moral good?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   What does morally neutral
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   mean? This is one of those
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   great illustrations, Tony, of how simply
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   defining our terms virtually answers the question.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   It's a great lesson to learn. I recommend
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   it to everybody. I find that most arguments
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   people are having go round and round
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   because the terms are undefined with any
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   biblical precision. And the reason I say biblical
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   precision is because if you don't have an authority
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   that you can both agree on, then you
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   probably won't even be able to define your terms
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   in a way that you both can agree on and you'll just be stuck.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And our culture right now is
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   stuck because we don't share much
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   common ground under our disputes. And a
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   stuck culture is a dangerous thing because
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   if there's no agreed on arbiter of
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   truth claims, then what comes in to fill that void
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   is usually raw power. If some common
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   ground doesn't decide what's right,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   then might makes right. Or more to the point
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   here, if a shared authority does not decide the definition of our terms,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   like the Bible, then the one with
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   the most power will decide how words are going to be used.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And that's how the Holocaust happened. That's how race-based
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   slavery happened. That's how abortion happens. The powerful
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   decide how the word "person" is going to be used
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and who fits in with it and who doesn't. And without an
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   agreed on authority to arbitrate, then the powerful
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   define the terms and suit their preference. Well,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   that's way more than Mary Beth asked for. In fact, she didn't ask for that
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   at all. But now and then, I
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   like to explain on this podcast why I make
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   such a big deal out of defining our terms. So there you heard it.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So here's my effort to clarify the terms
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   of Mary Beth's question. "Is everything
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   in life," she says, "a good thing or sin?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Are there morally neutral areas?" That's her question. So here's
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   what is sin? There are at least two passages in Paul that
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I think get at the heart of what sin is. One is chapters 1-3
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   of Romans. Romans 3.23 says that we've all sinned
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   and then it adds this. We fall short of, or literally
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   we lack, the glory of God. And I connect that
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   statement with Romans 1.23 where humans exchange
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   the glory of God
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   for the glory of created things, including the human self, my
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   glory. That's my favorite idol, right? So I think
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   what Romans 3.23 means is that all
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   human beings sin in that we prefer
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   created glory over God's
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   glory. We exchange God's glory
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   for something we prefer, so we lack
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   or fall short of the glory
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   of God. So sin is first, this is my definition
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   now drawn from Romans, sin is first
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   the disposition of the human heart to prefer human
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   glory, especially self-glory, over God's glory.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And then secondarily, sins, plural,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   would be the attitudes and words and actions that stem
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   from that disposition. That's my definition of
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   sin from Romans 3 and 1.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   The other passage that defines the heart of sin is Romans 14.23
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   where Paul is talking about eating meat
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   and drinking wine, verse 21
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   in chapter 14, and then he says this in verse 23,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   "Whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   the eating is not from faith,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   for whatever does not proceed from
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   faith is sin." Wow.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   That's pretty sweeping. So Paul is willing to
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   define sin as whatever is not from faith,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   which I think, when you analyze it carefully down to the bottom,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   is really the same as the definition
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   in Romans 1 and 3.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   If the disposition of our heart is not to
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   receive Christ—I'm thinking what faith is right now—
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   is not to receive Christ, to own Christ
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   as our supreme Savior and guide and treasure,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   then what comes from that heart is sin.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   That heart is the same as the heart that prefers
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   created glory over God's glory. Now, with that
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   definition of sin, the
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   definition of what is morally good
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   follows as the flip side of sin or
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   evil. Moral good is the disposition of the heart to
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   prefer God over all or to treasure God
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   in Christ over all, so that the attitudes and
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   words and actions that stem from that heart are good.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Morally good. Now, there are
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   two other ways to describe this moral good, because
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   they result from acting in faith or a preference
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   for the superior worth of God in Christ. One is
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   to say that the moral good are those
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   attitudes and words and actions which God has commanded—
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   1 John 5:2—and the other is
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   to say that the moral good is attitudes and
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   words and actions that aim to glorify God—1 Corinthians
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   10:31. So, we're actually on safest ground,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I think, to say that what is morally good
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   has all three of these traits. One, it comes from
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   faith; two, it accords with God's commands; three, it
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   aims to glorify God. That's morally good. That's the morally
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   good. So, here's the implication about whether there are
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   neutral areas of life, because that's what she's asking
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   about. If we mean, are there actions
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   considered without any reference to humans doing
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   those actions, just actions in the abstract, the
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   answer is yes. Yes. There are thousands of such
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   morally neutral—in that sense, morally neutral—actions, like
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   walking down the street, drinking a glass of water, putting
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   on your shoes. It's not so much that they
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   are morally neutral, though—I'm a little skittish about that phrase—it's
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   not so much that they're morally neutral, but that they have no moral
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   standing at all until a human
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   being is doing them. As soon as someone
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   does them, no matter how simple,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   no matter how supposedly neutral,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   they cease to be neutral. They become moral
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   because, Paul said, "Whatever you do,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   do all—put on your shoes, walk down the street, do all
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   to the glory of God." And either we do that or we
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   don't. And that criterion makes them either sin or not sin.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And in the same way, we could ask, "Did we do them from faith? Whatever's not
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   from faith is sin. Did I put on my shoes from a disposition
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   of faith? If not," Paul says, "it's sin." You can put
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   on your shoes rebelliously. You really can. So I think what
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   this means for Mary Beth's concern is this.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   If an action or attitude
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   is not forbidden or commanded
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   in the Bible, then the question for her
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   and for all of us is, "Am I moved
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   to do this action by faith
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   and by a desire to glorify God?"
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   If so, then she invests
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   that seemingly neutral act with moral
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   goodness. You do something from faith that's not forbidden
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   in the Scriptures, it has moral goodness, no matter what it is.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And if not, then no matter how
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   neutral the act may seem, she makes it a sin
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   because it's not done in reliance upon Christ
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   or for his glory.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Yeah, thank you, Pastor John. Romans 3.23 is fascinating, that
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   sin is first the disposition of the human heart to prefer
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   human glory, especially self-glory, over
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   God's glory. That's a profound definition of sin
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   as replaced or misplaced glory.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And speaking of Romans 3.23 and the following verse,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   verse 24, next time we're going to look at them more closely as we consider, "How can
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I become an unshakable person in this world?"
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   That's what we want. We want to become unshakable people.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And that's what this text holds the key to. Until then, thanks for joining us today.
