[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700]   In the following sermon, which was preached in Westminster Chapel on Sunday morning, the 11th of July 1965,
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:16.620]   Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones is preaching from the Gospel according to John, chapter 1, verses 49 to 51.
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.400]   We now join him as he makes his introductory remarks.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.760]   Here's Dr. Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.000]   With the fundamental affirmation, "In the beginning was the Word,"
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.560]   "and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,"
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.500]   "leading unto, and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us."
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.360]   And then showing us the ultimate purpose of all that,
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.000]   which is, "that unto as many as received him,"
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.760]   "gave he authority to become the sons of God."
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.000]   "Even unto them that believe on his name,"
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.360]   "which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of men, but of God."
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.000]   And then this tremendous statement in the 16th verse,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   "Of his fullness, of all we received, and grace upon grace."
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Now, we've spent two years in looking into all that in this section which follows,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   in which we get the testimony of John the Baptist to all that.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.500]   This is Christianity.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.500]   What is a Christian?
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:37.500]   Well, a Christian is a man who can say, "Of his fullness have I received, and grace upon grace."
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.800]   Christianity is not morality, not merely religion, not merely church membership.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.000]   A Christian is a man who's in a vital, living relationship to the Son of God,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   and he has received something of his fullness.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Now, John the Baptist, I say, bore testimony to that.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   People thought that he, John, was the long-expected Messiah.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   John dismisses the suggestion.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   "I indeed," he says, "baptize with water."
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   "He shall baptize with the Holy Ghost, and with power."
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And that's the thing we've been considering for many months, since the beginning of last October.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   This is, again, essential Christianity.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ baptizes with the Holy Ghost,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and we've been considering something of the content of that great statement.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   But, as I've been pointing out,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   the danger is that when we look at such great and high and exalted doctrine
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   that many people feel a sense of discouragement.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   They say, "Well, of course, that may be all right for some great and notable saints."
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   "That may be all right for people who forsake the world and become monks or hermits or anchorites,"
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   "and just give the whole of their life and attention and energy"
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   "to the cultivation of their spiritual life."
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   "But how can I, in the midst of life and its affairs, business and profession,"
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   "how can I ever hope to attain to such a height?"
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Well, now, it's my suggestion that from verse 35 to the end of the chapter,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   John, as it were, anticipating some such feeling,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   has provided us these pictures of these various men
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   who became apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   He shows us these men in their earliest beginnings,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   and how from death they were led on by the Lord himself to the great heights,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   which they eventually reached.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And I say that this is something which is most encouraging and comforting and exhilarating.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   You see, it doesn't depend upon us; it depends upon the power of the Lord.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And here we see him exercising it, taking these men as they were,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   with their humble origins, some of them even coming from a place called Bethsaida,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   a terrible place, a place which rarely rejected the Lord himself, doesn't matter.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   One's antecedents don't matter in the Christian life.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   It is his power that matters.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Well, now, then, we've been doing that, and we've come at last to this last of the illustrations,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   namely this man, Nathaniel.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   We began studying him and the story about him last Sunday morning.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I would remind you of the things which stood out there most clearly.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   We saw that our Lord always praises honesty, sincerity, and integrity.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   When our Lord saw Nathaniel coming to him, he said of him,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile."
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   My dear friends, without sincerity, without honesty, you get nowhere in this life.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   You can get a good way in the world without sincerity.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   You can travel far without being found out.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Even in the world, you'll probably be found out eventually.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   But it's no use bringing that into this realm.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   You can't even start here.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   The Lord knows everything.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   He reads us like an open book.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And so, when he sees a man like this coming, who is honest and who is sincere,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   he commends him, and he praises him.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   But the thing that we saw standing out above everything else was this,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   that Nathaniel gives us a great object lesson as to how we should test and evaluate
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   reports that are brought to us of spiritual experiences.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   You remember how Philip went running to him and said,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   "Come and come," he says, "we have found him of whom Moses is in the law,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   But you remember how Nathaniel picked on this place, Nazareth.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   He says, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?"
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And we showed how the question was based upon his knowledge of the Scriptures.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And then we ended by showing the encouragement that our Lord gave him.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Nathaniel had his troubles, his perplexities, his doubts, his questions,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   but he's such an honest man that when Philip says to him,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   "Well, I can't answer you, come and see," he went.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And the result of his going was that great encouragement that was given to him
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   by our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   But now that isn't the whole of the lesson that we can learn from the case of Nathaniel.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And I take you to this further lesson this morning.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   What else is there here? Well, let me put it like this.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   First of all, in passing, before I come to the main thing, let me just say a word like this.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   This case, surely, and indeed the other cases also,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   show us the importance of religious instruction,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   particularly a knowledge of the Scriptures.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   You notice that these men all speak in terms of the Scriptures.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   "We have found him of whom Moses and the law and the prophets did write."
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Now that conveyed something to Nathaniel.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   It had already meant a great deal to Philip.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It had meant a great deal to all of them.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   You remember how Andrew said the same to Simon,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   "We have found the Messiah, which is being interpreted, the Christ."
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It strikes you at once as you look at the stories of these men
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   that it was a great help and advantage to them
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   that they had their Old Testament background.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   They knew their Scriptures. They'd been taught in them.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   They were well-versed in them.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And like all these instructed Jews, they were looking forward to the coming of a great deliverer,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   a great Messiah, so that when Christ appeared,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   they've got a context, they've got a background.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And they're able to approach the truth in a better way than if they hadn't got this background.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Now, I'm simply putting it like this.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Thank God that isn't essential.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   It isn't essential.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Thank God it's possible for a man to come into a place like this off the street
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   who's never read a Bible in his life and has never had a second's instruction in these holy matters.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Thank God it's possible for such a man here and now to be gripped by the truth
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   and to be changed by the power of the Spirit.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   It's possible. It's happened thousands of times.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Fools who came to scoff remain to pray.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   But while I say that this scriptural knowledge is not essential,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   it is extremely valuable.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And if you parents have no other reason for teaching your children the Bible,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   here is a very good reason.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   It isn't so much what may happen to them now as the value of all this to them later.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   The background, the understanding, the knowledge.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And one of the saddest things surely in the life of this our country today is how this is being forgotten.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   The family altar is gone and children are not instructed in even the knowledge of the Scriptures.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I'm not saying that you should press them to conversion.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   I don't believe in that. I don't advocate that.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   All I'm saying is, acquaint them with the facts.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Give them the knowledge, the history and the teaching.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   So that later, when they come face to face in some manner or another with the Blessed Lord himself,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   they'll have a background, they'll have an understanding,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   they'll have something which will help them in their approach.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   There is therefore here a word of great encouragement to all,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   not only parents but Sunday school teachers and others.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Go on with your work, my friends.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   You never know what it's going to lead to.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Children may be indifferent now, they may pay no attention,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   but the knowledge is soaking in.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   And eventually, when the crisis comes, this will all be illuminated for them.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And they'll thank God, not only for the knowledge,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   but they'll thank God for you who gave them the knowledge
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   and helped them to come to this glorious understanding.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   However, I say that in passing in order that we may come to what I regard as the greatest lesson of all,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   taught us in the case, this case of Nathanael.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I'll put it as a principle.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   It is the importance of accepting and acknowledging what we do see.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   That's the thing that's taught us here.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   You remember the story.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Nathanael comes at the request of Philip, and our Lord sees him coming,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   and he makes this remark concerning him.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile."
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And immediately Nathanael is arrested by this.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Nathanael saith unto him, "Whence knowest thou me?"
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   How do you know me?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   We saw last Sunday that that means this,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   that Nathanael was saying in effect, "Has Philip told you about me?"
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And our Lord says, "No, that isn't how I know thee.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   I know thee before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   I saw thee."
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And the moment our Lord says that, Nathanael answered and saith unto him,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Thou art the King of Israel."
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Now what does this mean?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Well, it means this.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Our Lord revealed to Nathanael that he had watched him there under the fig tree.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Remember how the branches come down almost to the earth,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   and the leaves conceal them in?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   It was a secret place into which people retired for thought and meditation and prayer.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   But our Lord had seen him there,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   and not only that, he knew what was passing in his mind and in his heart
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   while he was there under the fig tree.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And our Lord says this to Nathanael,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   and Nathanael immediately makes this great confession.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   This is enough to assure him of certain things.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   What are they?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Well, he addresses him now as "Rabbi."
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   He didn't do so before.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   You see, Nathanael was troubled over this question of Nazareth.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   That seemed to him to be quite wrong.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   But he comes at the request of his friend Philip,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   and when he heard this, his whole attitude changes.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   He says, "Rabbi," which means teacher, master,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   one who is competent to teach, one who has knowledge, one who has understanding.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   You see, he acknowledges that at once.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   But he doesn't stop at that.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   He says, "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God."
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Now, he arrives at that conclusion, of course,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   because it is clear to him that this knowledge and insight
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   of this person, Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   is none other than that of a God.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   It's supernatural.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   This is knowledge that one doesn't obtain by the usual channels.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   This is something beyond nature.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   This is divine knowledge, he says.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   This is an insight such as only God has into the heart
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   and the mind and the spiritual condition of a man's soul.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Therefore, he sees that he is the Son of God.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   He can't explain him in any other terms.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And the moment he sees that, he acknowledges it, he confesses it.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God."
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   But he can't stop at that.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   You see, there's a certain logic in these matters.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   One step leads to another.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   He says, "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Thou art the King of Israel."
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And that means this, "Thou art the Messiah."
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   He says, "You are the one that we've been expecting, obviously.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   If you are the Son of God, well, then you've got a mission
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   and a purpose in this world.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   You've come here to do something.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   You are the fulfillment of the prophets.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   You are the teacher and the leader and the deliverer
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   of the people of Israel.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   You are the King of Israel,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   God's appointed instrument and servant
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   in leading us from bondage into captivity."
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Now, I don't stay this morning with those great definitions.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   We've already come across them.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   The prologue has dealt with these things.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   John the Baptist has kept on saying the same thing,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   "Behold, the Lamb of God hath taken away the sin of the world."
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   And then he says, "I saw and bear record that this is the Son of God."
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   We've already dealt with that.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   What I'm concerned about this morning is this important principle,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   that Nathanael, the moment he sees this much,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   acknowledges it and confesses it,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   and that is one of the most important things that we can ever learn.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   There are steps and stages in this Christian life.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Nathanael doesn't understand everything perfectly at this point.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   He, like the other disciples, failed many times afterwards.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   But this is the thing that's so clear.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Here, in a flash, as it were,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   he sees this amount of truth.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   This is the Teacher.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   This is the Son of God.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   This is the King of Israel.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   And he, therefore, accepts that.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   He confesses it.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   He states it.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   He acknowledges it with the whole of his being.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And I'm emphasizing this principle for this reason,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   that I've often found that people are in trouble
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   because they fail to do this very thing that Nathanael did at this point.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Because they don't understand everything,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   they won't accept anything,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   and that's absolutely fatal.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   That is, you see, to put themselves up as judges
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   and into a position of perfection.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   They say, "Ah, yes, this is all right, but I don't understand this and that,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   and because I don't understand this and that, I won't even accept this."
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   And that is the fatal blunder that is made by so many.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   The lesson, therefore, of Nathanael to us is to tell us never to hold back
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   because we haven't understood it all.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Take hold of what you do see and understand.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Hold on to that.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Admit it and confess it.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Let it be known.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Say, "Yes, I see this.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   I have no other explanation."
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   And up to the point that you've arrived at,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   acknowledge it completely.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Very well.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Why do I emphasize it?
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Well, for this reason.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   The moment you do that,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   you will get this gracious promise
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   of greater things to come.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   "Jesus answered and said unto Nathanael,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   believest thou?"
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Now, it's here in the form of a question,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   but I tend to agree with those who say that it shouldn't be put in the form of a question,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   that our Lord is really making a statement.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   He says, "Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   you believe."
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   "All right, Nathanael, this is wonderful, this is excellent,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   and because of that, I say unto you, verily, verily,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Hereafter ye shall see heaven opened,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   thou shalt see greater things than these.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Hereafter ye shall see heaven opened,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Now then, here is to me one of the most encouraging things in the whole of the Scripture.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   The promise of greater things.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Here we are at the end of many, many months of studying this great chapter.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   And yet, you know, my friend,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   we are simply like children paddling on the edge of a great ocean.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Greater things.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   This is the central glory of this blessed life and of this blessed truth.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Now, our Lord emphasizes this by this formula,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   "Verily, verily, surely, surely, amen, amen,"
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   however you like to translate it.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   He always uses this expression when he wants to emphasize something.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   This is of tremendous importance.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   "Listen," he says, "for all your worth.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Verily, verily, truly, truly, I say unto you."
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   And what he said unto Nathanael, he says unto all who are like Nathanael.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   He says this to everybody here this morning
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   who is really genuine and concerned about the state of his or her soul
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   and knowledge of God and really desiring it.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   You may be fumbling, you may be full of doubts and troubles and difficulties,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   but if you are honest, if you are prepared to admit what you do see,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   and if you are prepared to be open, he says,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   "All right, I say to you, you are going to see much greater things than these."
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Now, our Lord, in other words, commends Nathanael's confession.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   He looked at him and he said, "Nathanael, this is wonderful.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   The mere fact that I said to you that I saw you under that fig tree
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   before Philip even approached you,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   that's enough to make your great confession.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Nathanael, this is wonderful.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   I simply said I know all about you, Nathanael,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   and you say to me you are the teacher, the teacher,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   you are the son of God, you are the king of Israel.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Wonderful, Nathanael, but listen, because of this show
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   I'm going to show you infinitely greater things,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   greater things than these shall thou see."
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   He encourages him, he praises him, he leads him on.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   And I'm simply trying to emphasize and to stress this wonderful principle.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   All he demands of us is simple honesty, openness, readiness to listen.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Not that spirit that turns everything down because it doesn't understand,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   but he is ready to receive the suggestion of Philip who says,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   "Come and see, come to him, let him speak to you."
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Openness, once we come to that, he'll take hold of us and he'll lead us on.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   And let us look at these greater things.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   What are they?
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Well, he says, "Thou shalt see greater things than these."
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   You think that's wonderful, that's enough to make you realize
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   that I am the son of God, but my dear Nathanael,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   this is but the beginning, you know.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   And you and I, my friends, must realize that this morning.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   We are but at the beginning of a very great journey, there's no end to it.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   That's the glory, I say, of this Christian life.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   This keeps on emerging in this gospel according to St. John,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   particularly in the eighth chapter.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Later on, we'll find that certain people one day,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   listening to our Lord, they believed on him.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   And he looked at them and he said,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   It's always that.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   There's no end in this life.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Oh, we come to the end of our little seasons, of our little terms.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   We go for a holiday.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Have we finished? No, no, we're only beginning.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   It's just a comma, a temporary pause.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   You go on, there's no end to it.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   "Greater things than these thou shalt see."
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Well, what's he mean by this?
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Oh, I can only give you a number of headings this morning.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Obviously, I can do no more.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Because the whole point of this statement is that it's incomprehensible.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   But it means something like this.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   It means you shall have greater knowledge of me than this.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   This is enough to let you know that I am the Son of God and the King of Israel.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   But you know, Nathanael, that's only the beginning of this knowledge of me that you're going to have.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   And then he goes on to put it like that.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   "Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Now, what does that mean?
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Well, of course, that is a direct reference to what we read at the beginning after the 28th chapter of the book of Genesis.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   That famous incident in the life of the patriarch Jacob.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   The first man who was called Israel.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   His name was changed from Jacob to Israel.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And the Israelites are the descendants of Jacob.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   It seems quite clear that Nathanael, sitting under the fig tree, was meditating about all this.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   So, our Lord, knowing his mind, able to read it in the way we've seen,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   he goes on addressing Nathanael in terms of that very experience that was given to Jacob.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   And here's poor Jacob escaping for his life from the wrath of his brother Esau.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   He deserved what was coming to him, but he escaped.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   And here he is alone this first night, and he's weary and tired.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   There's nowhere to sleep, so he decides he must make a pillow for himself.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   He took a stone and put his head upon it, and he slept.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   And there he had this great dream.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Saw a ladder from heaven to earth, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon it.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And he awakes and he realizes this is the house of God.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   It's the very gateway of heaven.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   God has visited him and has spoken to him.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And that's exactly what it was, of course.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   For the greatest thing that was said to Jacob on that occasion was this,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   "In thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   To this fugitive, this homeless, penniless man running away to save his life,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   God makes this tremendous utterance, "From thee and from thy seed, and through you and your seed,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Out of you ultimately is one to come who shall be the deliverer, the one who will bless the whole world."
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   And so you see what our Lord is really saying to Nathanael is this,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   "I am the fulfillment of that very thing.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   I am the seed of Jacob, the root and the offspring of Jacob.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   I am the one that is sent to be the blessing to all the families of the earth."
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   So what our Lord is really saying to Nathanael is this,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   "Nathanael, the fact that I said to you that I saw you there under the fig tree and read your mind
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   and knew what was passing in your heart,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   that's enough to make you say I am the Son of God.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   But oh, Nathanael, I'm going to show you the whole thing."
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   What? Well, he's going to reveal his own person to him.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   The marvel and the mystery of his person.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Those of us who are Christian, we believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   But you start with that, but that doesn't mean that you have any profound understanding of it.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Who does understand it?
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Two natures in one person, God and man.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And yet that's the truth.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   And the Scriptures lead us on into the knowledge of it.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   And he leads us on through the Scriptures into the knowledge of all this.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   He is the ladder between heaven and earth.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   He is God's way of salvation.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   And the angels of God are his servants.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   He made them, he created them, they're but ministering spirits,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   ministering to him and to the heirs of salvation whom he's come to save.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   He is this great ladder.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   He's the way from man to God, from earth to heaven.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   It's all in him.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And he says, "I'm going to explain this to you and lead you out into its eternities."
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   So it means, you see, something like this,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   that we get a deeper and a greater knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ as prophet and as priest and as king.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Think of somebody who's just become a Christian, and he's pleased with the knowledge he's got,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   but oh, how little it is, it's only the beginning.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   He'll go on to look at this blessed person as prophet, as priest, and as king,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   and he'll go on expanding in that knowledge as long as he lives, and forever and forever.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   And then, of course, the understanding of the great plan and the way of salvation.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Some poor soul in its agony in a chapel on a Sunday morning or Sunday evening or somewhere else,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   suddenly in a flash sees that Christ and him crucified is the Savior,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   and yields himself or herself to him and immediately finds peace.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   And the immediate feeling is, "I've got all I wanted."
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   But you haven't, my dear friend, and thank God you haven't.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   You can be a Christian and still be very ignorant of the plan of salvation.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   And that's what our Lord is saying here.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   What do we know really about justification, sanctification, glorification?
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Tell me, Christian people, have you grasped the doctrine of the Epistle to the Romans?
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Have you really got it? Have you understood it?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   You may have read it hundreds of times.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   I'm asking, do you really understand what Thomas Carlyle would call infinities and immensities?
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Have you understood the doctrine of the Epistle to the Ephesians?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   That's what our Lord's talking about.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Oh yes, you're a Christian, all right.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   You've made that initial act of confession.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   You've seen, you've believed, you've surrendered your life,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   and you think you've got everything, but you haven't, you're only beginning.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   You've got to come into this great doctrine, these profundities,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   baptism with the Holy Ghost, the outfolding of the plan,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   ordained before the foundation of the world,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   and the steps and the stages, each leading to the next.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   And then the mighty doctrine of an epistle like the Epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Christ is our great High Priest.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   You remember the author of that epistle?
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   He has to tell those Hebrews to whom he's writing, he says,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   "You know, I've got many things to tell you about our Lord as the great High Priest,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   but I find it very difficult to do so because you are still so dull of hearing.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   You haven't exercised your faculties, you can't follow me."
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   And so it is still.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   And so what our Lord is saying is this.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   He's giving great encouragement to all who've started,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   and who may think for a moment they've got everything, but they haven't.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   He says, "Look here, this is nothing, greater things than these.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   I'll lead you on, I'll reveal myself to you,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   and the truth concerning me, and all that I have come to accomplish,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   and God's great and glorious and eternal purpose."
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Well, here it is, I say.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   "These are some of the greater things,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   rarely entering into the depths of justification,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   and sanctification, and glorification,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   and his eternal kingdom of righteousness and of peace which is coming, all this.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   It isn't clear at first, but he will reveal it to us, greater things than these."
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   It means that.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   But thank God it isn't all objective.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   There is also the subjective side to this, the subjective element.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   He is telling us that we can have yet greater and greater experiences of his grace.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   In this life you grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And thank God for this experimental side also.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   There is nothing, again I say, more fascinating about this Christian life
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   than the stages in experience.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Each one seems to be perfect when we receive it, and it satisfies us completely.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   And we tend to think we've got it all, and that there's nothing further to happen.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   But my dear friends, the answer to that is,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   "Greater things than these will I show unto you."
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   What's he talking about?
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Well, he's talking about manifestations of himself.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Christian people, you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   But let me ask you a question.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Do you know him?
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Do you know him personally?
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   This is what he's promised.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you."
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Do you know that?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   You see, to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ is only the beginning.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   He says, "You start there, I'll take you on.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Greater things I'll reveal."
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Listen, let me go on.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Verse 21 in John 14.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   "He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me;
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him."
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   You see, to believe on him is only the first step.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   It's the Nathaniel step.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel."
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   But you don't stop there.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   "I will manifest myself to him, unseen yet forever at hand."
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   "I need thee every hour, stay thou nearby."
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Listen, he goes on.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Jesus answered and said, "If a man love me, he will keep my words,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   and make our abode with him."
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   What do we know of these things, my dear friends?
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   This is experience.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   "I will manifest myself unto him."
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   "I and my Father will come, and we will take up our abode in you."
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   "When once thou visitest the heart, then truth begins to shine."
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   What I'm asking is this, is the shining taking place?
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   You believe the truth, but is the truth beginning to shine?
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   The manifestations of the Son of God, the greater experiences.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   You go on and on in this.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   "Greater knowledge of his grace and his love to us."
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   "The realization of his care for us, his concern about us."
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   "The realization increasingly of the possibilities of prayer."
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Greater things than these.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   You read the biographies of the saints,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   and you'll find that they go on and on and on,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   increasing in this knowledge, and they're amazed.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Oh, what do we know about these things?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Do we know these visitations of his presence?
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Can we say with the writer of the hymn,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   "Sometimes a light surprises the Christian while he sings."
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   "It is the Lord who rises with healing in his wings."
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   "When comforts are declining, he gives the soul again."
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   "A season of clear shining to cheer it after rain."
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Beloved Christian people, do you know that sort of thing more and more?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Do you know these seasons of clear shining,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   cheering you after the rains and the cloud and the thunder
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   and the darkness and the oppression?
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   This is what he promises.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   "I'll give you a knowledge of myself that will ravish your heart
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   and amaze you and astound you."
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Not merely an intellectual objective knowledge,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   but an experimental subjective knowledge in an increasing manner.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   That's what he's promising Nathaniel.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   And that is his promise still to all who truly seek him.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Let me close then by putting it like this.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Why is it that these greater things are always possible?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   How is it that our Lord can make this great promise
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   and give this great encouragement?
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   Now here again is something that makes Christianity unique.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   There is no end to it, I say,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   and there is ever this glorious possibility of the greater things
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   for these two main reasons, perhaps three.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   First, because he is who he is.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   You see, Christianity is the knowledge of a person.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   It isn't merely the knowledge of a book.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   You learn about the person in the book,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   but the book in a sense only introduces you to him.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   You can encompass a book, you can master a subject as it were,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   but oh, here you're in the realm of persons
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   and you're face to face with this blessed person.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And there's no end to the knowledge.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   That is why the Apostle Paul, towards the end of his life,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   writing in prison, calling himself an old man,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   is able to say to the Philippians,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   this is, he says, this is one desire,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   that I might know him.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   What? Paul, the Apostle, saying he wants to know him?
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Oh yes, it's because he knows so much of him
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   that he knows that there's so much more to be known.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   At the end of his life, this mighty Apostle,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   that I might know him
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   being made conformable unto his death,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection from the dead.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   The more you know of him,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   the more you know that you'll never know him fully.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Oh, because he is who and what he is.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   What is he? Well, the Apostle Paul describes him like this,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   That's it.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   And then he goes on to say about him,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   in whom dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   That's the one you're getting to know.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   And there's no end to it.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   So you see, let me read these great words of the Apostle Paul to you.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   He's praying for the Ephesians.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   And this is what he says he's praying for them.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Listen, that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   may be able to comprehend with all saints
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   what is the breadth and length and depth and height,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   that he might be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   That's it, and there's no end to it.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   That's why it's ever greater things.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   He is a never-ebbing sea.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   There is no end.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   There is no limit to him, to the glory of his person.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   God, man, absolute in birth respects.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And you'll go on knowing him increasingly forever and forever,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   but also because of the exceeding riches of his grace.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   We're only beginners, my dear friends.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   We're only at the outset.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   We are still just past the introduction.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   We are only just putting our heads in through the door from the vestibule.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Here it is. What is it? What am I talking about?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Well, I'm talking about what the apostle Paul describes in these terms,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   the exceeding riches of his grace.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   He goes beyond that, the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   That's what we're after, and we're entering in greater things.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   You see, this life that we are in,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   this knowledge of the truth concerning him,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   this knowledge of him and of his grace,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   is something that is described so perfectly in prophecy by the prophet Ezekiel.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   You remember how in chapter 47,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Ezekiel describes a great vision that he had
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   of a river coming out from under the altar in the temple
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   and flowing in an eastward direction.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And it's an amazing river.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   It goes on and it gets deeper and deeper.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   At first he says, "I was in it, water up to the ankles."
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   On he went a thousand cubits, and the water was up to the knees.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Another thousand cubits, waters to the loins.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   And then another thousand cubits,
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   and it was a river that I could not pass over,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   for the waters were risen, waters to swim in,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   a river that could not be passed over.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   That's it.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   This life is like some such river.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Have you ever seen the source of one of these great rivers?
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   I was being taken by some friends one afternoon to see the source of the Severn.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   And it was just a little trickle away up in the mountains.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   But you go on and on and down the valleys,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   and you arrive at the town of Shrewsbury,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   and down you go, and eventually the Bristol Channel,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   the mighty Severn.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   At first it seems nothing but a trickle,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   a little mountain brook, a river lip.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   But on it goes and it deepens and it widens,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   and this glorious life is like that.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   It goes on and on, and you and I go on,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   till in the ocean of Islam,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   we lose ourselves in heaven above.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   And then, of course, the other reason why we ever go on
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   to greater and greater things is this.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Because of our state and condition.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   You see, it isn't only the greatness of this person
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   and the glory of his salvation.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   It is the possibility of growth in us,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   because of the life that he's put into us.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   So John writes to little children, to young men, to old men, fathers.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   That's it.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   You're born again, you're a babe in Christ.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   You begin to develop and mature, you become adolescent.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   You go on to middle age, you become an old man and a father.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   But all the time you are growing in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   and there is always room for this increase and for this growth.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   Listen again to the apostle putting this in his own perfect and incomparable manner.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Here he says, "We are as Christians, and this is our position.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   We all, with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   are chained into the same image from glory to glory,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   even as by the Spirit of the Lord."
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   That's it.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   And again he puts it like this in 1 Corinthians 13, in a famous passage.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   "Now we know in part and we prophesy in part,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   but when that which is perfect is come,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   then that which is in part shall be done away."
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   I thought as a child, but when I became a man,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   I put away childish things.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   For now, we see apostles, prophets, martyrs, ordinary Christians,
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   we see now whatever you've got only through a glass darkly.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   But then, face to face,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   "Now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as also.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   I am known."
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   "Nathanael, because I said unto thee,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   I saw thee when thou wast under the fig tree, thou believest."
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   "Greater things than these shalt thou see.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   I'm going to lead you on."
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   And these are some of the things to which he leads us, Christian people.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   Is all this true of us?
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Have you really got life in you, something vital,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   something that grows and develops,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   something in which there must be an increase?
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   There is nothing so appalling to me as to hear certain people speak at times
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   as if they think they've got everything.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Any Christian teaching which tells you that you've got it all is a lie.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   There are people who say, "I've got it all,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   all I have to do now is to abide in what I've got."
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   My dear friend, you're denying one of the most glorious principles
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   of the New Testament. No, no.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   You're only beginning.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   You're only peddling at the edge of the ocean.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   Go on, launch out into the deep.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   Go out, launch out.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Set sail upon the ocean of Islam.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Shall I then close by putting it like this to you?
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   What do you see this morning when you look back across your Christian life and experience?
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   Are you advancing?
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   Are you increasing?
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   You know, it's a terrible thing that people simply go on talking about their conversion.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Some never seem to have advanced a step ever since they're always talking about that.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   It's all right, it's wonderful, but you know that's beginning Nathaniel, greater things.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   Do you know him better this morning than you did a year ago?
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Do you know his love and his grace and his compassion?
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   Do you know the value of prayer more than you did?
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   These are the questions.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   It's always going on, greater things.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   How then do we face the future?
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Well, he tells us, the Apostle Paul tells us as well as our blessed Lord.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   He says this is the way, this is the prescription if you like.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   For getting the things that are behind and pressing forward to the things that are before.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   You press toward the mark, the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   Or let me put it like this again in terms of 2 Corinthians 3, 18.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   We all with open face behold him.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   That means looking at, gazing upon.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   That's the prescription.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   Forget the past.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   Look into his face, dwell with him, meditate with him, behold him.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Beholding as in a glass.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   The glory of the Lord.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   That was the Apostle Paul's great secret.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   So that when he's in a world of troubles and anxieties and tribulations he can look at them all and he can say.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   While as long as we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   For the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   While we look he will lead us on.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   And the truth concerning us will be this. Changed from glory into glory.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   Till in heaven we take our place, till we cast our crowns before him.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Lost in wonder, love, and praise.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Greater things, my friends, await us. Let us anticipate them. Let us look forward to them.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Let us confess what we've got. Let him lead us on.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   Until in the ocean of his love we lose ourselves in heaven above.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Amen.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   The closing hymn is hymn number 179, 179.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Love divine, all loves excelling. Joy of heaven to earth come down.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   Fix in us thy humble dwelling, all thy faithful mercies.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Crown 179.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   [music]
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   Love divine, all loves excelling. Joy of heaven to earth come down.

[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   And now unto him who is able to keep us from falling, and to present us faultless
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit, abide and continue with us
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   now throughout the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage,
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   and until we shall cast our crowns before him, lost in wonder, love, and praise. Amen.
