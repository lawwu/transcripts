[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.920]   Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, in the second chapter and the eighth verse,
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.520]   the eighth verse in the second chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.000]   which none of the princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.280]   crucified the Lord of Glory.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.800]   Let me read to you also verses six and seven.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.280]   Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world,
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.040]   nor of the princes of this world that come to naught.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:55.080]   And we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:05.240]   before the world unto our glory, which none of the princes of this world knew, for had
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:13.920]   they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:23.500]   We are met together this morning in order that we may look together at and consider
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:31.000]   the death of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.640]   And I propose to do that with you this morning in terms of these words which I have just
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.360]   read to you out of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.860]   There are many views given of the cross in the New Testament.
[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.680]   It is the center, it is the great theme, and we can stand and look at it from different
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.720]   aspects and different angles, and each one of them is profitable.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.080]   But this morning I say let us look at it in the light of what the apostle tells us here
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.080]   in these verses.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:13.240]   And at once he confronts us with what is, I suppose, the most striking fact of allâ€”namely,
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:24.240]   that the cross of Christ divides the whole world into two groups, those who see what
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:33.520]   it means and understand what it means, and, on the other hand, those who do not, which
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.400]   none of the princes of this world knew.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.520]   They did not know.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.280]   Had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.840]   They did not.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.920]   But there are those, as the apostles, who do.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.240]   But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.240]   What?
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.160]   Well, these things concerning the cross and the person and the meaning of it all.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.520]   Very well, then, we start with this great fact, and it is as true today as it was in
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.280]   the days of the apostle.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.760]   The whole world this morning can be divided into these two great groups.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.120]   There are people who are aware of the fact that something happened on that cross on Calvary's
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.240]   hill so long ago, but it means nothing to them.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:27.400]   They do not understand it, they do not see it, and there are others to whom it is everything.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.520]   Well now, why is this?
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:37.000]   Why does the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ divide humanity in this extraordinary manner?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.400]   The apostle at once gives us the answer to that question, and the answer is that there
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.480]   is an element of mystery in it.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:54.640]   We speak, he says, the wisdom of God in a mystery; it is a hidden wisdom.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.160]   That is why the cross divides people into these two groups.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:07.040]   There is this element of mystery in the cross, and it is essential that we should understand
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.320]   what this means, not only that we ourselves may truly understand what happens on the cross,
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.200]   but that we may at the same time understand why it is that the cross divides the human
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.720]   race into these two sections.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.040]   The wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom, well, it conveys these ideas.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.560]   First of all, there is of necessity, according to this statement of the apostle, a hidden
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.080]   element in the cross.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.600]   In other words, as you stand and look at the cross, you have to start by realizing that
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.920]   it is not simply what it appears to be.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.560]   There is a man dying upon a tree.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.840]   Well, that is a fact, yes, but the apostle says it is not only that there is a hidden
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.920]   meaning, there is this element of mystery.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.520]   There is something there deeper than can be seen upon the surface.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.720]   That is the first thing.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.240]   The things are not what they seem.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.680]   There is no such thing as a brute fact.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.560]   There is fact plus the meaning of the fact.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.520]   Well, it is because this meaning, the real essence of what is happening there, is a mystery,
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.920]   is hidden and is concealed, that there are those who see nothing in it but just the death
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.320]   of a man.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.880]   Then the second point about the mystery is that this element, this hidden element, is
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:49.200]   something that is inaccessible to human wisdom, human understanding, human ability.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.920]   Now, that is, as you know, well, the great theme of the apostle in these first two chapters
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.700]   of this first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.800]   The world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.200]   They were trying to find God but they couldn't.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:09.880]   Wisdom means human ability, human understanding, philosophy, thought, meditation, an attempt
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.760]   to discover and to arrive at the truth.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.360]   But here the apostle reminds us that this hidden element in the cross, this mystery
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.520]   that is at the very heart and centre of the cross, is something that a man can never arrive
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.720]   at just by searching and investigation.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.840]   This is not to derogate from men's natural ability, but it is to say that there is a
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:41.320]   quality about this and about this truth which eludes human power and understanding.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.160]   Man by searching can find out many things.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.360]   Our age is constantly bursting with it.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.840]   It is an age of discovery, an age of invention, an age in which man is mastering so many things
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.160]   that formerly had mastered men.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:04.240]   But all that ability and ingenuity, all that excellence which is so true in many respects,
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:12.360]   when you come and apply it to this cross on Calvary's hill, avails you nothing.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:19.380]   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.360]   unto him.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.920]   Neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.680]   So you stand and look at the cross, and you are reminded that there is something there
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.520]   which is elusive, a mystery, and you are told immediately, "Well, it is no use your attempting
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:44.080]   to understand it or to grasp it by your own innate natural powers, it is beyond that,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.600]   it is a hidden mystery."
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.120]   And that leads us to the obvious next point, the third point, which is this.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:58.400]   That this mystery, this elusive element, this heart and center of the meaning of the cross
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:05.720]   is something that is only understood as the result of revelation, the result of the operation
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.920]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:14.520]   God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit, for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea,
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.240]   the deep things of God.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.560]   No man, I say, can arrive at this knowledge by his own effort; indeed, there is only one
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.600]   way whereby a man can ever know the truth about the cross, and that is that God should
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.160]   reveal it unto him by his Spirit.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:38.080]   The Spirit was sent to reveal the things of Christ, to glorify Christ, and it is only
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:45.840]   he that can enable us to see and to catch and to understand the mystery of the cross
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   of Christ, and that leads us to this final point, which is this.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:09:00.560]   That as the result of this revelation, when we do receive it, two things happen to us.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:08.800]   The first thing is that we find that the cross turns out to be something almost exactly opposite
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.440]   of what we had always thought.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.680]   We look at it again, and we see it with new eyes, and we not only see something that we
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.520]   had never seen before, we see something that amazes us and astounds us.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.240]   The cross is altogether different from what it appears to be at first sight.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.800]   You look at it as a natural man, and you see something; you look at it as a spiritual man,
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.400]   you see something altogether different.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:44.080]   And the second result is that what we do see now with the illumination of the Spirit is
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:53.080]   the most glorious and wonderful thing that has ever happened in this world.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:10:00.600]   We discover here, I say, the central glory of the Christ and of God, the most amazing
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.000]   thing that the world has ever known.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.520]   It is not surprising, my friends, that when Isaac Watts came to write about it in one
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.720]   of his hymns, he should have chosen the word "survey."
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:23.520]   "When I survey," ah, the people at the foot of the cross, on that occasion, they just
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.880]   looked at it, they glanced at it, but the moment your eyes are enlightened by the Spirit
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:35.720]   and anointed with that eye salve, you stand and you survey it, you go round and look at
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.280]   it from the other side, you keep on looking at it, you come back to it, you spend your
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.680]   life in surveying the cross.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.680]   Why?
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.680]   Well, because of this glory of the hidden mystery, because of the wonder of it all,
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.680]   because of the depth of meaning, its endlessness.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.640]   Well what is this?
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.520]   Well let us try to look at it together and allow the Apostle to lead us as we do so.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:07.200]   But let me ask you a personal question before I proceed.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.080]   What is the cross to you?
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.480]   Into which of these categories do you fall?
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.400]   How much time do you spend in thinking about the cross?
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.640]   Have you seen an element of mystery?
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.480]   Have you seen something that is hidden?
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.240]   Oh, we can test it very easily.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:39.800]   A man who really sees the cross and its meaning is a man who glories in it.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:48.200]   He sees the glory, and the result is that he glories in the cross.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.080]   Is it something at which we look casually, or do we spend time with it?
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:12:00.520]   Are we more and more amazed and astounded as we look at it and as we consider it?
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.880]   These are the things that happen inevitably, I say, when our eyes are open to the mystery
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.880]   of the cross.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.640]   Well now then, in what ways do these things happen?
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.960]   I say that when a man looks at the cross as he is, he just sees something, then his eyes
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.600]   are enlightened and he sees something different.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.040]   How does that kind of thing happen?
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.760]   Well, let me suggest some headings such as this.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:33.520]   There is a mystery in the cross as regards the one who is being crucified, the one who
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.200]   is dying.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:43.040]   You come and you take your stand with the populace of Jerusalem, and you look at those
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.280]   three crosses, and you look particularly at this middle one because there has been such
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:53.160]   a tumult and a great deal of shouting concerning him, this prophet of Nazareth, and here he
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:13:00.160]   is nailed to a tree between two robbers, two thieves.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.920]   And you look at him with everybody else, and what do you see?
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.420]   Well, you see a man.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.840]   You see a man who has been crucified.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.160]   Nails have been driven into both his hands and into both his feet.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.840]   And you look at him and you see not only a man, you see an ordinary man, a common man,
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.840]   not a prince.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:26.840]   He has got a crown on his brow, but it is a crown of thorns.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.000]   He looks an ordinary man, and he looks a very weak man.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.640]   Though he had preached, and though he had made some very exalted and striking claims,
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.760]   he was arrested without any difficulty at all, tried and condemned, oh, the whole thing
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.360]   had happened so easily and so quickly, gives an impression of weakness.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.560]   The other two men appear to be much stronger.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.760]   He seems to be swooning, he seems to be dying very rapidly, whereas crucifixion is a very
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.800]   slow form of death.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   Who is this?
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.320]   Well, that is what you see as you look at him, and above everything you see a case of
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.480]   apparent failure.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.080]   One who talked about himself a great deal and about a kingdom which he was going to
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.480]   bring in, but here he is, taken and crucified in weakness, and he is dying before our very
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.480]   eyes.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:23.760]   You look at him and you say he was despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.920]   acquainted with grief.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.760]   That was the view that was taken of him by so many, wasn't it?
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:37.360]   It was the view taken of him by these princes of this world, these rulers, these governors,
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:45.720]   high priests, Pharisees, scribes, Herodians, and all the others.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.300]   They saw but a man, I say, and an imposter, someone who was dangerous to the political
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:56.120]   situation of the Jewish nation at that time, who might get them into trouble with the Roman
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.120]   authorities.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.760]   That was their view of him.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.660]   They saw just a man, and a man who was being put to death in weakness, and whose claims
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.660]   to power were obviously ridiculous, others he saved, himself he cannot save.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:13.640]   "If thou be what thou hast claimed to be, come down, save thyself, save us also," said
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.440]   that one thief.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.980]   So as you first look, that is what you see, and that is what so many in the world see
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.980]   this morning.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:29.000]   This Jesus, this teacher, to some a political agitator, to others a moral teacher, and so
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.300]   on, they see nothing but a man, and a man dying in apparent failure.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:43.280]   But oh, the moment your eyes are enlightened, a complete transformation takes place, which
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:49.960]   none of the princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.960]   him.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.960]   Who is he?
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:58.080]   They would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:04.160]   This is the most exalted title that the apostle ever gives to our Lord anywhere in any of
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.840]   his writings, "the Lord."
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.380]   Ah, he commonly calls him that, but here he brings in this other term, "glory."
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:21.240]   The Lord of glory, complete deity, there is no higher title than this, with all the glory
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   and the fullness of the Godhead in him.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:37.500]   This is not merely a man, this is not merely a human teacher, this is the Lord of glory.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.880]   Though arrested and condemned and dying in apparent weakness and unable to do anything
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:48.800]   for himself, he is the Lord, the Lord who has come from the eternal glory, the Word
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.400]   that has been made flesh, the one through whom all things were made and without whom
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.980]   nothing was made that was made, the effulgence of God's glory, the fullness of all his
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:04.800]   eternity, the Lord of glory.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.540]   You see, here is the mystery of the cross, here is the paradox.
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:17.960]   The Lord of glory, crucified, the creator and sustainer of the universe, the one in
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:28.680]   whom and by whom all things consist, expiring and dying, ah, this is a mystery, my friends.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:45.360]   By looking at him, you can see him veiled in flesh, the Godhead seen, a incarnate deity.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:53.160]   We, says the apostle John later, beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:18:02.520]   the Father, full of grace and truth, the man Jesus, the carpenter, the ordinary man, apparently,
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:07.880]   we beheld his glory, and this is what you see in the cross, your first glance, man dying
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:16.000]   in failure, the second glance, the Lord of glory, the creator dying.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.360]   Well there it is, the element of mystery in the person who has been crucified and who
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.360]   is dying upon the cross.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.400]   But come, let us take a second bite.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:30.360]   I am merely giving you some headings for your subsequent meditation this morning.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:37.440]   Let us look for a moment at the mystery as regards the people who crucified him.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.880]   And again, you find this same paradox, this same hidden mystery.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.560]   Who are these people who have condemned him and who are crucifying him?
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.040]   Well, they are the princes of this world.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:55.840]   That means, I say, they are the leaders, they are the rulers, they are the authorities.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.880]   And you look at them and contrast them with him, and you say, my, what able people, what
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.680]   wise people these are.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.440]   All these people who have rejected him and who crucify him, all the greatest people amongst
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.880]   the Jews, all their great religious leaders, Herod, the king, and his party, and the Greek
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:20.220]   philosophers agree, the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness.
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.240]   It is to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks, foolishness.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.240]   Why?
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:32.520]   Well, because of their great wisdom, because of their great learning, knowledge, and understanding.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.840]   And then obviously they are people of great power, because they have got power to take
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.520]   him and to condemn him and to arrest him.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.520]   And they are people who are triumphant.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.240]   He has been disturbing them.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.720]   The Pharisees and scribes could see him stealing their congregation.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.080]   The Herodians thought there was a danger of his setting up as a king.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:55.160]   The Roman Empire indeed began to fear there was a possible insurrection.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.200]   And so they all joined together, and they have triumphed.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:03.080]   There they are, full of their wisdom, and understanding, and knowledge, and triumph.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:08.440]   They mock him, they scoff at him, they deride him, they cry out saying, "Hail, king of the
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.680]   Jews!"
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:17.360]   And they commit him and consign him to death.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.360]   That's the impression you get of them as you look at them, isn't it?
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.720]   And it is still the same in this modern world.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.760]   It is as true to say today as it was then, you see your calling, brethren, how that not
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:35.200]   many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.280]   The so-called intellectuals and great thinkers and philosophers today are not interested
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.280]   in the cross.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.920]   They see nothing in it at all.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.240]   He was just a man.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.240]   He was just a teacher.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.320]   Perhaps a religious genius, but there's no significance, there's no meaning there.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.200]   They see nothing of what we see there.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:56.240]   And no, not many wise men after the flesh, the wise, the great, they seem to be rejecting
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   him.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:02.320]   And the kings and princes and powers, they're all set against him, against the Christ, and
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.840]   against God, and against his anointed.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.760]   The apostle Peter reminded them of all that you remember in his sermon on the day of Pentecost,
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.920]   which you'll find in the second chapter of Acts.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.560]   You'll find it again in chapter four.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:21.400]   There they are, these great people who have condemned this felon to the cross.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.840]   But wait a minute.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.640]   Let's look at them again.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:34.120]   Let's look at them as our eyes are anointed by the Holy Spirit, and what do we find?
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.200]   Appalling ignorance.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:41.160]   Here are men who claim to have insight and understanding.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.120]   They're not like the common people, they're the rulers.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:49.400]   They read, they think, they meditate, they argue, they're capable of logic.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.400]   And here they are.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.400]   But look at them again.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   What fools!
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.960]   All their wisdom has been made folly.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.640]   God hath made foolish the wisdom of the wise.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.000]   God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.160]   Wise men, I say, here are the biggest fools that the world has ever known.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.560]   With all their knowledge and learning and understanding and insight, they've looked
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.680]   into the face of the Son of God, and they haven't seen it.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:22.200]   They've seen a man, a felon, and they've dismissed him.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:29.600]   Thus with the eyes enlightened by the Holy Spirit, the wise are made foolish, are made
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.400]   to appear utterly ridiculous.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.840]   Oh, and this wisdom of theirs, what is it?
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:44.120]   Well, says the apostle, it is only the wisdom of this world, albeit we speak wisdom among
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.360]   them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.720]   And that is what their wisdom is.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:55.400]   The wisdom of the wise men of the world today is a wisdom that belongs to this world only.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.600]   How narrow it is, how circumscribed, how small.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.160]   Ah, but you say, look at them splitting the atom, isn't that marvelous?
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.560]   No, it's bound by this world.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:13.160]   That's not eternal, that's not infinite, that's not absolute.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:18.680]   It's a human wisdom, it's a worldly wisdom, and it has its small, its narrow limits.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:24.120]   It's all within the bounds of this world, and listen to them talking cleverly and learnedly.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.360]   What are they talking about?
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.720]   Well, they can only talk about the visible and the seen.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.080]   They know nothing about death.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.480]   They don't understand death.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.960]   Death is to them the terrible calamity.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.640]   That's why most of them, you know, are agitating against the bomb at the present time.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.640]   Death is to them the end.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.680]   They see nothing beyond it.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.040]   They know nothing beyond it.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.040]   It's the wisdom of this world.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.040]   Death, they don't understand.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   Life, they don't understand.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.440]   Beyond, they know nothing.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:56.760]   Wisdom of this world, circumscribed, narrow, confined.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:02.280]   And not only that, it's a wisdom, so-called, that is always changing.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:07.440]   You hear them saying today that knowledge of twenty years ago was all wrong, irrelevant.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.440]   What was believed a hundred years ago, ridiculous.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:14.880]   We alone know it's a wisdom that's always changing, so that you have no confidence in
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.120]   what you're taught today.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.420]   You know it'll be out of date in twenty years, it'll be ridiculed in fifty years.
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:25.280]   And yet men boast of it, the wisdom of this world, how marvellous, how great, and how
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.280]   wonderful.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.600]   No, no, says Paul, it only belongs to this world, and it's unreliable, it is changing,
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.760]   it is evanescent, it's always passing away.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.760]   But listen to his term.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:42.940]   "Howbeit," he says, "we speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:51.400]   of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to naught."
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:56.260]   And that is always true of the wisdom of this world, it comes to nothing.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.680]   It never gets you anywhere.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.280]   It's fascinating, intriguing, exciting to be studying, putting up theory against theory.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.280]   Where does it bring you?
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.640]   Where is it bringing us today?
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.960]   Look at the state of this country, look at the state of morals, look at the whole state
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.960]   of the world.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.320]   Where has this wisdom brought us?
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.940]   It always comes to naught.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:22.040]   And there it thought it had reached its acme when it dismissed the Lord of glory and crucified
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:28.400]   him upon the tree, and if ever it came to naught, it came to naught there.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.220]   It was its own end.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:34.560]   It is there it's ridiculed because Christ on the cross was taking these principalities
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:39.320]   and powers and putting them to an open shame, triumphing over them by it.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.520]   They thought they were getting rid of him, it is there he gets rid of them, it comes
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.520]   to naught.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:52.360]   And this is not only true of their wisdom but also of their power.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:57.840]   They seemed very powerful as he was dying upon the cross.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:02.360]   But when he rose, their power was made ridiculous.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.200]   And this is the great message of Christianity.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.040]   We are but a small company of Christian people in this great pagan country of ours this morning,
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.040]   amidst the godlessness and the irreligion and the vice and the foulness.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.520]   Babylon is great in might and we are weak, but you know there's a day coming when we
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:24.040]   shall hear the sound, "Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and has become the habitation
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.160]   of devils."
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.520]   It comes to naught.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.360]   And the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:39.840]   the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.800]   the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   us."
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.800]   From what?
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.440]   "From the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, the
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.440]   one they've crucified."
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:27:02.720]   For the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand?
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:09.640]   The world passeth away and the lust thereof, the wisdom and the power of this world comes
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.640]   to naught.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.640]   It's disappearing.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.640]   It seems great.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:18.240]   But look again I say, they're fools, they're blind, they're incapable of seeing the eternal,
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:27.960]   the divine, the absolute, and their power is but temporary and is passing away.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:33.440]   You see when you look at this cross truly, everything is changed, he's changed, the
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.120]   people who did it to him have changed.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.280]   But then let me ask this question.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:42.160]   Let me ask you to consider with me the mystery as to what was really happening on that cross
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:48.200]   when he was crucified and when he died.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:54.400]   And here again as you take your first glance what you feel is this, that these men in their
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:03.120]   ignorance and in their spite and their malice had planned his death and had encompassed
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.680]   it.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:10.640]   You see nothing but shame and tragedy and failure.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.160]   You see these men who hadn't understood him and appreciated him.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.160]   That's what you see.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:20.600]   You see what happened on the cross was that the promising career of this Jewish prophet
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.040]   was suddenly cut short.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.560]   One who seemed to be gathering the people and bringing in his kingdom suddenly put to
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.920]   death and there's the end of it all that seemed so wonderful and so full of promise.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.920]   There it is.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:38.040]   That was what was happening, men putting to death the son of God and there's the end,
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.800]   he dies, he's buried, there it is.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.000]   But let us look again at it and let us now look with eyes enlightened by the spirit of
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.840]   God and do you know what we see?
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.280]   Well according to the apostles what we see there is this, not men doing something but
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.520]   God doing something.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.300]   Did you notice it in the seventh verse?
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:03.640]   We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:09.320]   the world and to our glory.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.280]   What was happening on the cross, men putting the son of God to death, of course, I agree
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:19.880]   that's a fact, that's history, but my friend haven't you seen what's at the back of it?
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:24.160]   And the apostles answer here as it is the answer of the New Testament everywhere is
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.020]   this, that it was God who was doing something there, Peter in preaching again on the day
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:34.640]   of Pentecost at Jerusalem makes the thing quite plain and explicit when he puts it like
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.640]   this.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:43.240]   He tells those people, "Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:48.240]   of God ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain."
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.640]   Did you get it?
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:59.340]   Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken and
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:06.120]   by wicked hands have crucified and slain, there but the instruments, it's God acting?
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:13.060]   What's happening there is not the mere action of men, behind is God.
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:18.100]   The predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of God, we speak the wisdom of God, this thing
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:22.180]   we are preaching the cross, he says, what is it, well this is the wisdom of God in a
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:26.220]   mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained, God's acting.
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:31.620]   And yet not only that we see this.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:39.260]   It is not merely God doing something, it is God doing something that he had decided and
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:49.260]   determined to do before he ever created and made this world, before the world.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.100]   The cross is not an afterthought.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.660]   There are men who comment on the Bible and say, and there is a very popular Bible that
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:01.960]   says this, that God sent his son into this world to establish his kingdom but because
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:07.900]   he was not received by the Jews this other thing came in as an afterthought.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.460]   What a lie, what a denial of the Scriptures.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:17.780]   We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:23.700]   the world, before time, before man, before the universe was ever created.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:29.580]   There was this eternal counsel between Father, Son and Holy Spirit, all was known and foreseen
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:34.980]   and the plan of redemption was planned before the creation, before the world.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.540]   That's what's happening on Calvary.
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.540]   Had you seen it?
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:41.340]   Had you just seen the crowd and the populace and the shouting and the rulers and the great
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.300]   people crucifying Jesus?
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.300]   Is that all?
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.300]   No, no, it's God, God doing something that he had planned to do before the very foundation
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.260]   of the world.
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:32:01.660]   And then he goes on to say this, "In doing that, God was giving the most wonderful and
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:09.940]   glorious display of his own wisdom that he has ever given."
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:16.420]   We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God had ordained before
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.140]   the foundation of the world.
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.140]   What's the cross?
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.140]   Well, it's God's wisdom.
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.660]   Can't you see what he's doing, says the Apostle?
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:28.580]   The princes of this world didn't and therefore they crucified, if only, but they hadn't.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.340]   The wisdom of God?
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:35.540]   Had you seen it, says someone, let me put it hurriedly like this to you.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:41.240]   Two great problems were being dealt with on the cross, the two greatest problems that
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.100]   can ever arise and that have ever arisen.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.940]   Here is the first.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.620]   I speak with reverence.
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:33:00.900]   There was a problem in the mind and the heart and in the person of God himself.
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.780]   There was also a problem in man.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:10.260]   Man's problem is this, how can a man be just with God?
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:16.220]   How can a man come to know God and to be blessed by him and to be reconciled to him?
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.220]   That's it.
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.780]   Men had been trying to solve the problem.
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:23.500]   "Men by wisdom knew not God," says the Apostle.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.620]   They'd been trying to, the Greek philosophers had attempted to arrive at this knowledge
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:32.380]   but they deluded them and they'd gone on trying and trying, they couldn't succeed.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:40.260]   There's one problem, how can a man find God and know God and be blessed of God?
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:45.780]   But oh, the other is the greater problem.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:54.460]   How can God possibly have any dealings with sinful men?
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:34:03.940]   How can a God who is holy and pure and just and righteous forgive men and have fellowship
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:11.340]   with him and speak to him and bless him?
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:17.180]   For man is a rebel against God, he has violated his holy laws, he deserves punishment and
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:24.040]   light and darkness can't mix, there's the problem.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:31.120]   But what is happening on the cross, according to the Apostle, is that God is there solving
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:41.180]   that eternal question and problem, the wisdom of God in a mystery.
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:51.940]   God reconciling his own justice and his own love, God bringing together his righteousness
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:35:02.140]   and his mercy, and he did it by laying on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.620]   He solved it.
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:10.540]   He's taken him, his only son, and he's taken my sins and put them upon him.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:17.740]   And he's punished them, he's dealt with them, his justice is vindicated.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:28.460]   And yet his love towards me and his mercy toward me can be manifested in all its fullness,
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.020]   the wisdom of God and the power of God.
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:38.660]   Thus, having dealt with sin and having punished it, God, I say, can look upon us and smile
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:44.580]   upon us and receive us and forgive us and bless us and adopt us into his family.
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:55.420]   The wisdom of God, the eternal problem solved, God reconciling his own attributes and finding
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:36:06.980]   a way whereby he can be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:16.180]   So that brings me to the last mystery, which is this.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.220]   What does all this mean to us?
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:27.020]   Well, as you look at it first and as you begin to understand it, what you feel is this, it's
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:33.360]   my condemnation, it's my shame.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:43.620]   It shows my sinfulness, my weakness, my inability, my utter helplessness in the presence of God.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:49.540]   I look at it and I'm covered with shame.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:59.180]   But I look at it again, listen, we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:10.780]   wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:14.060]   Had you seen it?
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:26.220]   Not your shame, not your sin only, but forgiveness and remission of sins, reconciliation unto
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:40.740]   God, rebirth, adoption, heirship, and in the glorious future, entering into the everlasting
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:46.980]   kingdom, our final glorification.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.900]   That is what is happening there.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:56.020]   The Son of God came down and went to the cross, humbled himself, why?
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:59.500]   That we might be exalted.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.540]   He laid aside his glory, why?
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:07.180]   That he might give us something of his own glory.
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.220]   He did it all unto our glory.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.220]   Well, there it is.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.220]   Have you seen it?
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.540]   Has it been revealed to you?
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:24.740]   Have you seen, when you've looked at the cross, the glory of Christ, the Lord of glory
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:30.380]   dying, the Lord of glory crucified.
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.380]   It is his supreme glory.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.380]   He humbled himself.
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.620]   He made himself of no reputation.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.620]   He took upon him the form of a servant.
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:44.740]   He was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, the glory of the Son, the Lord
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:45.900]   of glory.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:46.900]   Have you seen it?
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:52.980]   Have you seen the glory of God the Father?
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:59.940]   God planning and ordaining it before the foundation of the world.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:06.420]   God in his wisdom, working out a plan and a way to forgive men, and to reconcile him
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:13.700]   unto himself, and to make him his own child, the glory of the Father.
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:23.220]   And have you seen there the glory of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit who enabled him while he
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:30.100]   was here in the days of his flesh to live, and to work miracles, and to endure the strain?
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:36.540]   The eternal Spirit through whom he died gave himself the Spirit that was actively raising
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:43.820]   him from the grave, the glory of the Spirit.
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:56.220]   And the glory of the Spirit as he opens our blind eyes and enables us to see the hidden
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.220]   wisdom.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:03.700]   I ask you, as you look at that cross, do you see that?
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:11.040]   The glory of the Son, the glory of the Father, the glory of the Spirit, and in many ways
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:25.020]   most wonderful of all, your own future, eternal, everlasting glory.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:32.380]   If you do, you will agree with the Apostle Paul that there is only one thing to say.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:41.860]   God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, by which the
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:49.260]   world was crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.940]   Take another look at it.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:59.700]   What you say as you look at it once more, isn't it this, content to let the world go
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:07.580]   by, to know no gain or loss?
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:24.020]   My sinful self, my only shame, my glory, all the cross, which none of the princes of this
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:40.460]   world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory, the
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:52.860]   hidden mystery, the mystery of God, the wisdom of God, the power of God, God in Christ reconciling
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:58.100]   the world unto himself.
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:01.500]   Have you seen it?
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.080]   Do you glory in it?
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:14.100]   Do you see life, eternal, everything, streaming from the cross?
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:26.860]   We preach Christ crucified, Christ the power of God, Christ the wisdom of God.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:33.380]   May God bless all who have seen it and who rejoice in it, and if there be anyone in this
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:41.540]   congregation who has never seen it, who has never seen the mystery and the glory.
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:51.040]   May God, the Holy Spirit, open your eyes and give you just one glimpses, for when I survey
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:59.780]   the wondrous cross on which the prince of glory died, my richest gain, I count but loss
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:06.220]   and poor content on all my pride.
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:13.500]   Look at it, my friends, go on looking at it until the glory flashes upon you, and stay
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:24.140]   there and go back and back and back until it becomes your one interest, your one theme,
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:31.580]   as it will be the one cause of your praise throughout eternity.
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:42.460]   Let us join in singing Isaac Watts's hymn number 131, when I survey the wondrous cross
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:52.100]   on which the prince of glory died, my richest gain, I count but loss and poor contempt on
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:44:02.700]   all my pride.
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:25.860]   When I survey the wondrous cross on which the prince of glory died, my richest gain,
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:44.380]   I count but loss and poor contempt on all my pride.
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:45:01.700]   My sinful self, my only shame, my glory, all the cross, Spirit divine, open our eyes and
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:14.140]   reveal unto us more and more the deep things of God, and now may the grace of our Lord
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:21.700]   and Savior, Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship and the communion
