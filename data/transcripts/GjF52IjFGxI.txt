[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Those who attend here regularly will know that we are looking at this great 107th psalm
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.360]   for the fourth time this evening.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.920]   It's a remarkable psalm judged or looked at from any standpoint whatsoever.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.760]   It's great as poetry.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:30.080]   It's marvelous for its pictures, for the way in which it delineates situations.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.720]   It's dramatic and descriptive purely as a piece of literature.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.360]   It is well worthy of our careful consideration and analysis.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.080]   But of course we are interested in it and concerned about it because of the truth that
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.920]   it contains, because of the message that it has for us.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.920]   And we've been looking at it in this way.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.560]   The man who wrote this psalm sends out a great invitation to people to give thanks unto the
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.760]   Lord for he is good, for his mercy endureth forever.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.360]   Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, he says, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.040]   enemy and gathered them out of the lands from the east and the west and the north and from
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.040]   the south.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.520]   Now, we've been putting the message of the psalm in this form and there can be no question
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.200]   that this was the mind and the intention of the men who composed the psalm.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.400]   He is anxious for all these people to praise God.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.720]   Why?
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.160]   Well, because God is who and what he is, because he is good, because his mercy endureth
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.160]   forever.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.120]   That is sufficient reason for praising God.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.160]   Quite apart from what he does to us directly, God is to be praised because he is God.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.240]   And the real essence of sin is not to praise God.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.720]   That is where we all go so sadly astray, when we tend to identify sin with particular sins.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.440]   That is why some people, of course, feel that they have never been sinners at all, because
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.480]   they have never done certain things.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.840]   If you would like to know whether you are a sinner or not, here is the test.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.420]   Is the whole of your life given to the praise and the glory of God?
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.560]   If it isn't, you are a sinner.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:37.040]   The essence of sin is not to give unto God the glory and the praise that should be our
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.280]   perpetual occupation.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.840]   Now then, this man calls upon them then to praise God, but he doesn't stop at that.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.680]   He calls upon the redeemed in particular to do so, because he has redeemed them from the
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.040]   hand of the enemy.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.920]   His case is this, that the whole of mankind is sinful, and that it is utterly helpless
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.560]   in its sin.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.220]   That it can do nothing at all for itself, try as it will, it cannot deliver itself.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.420]   The only hope for the world, for individuals in the world, is in God.
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.340]   And it is only those who realize their utter hopelessness and helplessness, and who cry
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.360]   out unto the Lord in their trouble, who are delivered and set free.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.120]   And then they will begin to praise God.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.980]   That is his great theme.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.360]   Now then, we can put it like this, and we have been putting it like this.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.480]   There is only one cause to all our troubles in this life and in this world, and it is
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.840]   sin.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.120]   This wrong relationship to God.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:55.440]   But as this man is careful to point out, though there is that one and only cause, that one
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.320]   cause manifests itself in a large number of different ways.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.120]   One disease, but many symptoms.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.000]   And where the devil misleads us is this, that because the symptoms are different, he would
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.040]   have us believe that we are not all suffering from the same disease.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.960]   But according to this man, as according to the whole of the Bible, there is only one
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.620]   disease.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.940]   And though the symptoms differ so greatly on the surface, they really all emanate and
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.020]   stem from the same common root.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.040]   Now that is his thesis, that is his idea, that is his message.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.000]   So that however much we may differ on the surface, he tells us we are all one, we have
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.240]   the same need, there is the same God who alone can satisfy, and he satisfies in the same
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.840]   way.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.640]   If you like it in a phrase, it is this, the essence of the biblical message is to bring
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.840]   us face to face with the common need and the common salvation.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.720]   Now this man announces all that in the first three verses of this psalm.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.720]   But he is not content merely with making a statement.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.840]   He sets out to prove his statement, and he does so in this way.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.520]   He takes four examples and illustrations.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.920]   He paints us four pictures which seem to be absolutely different from one another, and
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.960]   yet if you take the trouble to read it carefully at home, you will find this, that there are
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.480]   certain phrases that come in every single picture, here is one of them, "Then they
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   cried unto the Lord in their trouble," here is another, "And he delivered them out of
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.160]   their distresses," here is another, "Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.400]   and for his wonderful works to the children of men."
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.560]   Those occur in the four pictures.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.200]   In other words, his point is just this, you see.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.880]   He paints his four different pictures, you say they are absolutely different, he then
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.080]   proves to you that they are identical.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.360]   It is only in appearance that they are different.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.600]   Actually and in fact, they are all the same.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.640]   Now then, we have already looked at the first two pictures.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.920]   The first picture was in verses six to nine.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.600]   It was a picture of men travelling in the wilderness looking for a city of habitation
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.400]   which they could not find, and how at last tired and weary and exhausted, with the night
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.360]   coming on rapidly, and their being fearful that they are going to be out all night and
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.360]   perhaps attacked and killed by marauders, they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.760]   immediately he brings them to the city.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.920]   The second picture was this.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:52.600]   A number of men in prison cells, bound and fettered by irons, unable to make their escape,
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.120]   iron bars across the windows, mighty gates of brass shutting off the whole city, the
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:05.200]   whole prison from the outside world, sitting in affliction and irons in the corner in the
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.080]   prison cell, and absolutely helpless.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.560]   That is the second picture.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.400]   And now we come to the third picture.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.120]   Now let us bear this in mind.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:26.160]   All these pictures, I am saying, are just representations of sin, and of what sin does
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.320]   to us.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.960]   The first picture, you see, was a picture of sin as it causes us to miss the mark and
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.000]   to go astray.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.720]   The second picture, which we considered last Sunday night, is a picture of sin as slavery,
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.760]   sin as bondage.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:51.320]   Sin is that which fetters us and enchains us, and dominates our lives.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.120]   Now then, let us go on to our third picture.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:03.000]   Because here, obviously, we have got again what looks and seems to be an entirely different
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   picture.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.840]   At any rate, that is, I say, true on the surface.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.480]   Where are we now?
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:15.840]   Well, we are no longer in a wilderness, looking for a pathway, a great road, going to a city.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:22.000]   Neither are we languishing, or looking at men languishing, in corners in prison cells.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.640]   Where are we now?
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:31.000]   Well, we are just in an ordinary bedroom, in an ordinary house, and we have gone upstairs,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.600]   and we are in an ordinary bedroom.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:41.680]   And we are looking at a poor person lying on a bed, obviously in a very bad and serious
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.680]   condition.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:49.240]   You see, the psalmist is concerned to emphasize that on the surface the thing is absolutely
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240]   different.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.920]   It does not seem to have anything in common with the others.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.520]   You are no longer looking at a man who has got too much room in a wilderness, and walks
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.760]   about so much that he gets tired.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.880]   Neither are you in a man who is there, fettered to a wall with chains, and looking at iron
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.000]   bars, and thinking about great gates of brass.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Not at all.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Quite different.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   It does not seem to have anything in common.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.240]   A very ordinary common scene, this.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:24.960]   Just a man or a woman lying in a bedroom, and in this serious and terrible condition.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.600]   Well, now, what is the picture?
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.560]   Well, obviously the picture this time is this.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:45.160]   It is a picture of sin as disease, sin as sickness, sin as the illness of the soul,
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:50.920]   the sickness of life, the sickness of men.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.120]   Let us adopt the procedure we have adopted on the previous evenings.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.240]   Let us first of all start with the picture, and then let us go on to draw the message
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.800]   and the lessons which are so clearly taught by the picture.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:11.080]   As in the previous instances, the terms are plain and at the same time very graphic.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.080]   What are we looking at?
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.760]   Well, I say we are looking at a sick patient.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.240]   And let us observe him.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.840]   What does the psalmist tell us about him?
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:27.240]   Well, the first thing he says is, just to make the statement, that the man is obviously
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240]   ill.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.240]   He is an ill man.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.200]   He is sick.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.920]   He is suffering from some sort of a disease.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.040]   Not only that, he tells us that he is afflicted.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:47.200]   He is in a state of affliction, which means that he looks miserable.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.240]   He looks unhappy.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.080]   Not only that, he is clearly suffering from pain.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.560]   That is the meaning of affliction.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.120]   He is ill at ease.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.520]   He is troubled.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.520]   Not only that, we can go further.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.000]   We can see certain other obvious things about this man.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.080]   It is quite obvious to us from the description of the psalmist that he has lost his appetite.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:22.320]   Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:27.400]   He does not want any food, and if you bring food into the room, he abhors it.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.560]   It makes him feel ill.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.680]   The sight of it upsets him.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.000]   It makes him feel violently sick.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.560]   Not only does he not want it, I say, but he has got a sense of revulsion against it.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.920]   The most important part of the description.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:46.360]   Its here, their soul abhorreth all manner of meat.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.440]   And of course, as the result of all this, we read that they draw near unto the gates
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.360]   of death.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:00.480]   This patient, in other words, is obviously suffering from some sort of a wasting disease.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.740]   There are many causes of wasting diseases.
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.960]   It may be that he has got some growth.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.360]   It may be that there is some failure in the vital functions of the body.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:17.580]   But whatever the precise cause is, the fact about this man is that he is a desperately
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.420]   ill and sick man.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:26.480]   This condition of loss of appetite and revulsion against food, of course, has meant that he
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.960]   has become very thin.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.080]   He is emaciated.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.560]   And in addition to that, his color is very pale.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.360]   There seems to be no blood in his lips.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:43.560]   There is this awful pallor, this cachexia, this typical appearance of a person suffering
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.800]   from this kind of wasting disease.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.140]   And in addition to all that, of course, and as the result of all this, the patient is
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.840]   desperately weak.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:13:00.040]   He not only has no energy, he can scarcely move at all.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:05.980]   As the result of lack of food and as the result of the loss of flesh, the nutriment which
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.940]   normally is required by the muscles and the nerves and so on, is no longer there.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.800]   And the heart in turn is suffering and is failing.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:23.680]   And the result is this appalling picture of a poor person in a state of inermission, wasted
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:33.160]   and thin and pale and miserable and gasps at every slightest move, lacking in energy.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.400]   Well, the vital spark of life almost seems to have gone altogether.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   They draw nigh, as this man tells us, unto the very gates of death.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.960]   They have lost interest in everything.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.640]   They are utterly miserable and unhappy.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.080]   Everybody has been trying to do everything for them, but nothing can be done and they
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.560]   have given up all hope themselves.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.440]   It is a picture, it is a description, I say, of those who are in a completely hopeless
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:06.520]   state, wasting away in a kind of living death before your eyes, nothing but a kind of living
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.520]   skeleton.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:15.280]   That is the picture which is drawn in these few graphic words and by these deft touches
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.520]   by the men who wrote this song.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.560]   But you notice that he not only paints his picture, but he gives us the explanation of
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:30.080]   it, "Fools, because of their transgression and their iniquity."
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.600]   He says, "I would like that."
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.120]   Now that is our picture.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:41.200]   And I need scarcely remind you that this is perhaps one of the commonest pictures of sin
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.000]   which is given in the Bible, both in the Old Testament and in the New.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And it is a picture, of course, that suggests itself very readily to us.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.040]   Sin as sickness, sin as illness.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:58.440]   There are those who recite Sunday by Sunday in their liturgy that there is no health in
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.440]   us.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.600]   That is their way of saying we are sinners.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.840]   You will read in the Old Testament that it is said of Israel that Israel is sick from
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.280]   the head to the foot and that there is no health in him.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   Perfectly good description.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.520]   It is a marvelous representation of sin.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.400]   The Church from the very beginning has always adopted this picture.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:28.120]   That is why people have always felt that leprosy in the New Testament is a very striking delineation
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.120]   of the effects of sin upon the soul of men.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:37.000]   And there can be no doubt whatsoever that our blessed Lord and Savior did many of his
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.360]   healing miracles when he healed people with this double object and intent.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.400]   It was to show his compassion, but above that.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.480]   It was to give a picture of sin and how he had come to deal with it.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:55.840]   As if he said, "I do this for the body, but I have come to do an infinitely bigger
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.240]   and greater thing for the soul.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.280]   As this body suffered from disease, physical disease, and I have healed it, so the soul
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:10.560]   of men is suffering from a dread disease, a spiritual disease, called sin.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.440]   And I have come to heal it."
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.640]   He used these very terms, didn't he, himself.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:22.840]   He said, "They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick."
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.680]   And there I think is sufficient authority for saying that this is the way in which the
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:35.620]   Bible normally uses this picture of ill health and disease to represent sin.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:42.640]   And if you look at it positively, what is the meaning of the term salvation?
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.440]   It means health.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.960]   It means saving health.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:53.000]   And the whole message, starting with Zacharias at the very beginning, is that the Lord Jesus
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.160]   Christ has come into the world in order to give us salvation.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.440]   Saving health, completeness, wholeness.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.440]   Those are the terms.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.680]   That's the meaning of holiness.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.880]   It's the meaning of all these terms.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.400]   Very well.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:17.840]   Now that being the picture which is drawn and painted by this man, let us now concentrate
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:22.680]   our attention upon the message, upon the doctrine.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.600]   What is he really telling us?
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:30.720]   Well, the first thing you notice is that he tells us exactly what sin is.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:38.480]   He starts off by saying fools because of their transgressions and because of their iniquities
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.960]   are afflicted.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.720]   So the first thing we see about sin tonight is that it is transgression.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.920]   We saw last Sunday night that it meant rebellion.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.640]   It meant a contemptuous rejection of the counsel of the Most High.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.720]   All these descriptions are true.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.800]   There are many things to be said about sin, but tonight we are concentrating on this one,
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.800]   transgression.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.800]   What does it mean?
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.360]   Well, it means this.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:21.440]   It means walking away from and ignoring and offending against what God meant for us, what
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.280]   God meant for men.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.280]   That's transgression.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.880]   Deliberately going against that which God has indicated is his will and his way for
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.880]   us.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.840]   So let us use this very illustration of health.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:45.440]   I can put it to you very simply as to what transgression means.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.160]   Look at it in this way.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:57.320]   There are obviously certain laws of health, and if we want to enjoy health we must observe
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.280]   those laws.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:05.480]   There are certain things that are absolutely essential to health, for instance food.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.480]   You can't be healthy and you can't remain healthy unless you take food.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.600]   It's a law of health.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.680]   Food is absolutely essential, solid and liquid, food and drink as we say.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:25.960]   Yes, and in exactly the same way, fresh air, it's absolutely essential to health.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.220]   Another essential is rest and sleep.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.240]   If you go on working endlessly, well, you're bound to suffer for it.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.760]   It's one of the laws of health.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:41.200]   There are certain laws that simply must be kept if we really are going to enjoy a state
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:47.440]   of health, and if you ignore those rules, you will suffer for it.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.480]   Now you can explain that for yourselves.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.920]   As I say, if you don't eat enough, your health will fail.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.400]   On the other hand, if you eat too much, you'll suffer in your health.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.120]   You see, the law of health is this, that a man should eat the right amount, the appropriate
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.600]   amount, neither too little nor too much.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.240]   There is a right amount, an optimum amount.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.760]   And it's exactly the same way with regard to rest and sleep.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.080]   If you don't take any, well, you may very well have a nervous breakdown.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.240]   If you sleep too much, you'll be dull and lethargic and you'll feel ill again and that'll
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.480]   be the cause of your illness, too much sleep.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:29.760]   And so on with all these other factors and all these various rules of health.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:36.400]   Now transgression means this, that we're not living according to those rules, according
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.280]   to those laws, that we're violating them in some shape or form, that we're going against
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.080]   them, that we're ignoring them.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.960]   Like many a man has done who eats too much or who drinks too much or who doesn't take
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.040]   sufficient rest.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:53.720]   He works in his office all day, then he dances like, goes to parties all night or something
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:59.160]   like that and goes on day after day and night after night and at last he loses his health.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.960]   That's what's meant by transgression.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:09.720]   Now then we must raise this if we are to understand sin into the spiritual realm.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.760]   And it can be put very simply like this.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.400]   God has made men for himself.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:25.040]   He has made him to live according to certain laws and according to certain principles.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:32.000]   And what the Bible tells us in utter simplicity is just this, that if you and I do not live
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.480]   according to the laws and principles of our creation and of our nature, we are going to
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.900]   suffer for it.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:45.040]   That as a man suffers in his physical health if he breaks the laws of physical health,
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:52.240]   so if he doesn't conform to the laws and the arrangements that God has made for his
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:59.960]   total life as a spiritual being, it will lead to unhappiness, it will lead to misery, it
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.520]   will lead to affliction, it will lead to trouble.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.920]   That's transgression.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.680]   And it is because we transgress against the laws of our being that things go wrong with
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.680]   us.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.200]   God has made us for himself.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.720]   He so made us that we cannot thrive and flourish except we are in the right correspondence
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.240]   with him and are receiving from him what he alone can give.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:30.040]   If we don't do that, we shall be afflicted.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.520]   The term iniquities means crimes.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:41.080]   Men in sin not only doesn't live as God meant him to live, he deliberately does things that
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.080]   are wrong.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.680]   That's the difference between a transgression and a crime.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.560]   That's the difference between transgression and iniquity.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.120]   Man in sin, you see, is not in a negative condition.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.880]   It isn't simply that he isn't what God meant him to be.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.680]   He is deliberately something else.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.280]   He is actively something else.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.760]   He has reduced himself to something else.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.520]   He is guilty of crimes.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.800]   He is a criminal.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.160]   Now there, we must leave it in order that we may hurry to other matters.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:21.920]   There, according to this portion we are looking at this evening, is what sin really is.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.560]   That's the thing that is afflicting us all.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.080]   But come, let us go to the second matter, which is this.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:37.680]   What does the Bible say about people who are afflicted because of transgressions and iniquities?
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.360]   And here the statement of this man is very important and very specific.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:48.000]   You notice his first word is the word "fools".
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.840]   "Fools".
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:55.800]   Because of their transgressions and because of their iniquities.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.840]   But let us observe exactly what the psalmist does say.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.600]   I'm afraid this authorized translation isn't quite as good as it might be at this point.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.760]   Let me give you a better translation.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.480]   Here I have been reading to you these words.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:18.080]   "Fools because of their transgressions and because of their iniquities are afflicted".
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.640]   But what this man really said was this.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:32.120]   "Fools by their cause or by their way of transgression and their iniquities afflict
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.000]   themselves".
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.720]   That's it, and that's why they're fools.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.000]   They afflict themselves.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.400]   It isn't that the afflictions come upon them because of what they have done.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.120]   They produce their own affliction.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:52.360]   They bring their afflictions upon themselves.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:25:03.000]   Now this is, again I suggest to you, the very first message of the Bible.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Why is the world as it is tonight?
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.320]   What's brought it to this?
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.520]   Why the tension?
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.280]   Why the trouble?
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.440]   Why the misunderstandings?
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.320]   Why the strain?
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.640]   Why all that internationally?
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.140]   Why all that within the nation?
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.400]   Why all that is between groups?
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.680]   Oh yes, let's be quite plain and specific.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:33.400]   Why that in the individual?
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.480]   Why is anybody unhappy?
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.980]   Why is anybody ill at ease?
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.800]   Why is anybody afflicted?
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.640]   Why are we all by nature in this life and in this world as we are and what we are?
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.640]   What's the matter with us?
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.960]   Is it some coarsed fate?
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:54.680]   Is it some horrible spite of the unseen powers?
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.480]   What is it?
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.240]   The answer of the Bible, my friend, is quite simple.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.000]   It's quite direct.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.840]   We've brought it all upon ourselves.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:15.440]   Fools because of their transgressions and their iniquities afflict themselves.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.040]   Let's be clear about this.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:24.600]   The world is as it is tonight because of the unutterable folly of man.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.200]   It isn't fate.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.680]   It isn't in our stars.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.680]   It isn't outside us.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.680]   It's within us.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.680]   It's in ourselves.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.200]   Isn't that the whole message of the Bible?
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.200]   The world was paradise.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.960]   It's no longer paradise.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   Why?
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   Because man was a fool.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:47.000]   He's brought it all upon himself and this is something that we can never emphasize too
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   much and I do want to emphasize this word fools.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.440]   Oh, I know that it's hated today.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:27:00.000]   I know that it's utterly impossible to people to accept this biblical doctrine of sin.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.560]   They say, "I can't abide that teaching, that we are sinners and that we are responsible
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   for what we are."
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.560]   I don't believe.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:12.200]   My dear friend, whether you believe it or not, it's the simple truth about you.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:19.120]   Every one of us is a fool and this is how we show our folly.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:25.480]   Sin really just means this, that we think that we know better than God.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.680]   That's what man did at the beginning.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.280]   God gave him the ideal, perfect conditions, but he listened to a suggestion that there
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.560]   was a better way, which God was withholding from him and he went into it thinking he was
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.840]   going to advance himself, thinking he was going to do something marvelous and he did
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.840]   it.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.040]   Oh, the fool.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.200]   Because in doing that he's brought affliction upon himself and it came almost at once, you
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.200]   remember.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.000]   Man didn't know what to do with himself in his sin.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.840]   And it's still the same.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:05.080]   We are the architects of our own troubles.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:11.520]   It's because we are what we are and because we do and think the things we do and think
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.640]   that we are as miserable as we are and are surrounded by problems and immersed in difficulties.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.560]   Yes, you are, but you say it's somebody else.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.800]   Yes, but the other person is saying exactly the same thing about you.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.440]   And the fact of the matter is it's true of all of us.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.920]   It's because we're all self-centered and selfish, because we all think we are marvelous and
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.120]   we know how to do.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.960]   We can circumvent God's way.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.900]   We've got the mystic secret.
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:41.480]   We all believe it and we all practice it and we bring our troubles headlong upon ourselves.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:50.640]   And those, because of their transgressions and iniquities, afflict themselves.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:57.520]   In other words, there is nothing in the world that is so subtle tonight as sin.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.280]   Nobody of course ever sets out deliberately to afflict himself.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.320]   Nobody's ever done that.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.120]   Nobody ever will do that.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.280]   But you see, it's in our cleverness that we do it without realizing what we are doing.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.980]   You see, we say we're out for a good time and then we find ourselves in trouble.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.120]   We didn't go into trouble.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.760]   We went in for a good time.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.480]   But we've got trouble.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.480]   Why?
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.240]   Well, because we've transgressed, we've ignored the laws, we've forgotten the principles of
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.240]   health.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.400]   We said we were out for happiness.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.280]   We were simply out for enjoyment.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.600]   We really didn't want to be miserable.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.800]   We wanted to be happy.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.960]   Now that's the extraordinary paradox of the world this evening.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.000]   Look at your newspaper, see the accounts of the misery and the unhappiness.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.440]   Stand on a street corner and just watch people.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.560]   Why is the world so unhappy?
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.280]   In a sense, the answer is this.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.400]   They're all out for happiness.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.520]   Everybody tonight is chasing happiness.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.080]   The result is unhappiness.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   Why?
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.720]   Well, because we are not seeking it in the right way.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.720]   That's the folly of sin.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.880]   That's where we are deluded by sin.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.400]   It's there the subtlety of sin comes in.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:09.640]   We think we're out for the best, we find the worst.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:15.480]   But let me work it out a little more in detail under a third principle, by asking you to
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:23.640]   consider with me the results to which sin inevitably always leads.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:33.720]   And the answer I've already given you in the picture, it is always this wasting disease.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:41.760]   It's always this picture of that poor, sick, dying person lying so helplessly upon that
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.520]   bed.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.520]   Shall I put it to you in the form of a principle?
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.440]   Well, let me put it like this.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:58.600]   Sin always robs us and always takes away from us.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.560]   Don't you see there again the subtlety of it all?
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:10.120]   Sin comes to us as the best friend we've got in the world who is offering us everything.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:15.680]   And yet I am asserting this, and I am going to prove it to you, that sin never gives us
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:22.360]   anything at all, but always takes from us and robs us.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.160]   Invariably.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:30.600]   It's all in the parable of the prodigal son, if you like.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.160]   There was a kind of life that appealed to him, it was going to give him so much.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.760]   Do you know from the moment that boy left home he was being robbed, until at last he
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:44.120]   was penniless, sitting there in the field amidst the husks of the swine?
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.120]   That's what sin always does.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:57.120]   Forgive me if I use a kind of medical or itinerant pharmological illustration.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:02.920]   Everything I'm trying to say, you know, is illustrated perfectly in alcohol.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.080]   You ask a person what alcohol is, and I think you'll find invariably that they'll tell
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.600]   you that alcohol is a stimulant.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   But you know, the pharmacologists don't classify alcohol as a stimulant, they always
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.600]   classify it, and rightly, as a depressant.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.840]   "Ah, but you see, that's impossible.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.160]   Alcohol does stimulate us.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.840]   If a man's tired and he drinks a glass of whiskey, he feels full of energy, he's
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.720]   brightened and he's enlivened.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   Surely alcohol must be a stimulus."
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.720]   But my friend, it isn't.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.660]   Do you know how it works?
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.000]   What that alcohol does to you is this.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.960]   It knocks out your highest faculties, your highest centers, and it knocks out all control,
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.840]   in other words.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:53.720]   And the result is that a kind of elemental power and vigor that is in you, which is normally
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.760]   balanced, becomes imbalanced, and you feel you've got more energy.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.640]   You haven't any more energy at all.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:05.760]   It's something that by knocking off the control has released something for the time being,
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:12.800]   and at the end you're more exhausted than you were before.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.040]   How subtle it is.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:20.680]   Then let me put it to you in terms of pharmacology.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:26.560]   Any alcoholic drink always makes one feel much warmer.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.080]   That's common knowledge, isn't it?
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:33.000]   All right, but if you read the textbooks, and indeed if you listen to the advice of
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.600]   people, you'll find this, that they always tell you never to take alcohol before you're
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.960]   going out into the cold air.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.960]   Why not?
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:48.520]   Well, you see, because what alcohol does to you is not to increase the heat that is in
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:53.400]   you, which you think it's doing, what it's really doing is to dilate your surface vessels,
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.160]   and you have a sensation of heat because you're losing heat.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:03.360]   So the alcohol doesn't give you more heat, it drains you of heat, and gives you a pleasant,
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:08.200]   warm, comfortable feeling because you are emanating more heat for the time being, and
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:15.280]   in the end you're much colder and therefore more subject to a chill.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.560]   Now I say that that is a perfect picture of sin.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:24.040]   Sin always robs and takes from us.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.280]   What does it take from us?
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:32.000]   Well, let me suggest some of the things to you that are suggested to me by this picture.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.440]   Sin always robs us of innocence.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.760]   Adam and Eve were innocent until they sinned.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:47.160]   The moment they listened to the devil, they'd lost their innocence.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:51.320]   Don't misunderstand me, I don't accept the philosophy of the late J.M.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.720]   Berry with his Peter pen, but there is such a thing after all as a relative innocence
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.480]   at any rate.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:05.640]   And we all start in this world with a relative innocence, but the moment you sin, you've
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.280]   lost it.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:15.840]   It robs us of innocence, it robs us of purity, it robs us of refinement.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:22.320]   The moment we play with sin and commit it, we've lost a certain refinement.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:27.000]   A certain coarseness always comes in when you sin.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.380]   You see it in people's faces, don't you, what a terrible thing sin is, how it coarsens
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:38.560]   the very complexion, thickens the very visage, as it were.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:44.160]   A man can't go on sinning, but it will show itself in his eyes, in his skin, in his hands
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.920]   everywhere, in his body.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.960]   There's a coarseness, a roughness.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:53.840]   It robs us of refinement and delicacy.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:59.360]   Not only that, sin always robs us of balance and of judgment.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:04.880]   I think I've pointed out to you before that that is the sole explanation of the supposed
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:11.160]   brilliance of the after-dinner speaker who's taken a little drink.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.320]   It isn't that he's been unusually brilliant, it's that he's been saying things which normally
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:20.120]   he wouldn't have said, because the alcohol has knocked out his control, and the same
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.120]   has happened to the people who are listening, and they're all in that state in which they
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.880]   haven't a perfect balance and judgment, and they think it's marvelous.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.880]   They say they can't be convivial without drink, you see.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:34.400]   That means that while they're normal and controlled, they can't be convivial.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.160]   They have to be drugged before they can be released.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:44.280]   It robs us of balance and judgment.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.240]   And that is why some of us would be prepared to support an act of Parliament which says
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.640]   that any man who has taken even the slightest amount of alcohol should never be allowed
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.720]   to be in charge of a motor car.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:00.640]   The moment you take even the smallest amount in, it's affected your judgment.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:06.320]   You don't see things straightly, you've lost your balance.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:11.440]   Not only that, it robs us of inward peace.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:15.320]   The moment you sin, conscience begins to work and you're unhappy.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:19.360]   Oh, how unhappy Adam and Eve were the moment they'd sinned, and it's the same with all
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.360]   of us.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.320]   The moment we do it, it's marvelous before, and there was nothing but joy and happiness
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.320]   and a great thrill.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.960]   The moment there's a reaction and a revulsion and you're unhappy and you're filled with
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:35.360]   remorse, you've lost your peace.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.920]   And you lose your joy.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:42.360]   Oh, I needn't stay with these things, it's enough to mention them.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:47.640]   And indeed if you continue in it, you'll even lose your physical health.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:53.480]   But still more tragic and devastating about sin is this, that it robs us of our taste
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.840]   for good things.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.520]   People who live a life of sin see nothing in the Bible and in good books.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.800]   They don't appreciate the life of a saint.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.320]   The saint is a bore to them.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.560]   They've lost their appreciation of all that is good and noble and uplifting.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.480]   They even lose their taste for poetry and for music and all these things.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.960]   They must have this stimulus all along.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.000]   But I'll tell you something even more remarkable than that about sin, and it's suggested by
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.760]   this very picture.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:29.600]   The habitual and confirmed sinner not only loses his taste for good things, he even loses
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.280]   his taste for bad things.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.640]   Had you ever thought of that?
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.440]   He gets tired of it.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.600]   And that is why they have to change their sins.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:44.440]   I remember a poor man once whom I found was a drug taker.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.560]   And you know why that man had taken to drugs?
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.640]   Well this was his story and it was the simple truth.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:57.400]   He had drank so much that he, to use his own language, could no longer get any kick out
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.400]   of it.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.680]   He'd finished that as it were, so he had to take to drugs.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.200]   He got no pleasure any longer out of drinks, so he had to go to something else.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.120]   And you'll find they do that always.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.880]   You see they lose their taste not only for the good, but even for the bad.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.880]   It's this state of lifelessness.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.200]   They've been so stimulating themselves falsely in the way I've described to you, that they've
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:23.000]   been robbed of their vital energy and they need something more and more powerful.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:32.920]   As they go on and on, they lose even their taste for evil things and for bad things.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:40.120]   But I needn't keep you, I've got some poetry to quote to you, which gives you a more perfect
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:46.040]   picture than I can ever paint to you, of the way in which sin so robs us that in the end
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:50.880]   it leaves us just an empty husk of life with nothing at all.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:58.240]   I'm going to quote you two verses from the poet Byron.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:07.720]   Lord Byron, a man who had his fill of sin and of what this world can give.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:12.880]   A great poet, I admit, a genius, yes, but not a Christian.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.720]   A sinner, a man of the world, a transgressor.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.880]   Now let me tell you something that he wrote.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:28.320]   In 1824 he celebrated his 36th birthday.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.680]   36th.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.920]   And he wrote a poem of which the title is this.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:40.280]   In this day I complete my 36th year.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.640]   You'll know that's a comparatively young age, isn't it?
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.680]   36.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:50.280]   But here's a man who's been living the sinful, godless, worthly life most of those
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:54.320]   36 years, and this is what he says.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.840]   My days are in the yellow leaf.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.960]   He's only 36, remember?
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.360]   My days are in the yellow leaf.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:09.200]   The flowers and fruits of love are gone.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.680]   Oh, he'd had his fill of love.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.440]   He was the great lover.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.760]   The Don Joan, wasn't he?
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:22.480]   The marvelous lover, but at the age of 36 he says, the flowers and fruits of love are
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.480]   gone.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:32.800]   The worm, the canker, and the grief are mine alone.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.680]   What an appalling condition to be in at the age of 36.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.440]   But oh, of how many has it been true?
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:46.320]   The fire that on my bosom prays is lone as some volcanic isle.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:51.320]   No torch is kindled at its blaze.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:55.360]   A funeral pile.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:59.200]   Poor Byron.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:06.520]   He's been tormented to such a degree and to such a point at the age of 36.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:10.960]   His days are already at the yellow leaf.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.320]   The flowers and the fruits have gone.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:22.800]   The excitement and the thrill and the abandon and the joy have long since been forgotten.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:29.880]   Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat and they draw nigh unto the gates of death.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.360]   He's not only sick of sin, he's sick of life.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.360]   It's ended.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.360]   It's a funeral pile.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.360]   The husk is left.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.360]   The kernel is gone.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.360]   He's burnt out.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.360]   He's exhausted.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.360]   There's nothing left.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:45.680]   Sin has robbed him of everything and he can find no kick in life.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.920]   Nothing can stimulate him.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.760]   Love, even, the thing he lived for, is gone.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.640]   He's on the scrap heap of life.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:02.200]   Fools because of their transgressions and because of their iniquities afflict themselves.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:08.680]   Their souls abhor all manner of meats and they draw nigh unto the gates of death.
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:17.200]   Exhausted, lifeless, hopeless, tired of life, dying with nothing whatsoever, robbed and
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.200]   penniless.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:25.240]   That's what sin does.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:34.460]   It reduces us to refuse and throws us onto the scrap heaps.
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:38.840]   Don't you see that in all this, as I expand this psalm, I'm simply putting in my language
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.920]   and in biblical language what you can read in the newspapers whenever you like.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.920]   There it is.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.920]   It's all there.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:49.640]   You live that kind of life, that will be the result.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:56.440]   Very well, thank God that we've got a gospel, isn't it?
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:01.880]   Their souls abhor all manner of meat and they draw near unto the gates of death.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:09.880]   Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.600]   Is it possible?
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:18.840]   Is it possible that this person who is dying there, being eaten by the canker, losing all
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:23.400]   vitality and health and strength and power, is it possible that anything can be done?
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.360]   It is.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:34.600]   He sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:41.920]   Oh, that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.920]   children of men.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.920]   What's it mean?
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.760]   It's the old, old story of the gospel.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.120]   They cried out, "What did God do?"
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.400]   He sent his word and healed them.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.400]   What's the word?
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.480]   The word of the gospel.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.440]   The thing the Apostle Peter was talking about in that first chapter that I read to you at
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:05.000]   the beginning, this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you, the reconciling
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   word.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.640]   It's the thing that Christ does.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.140]   You remember he did it to that nobleman's son?
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.080]   He simply sent a word and it happened.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.240]   It's the same thing.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:20.580]   He is the word of God and he's come into the world in order to heal this fell disease.
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.120]   And how has he done it?
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:27.240]   May I again remind you of it as I close?
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:33.040]   He first of all deals with the infection or the growth, the canker, whatever it may be,
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.760]   and he takes it out of us.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.360]   He extirpates it.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.560]   He stops the disease process.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:46.940]   The first need of men is that the guilt of sin be removed, that the poison be taken out.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.560]   And he came from heaven to earth in order to do it.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:57.740]   If I may use such a phrase, he came to suck the poison of this fell disease out of us.
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:03.260]   And it meant his own death, but he died that you and I might be forgiven.
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:07.060]   He died that we might be reconciled to God.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:13.260]   And his word is the word of reconciliation, that God was in Christ reconciling the world
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:17.220]   unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.740]   But thank God he didn't stop at that.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.460]   Healing you know means much more than that.
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:27.020]   It means the restoration of health.
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:33.120]   He sent his word and healed them and Christ does it in this way.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:37.660]   This New Testament doctrine doesn't merely tell us that our sins are forgiven, it goes
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:41.460]   on to tell us that we are given new life.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:46.980]   Its doctrine is what it calls a doctrine of a rebirth and of a regeneration.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.180]   We can be born again.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:52.340]   He injects as it were new life into us.
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:53.860]   He gives us a new start.
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:58.340]   He rescues us from the very jaws of death and the grave and hell, and then he gives
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.220]   us life anew.
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.620]   We become new men.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:03.800]   He puts us upon our feet.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.220]   We have new vigour.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.660]   We have new powers.
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.000]   We have new tastes, new desires.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.620]   He fills us with a new kind of life and of existence altogether.
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:19.300]   That's how he heals.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.560]   He breaks the power of cancelled sin.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.000]   He sets the prisoner free.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.800]   He gives us that new life, that divine life.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.720]   He makes us partakers of the divine nature.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.300]   We are new creations.
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.640]   All things are passed away.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.680]   Behold, all things become new.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:41.400]   We are taken off the bed, out of the bedroom, put in the open air, given the task, given
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:46.480]   the power to perform.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:53.880]   And not only that, he fills us with an abundant and an abounding health and joy.
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.340]   Did you notice how this man puts it?
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:02.640]   He sent his word and healed them and delivered them out of their destruction.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:10.000]   Therefore, let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   rejoicing.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.440]   The Lord Jesus Christ doesn't merely tide you over the crisis and make you feel a little
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.360]   bit better on that sick bed.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.720]   Not at all.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.280]   He has dealt with the disease.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.360]   He gives you new life.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:33.400]   And it's so marvelous and so thrilling that whereas you were hopeless and like Byron,
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:40.040]   with your life at its yellow leaf and the exhaustion, you're the exact opposite.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:47.440]   "I have come," says the Lord Jesus Christ, "that they might have life."
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.240]   But he didn't stop there, you know.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:57.560]   "I have come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly."
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:03.400]   A superabundance of life and of health, of vigor and of power, joy and rejoicing where
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:07.640]   there was formerly misery and wretchedness.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:13.080]   Beauty for ashes, the spirit of rejoicing in place of heaviness.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:20.240]   A real health, a vigorous personality, not a mere weakling shuffling through life, but
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:28.760]   one who is filled with the power of the Spirit and rejoicing as he goes on living in Christ
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.760]   Jesus.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.080]   That's the message.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:44.480]   My friend, my friend, how are you?
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.480]   What do you feel like?
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:51.960]   Are you on your feet in life or are you lying on that sick bed?
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.960]   Are you tired?
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.160]   Are you weary spiritually?
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.640]   Are you exhausted?
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.080]   Have you lost interest in life?
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:06.280]   Have you sometimes said to yourself, "Wish I were dead."
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.760]   How many say that today, "Wish I were dead.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.120]   Wish I could get out of it."
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.460]   Have you lost interest?
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.280]   Have you lost vitality?
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.980]   Have you lost pleasure?
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:17.980]   Have you lost everything?
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:27.200]   Are you merely existing, slowly dying, your vitality being eaten out as by a cancer within
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.160]   you?
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:37.240]   If you are, and if you've got tired of trying to rouse yourself and to heal yourself,
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:42.740]   and if you've given up turning to the world and its methods, it's my privilege to tell
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:46.480]   you this in utter simplicity.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.120]   Cry out unto the Lord.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.680]   He's the only one who can deal with you.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.340]   I don't care what your circumstances are.
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:57.000]   You can tell me about your problems and your difficulties.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   I don't care.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.480]   I don't care what they are.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:06.080]   When He replies, He delivers.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.280]   He will heal you.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.200]   He'll reconcile you unto Himself.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.960]   He'll let you know that He's done it.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.640]   You'll know that your sins are forgiven, and you'll be amazed at yourself.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:16.640]   You'll have a new life.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.240]   You'll be a new person.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:22.880]   You'll have new interests, new joys, and you won't understand yourself.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:28.720]   It's because He will have given you this gift of life, of health, of wholeness, of
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.160]   mastery.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:38.360]   And He'll sustain you and feed you and help you to live according to His laws and principles
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:46.400]   of spiritual health while you remain in this world and afterwards receive you unto Himself
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:54.120]   and usher you into the endless glory.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:52:00.680]   It grieves me to think that there is even the possibility of anybody going out of this
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:07.840]   service feeling unhappy still, feeling miserable, feeling lifeless, and feeling defeated.
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:17.160]   My dear friend, like all these people, cry out unto the Lord in your trouble, and He
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.800]   will deliver you out of your distresses.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.880]   Acknowledge and confess that you are as you are because of your own sin.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.600]   Repent, acknowledge it, confess it.
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:35.280]   Don't plead anything, but admit it all, and then believe Him when He tells you that
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:42.240]   He sent His Son to die for you and for your sins and that He will give you life anew.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:49.720]   Repent, believe, and you will prove it to be true.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.200]   Amen.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
