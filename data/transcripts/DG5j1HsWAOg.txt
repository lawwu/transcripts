[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - We talked a little bit about era of time last time,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   but in many worlds that there is a kind of
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.160]   implied era of time, right?
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.760]   So you've talked about the era of time
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.800]   that has to do with the second law of thermodynamics.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.040]   That's the era of time that's emergent or fundamental.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.440]   We don't know, I guess.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.440]   - No, it's emergent.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.760]   - Does everyone agree on that?
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.120]   Well, nobody agrees with everything.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.520]   - They should. - They should.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.040]   (laughing)
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.760]   So that era of time, is that different
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.700]   than the era of time that's implied by many worlds?
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.160]   - It's not different, actually, no.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.960]   In both cases, you have fundamental laws of physics
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.640]   that are completely reversible.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.480]   If you give me the state of the universe
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.600]   at one moment in time, I can run the clock
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.040]   forward or backward equally well.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.200]   There's no arrow of time built into the laws of physics
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.980]   at the most fundamental level.
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.000]   But what we do have are special initial conditions
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.640]   14 billion years ago near the Big Bang.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.320]   In thermodynamics, those special initial conditions
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.240]   take the form of things were low entropy,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.360]   and entropy has been increasing ever since,
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.400]   making the universe more disorganized and chaotic,
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.300]   and that's the era of time.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.980]   In quantum mechanics, these special initial conditions
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.800]   take the form of there was only one branch
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.320]   of the wave function, and the universe
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.520]   has been branching more and more ever since.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.940]   - Okay, so if time is emergent,
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.040]   so it seems like our human cognitive capacity
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.760]   likes to take things that are emergent
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.100]   and feel like they're fundamental.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.360]   So if time is emergent, and locality,
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.400]   like is space emergent?
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.240]   - Yes.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.060]   - Okay.
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.900]   - But I didn't say time was emergent,
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.560]   I said the arrow of time was emergent.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.840]   Those are different.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.360]   What's the difference between the arrow of time and time?
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.880]   Are you using arrow of time to simply mean
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.840]   they're synonymous with the second law of thermodynamics?
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.840]   - No, but the arrow of time is the difference
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.240]   between the past and future.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.280]   So there's space, but there's no arrow of space.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.640]   You don't feel that space has to have an arrow, right?
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.800]   You could live in thermodynamic equilibrium,
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.360]   there'd be no arrow of time, but there'd still be time.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.800]   There'd still be a difference between now
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.320]   and the future or whatever.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.640]   - Ah, so, okay.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.760]   So if nothing changes, there's still time.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.960]   - Well, things could even change.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.400]   Like if the whole universe consisted of the Earth
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.760]   going around the sun, okay?
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.400]   It would just go in circles or ellipses, right?
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.240]   - That's an equilibrium.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.480]   - Things would change, but it's not increasing entropy.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.360]   There's no arrow.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.760]   If you took a movie of that,
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.720]   and I played you the movie backward, you would never know.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.160]   - So the arrow of time can theoretically point
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.400]   in the other direction for brief, briefly.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.920]   - To the extent that it points in different directions,
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.000]   it's not a very good arrow.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.880]   I mean, the arrow of time in the macroscopic world
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.760]   is so powerful that there's just no chance of going back.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.320]   When you get down to tiny systems
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.880]   with only three or four moving parts,
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.840]   then entropy can fluctuate up and down.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:32.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
