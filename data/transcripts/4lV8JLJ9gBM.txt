[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.400]   - We have an email today all the way from Middle Earth.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.400]   Hello, Pastor John, my name is Simon from New Zealand.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.000]   I've been thinking a lot about copyright
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.480]   and often wondered how copyright fits with scripture.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.360]   I'm a video content creator
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.400]   and sometimes the copyright laws matter deeply to me,
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.320]   other times not so much.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.840]   How should believers view intellectual property rights?
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.360]   What would you say to Simon?
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.200]   - Let's start by laying down a few biblical precepts
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.340]   which are perhaps taken for granted by everyone.
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.240]   But in our day, historical forgetfulness
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.760]   and widespread expectation of unmerited entitlement
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.160]   and pervasive individual autonomy
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.280]   with the individual self as the supreme value
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.600]   and the supreme arbiter in the world
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.920]   with all of that reality around me,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.920]   perhaps what I'm about to say cannot be taken for granted
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.160]   or for being obvious, but here they are.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.960]   Here are the precepts that lay the foundation
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.960]   for I think the understanding
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.940]   of intellectual property rights.
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.460]   Namely first, God has ordained in this present world
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.520]   that stealing is wrong.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.520]   Ephesians 4:28, "Let the thief no longer steal,"
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.280]   or Romans 13, nine, "You shall not steal."
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.920]   Now those are New Testament precepts,
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.340]   not just Old Testament legal statutes.
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.560]   And the assumption is that this is the way
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.520]   born again people will be led by the Holy Spirit
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.400]   freely and joyfully to act.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.560]   And it's the way that at the level of behavior,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.400]   God commands the world to live.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.880]   It also seems to many of us who reflect on it
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.040]   that this command not to steal implies
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.920]   so there must be some right that a person has
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.760]   to keep or possess or use as he sees fit
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.080]   the property that he owns.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.000]   We call this private property.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.660]   May not be the best term, but I think we know what I mean.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.660]   The command not to steal assumes the rightness
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.480]   of personal ownership.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.600]   There's another phrase for it maybe,
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.720]   which implies the right to trade what I have
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.600]   or sell what I have so that I could make a living.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.320]   If I could get some appropriate or just or fair value
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.460]   from another person for what I have just created.
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.560]   That's the first precept, don't steal,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.760]   and the right of personal ownership
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.440]   and selling and trading.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.440]   Second, Colossians 3.9, do not lie to one another
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.700]   seeing that you have put off the old self
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.580]   with his practices.
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.240]   So what God expects from Israel once upon a time
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.740]   and from the church today is that we are new people
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.180]   in Christ and these new people in Christ
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.420]   do not lie to one another.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.660]   We have put off in putting on the new man, Jesus Christ,
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.980]   we've put off lying and that same behavior
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.780]   is normative for the world at the level of behavior.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.100]   Not lying, telling the truth, which would imply
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.660]   that if you say that something is yours,
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.340]   when it's not yours, you have sinned against God
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.060]   as well as your fellow man.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.460]   So if a student, say in my class,
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.900]   says that a paragraph in his essay is his
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.460]   when he has copied it straight out of Wikipedia
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.660]   without giving any credit, the teacher, John Piper,
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.460]   will say, "You're lying."
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.500]   And he'll say, "No, no, no, no, I really believe
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.420]   "what's in this paragraph.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.520]   "It's really my idea.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.180]   "I agree with it, it's mine."
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.760]   And I would say, "No, by copying it verbatim
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.340]   "from Wikipedia and giving no credit,
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.400]   "you have taken over not just an idea
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.240]   "but a way of saying it that belongs to somebody else
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.520]   "and you're not telling the truth.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.200]   "You're a plagiarist and you're gonna get a lower grade
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.400]   "because of it, maybe even not pass."
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   Third, and I think it's very relevant
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.240]   to intellectual property issues,
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.640]   Ephesians chapter four, verse 28,
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.560]   same one we referred to earlier.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.560]   Paul goes on to tell that thief who should no longer steal,
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.160]   "Let him labor, doing honest work with his hands
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.380]   "so that he may have something," that's important,
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.660]   "to share with anyone in need."
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.740]   So there are at least these three important things
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.680]   in that verse.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.940]   One, doing honest work that produces some kind of value,
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.460]   might be a product, might be a service.
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.800]   Second, he should be compensated for it
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.280]   so that he has something,
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.600]   that's how he's making his living now,
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   he's not stealing, he's making things or doing things
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.680]   or producing things or performing things
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.160]   so that people say, "That's valuable,
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.140]   "I'll give you $15 an hour for doing that
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.280]   "or I'll pay you $14 for that shirt you just made."
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   And third, he should be inclined in freedom and love
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.960]   to use his resources to help others
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.000]   who may not have his advantages.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.200]   So the precept of the goodness of work
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.380]   and the rightness of making a profit or earning a living
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.080]   and the goodness of sharing what we earn with others
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.800]   and the goodness of having it to share
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.340]   so that it's free and not coerced,
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.100]   all of that seems to be implied in verse 28 of chapter four.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.580]   So I would say that all three of these larger precepts,
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.480]   not stealing with the implication of the rights
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.840]   of personal ownership or private property,
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.760]   number two, not lying and thus claiming something
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.840]   to be yours that's not yours,
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.160]   and three, gainful employment which is justly compensated
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.040]   so that we can possess things
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.900]   and then have things to share with others freely,
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.120]   I think that all of that underpins
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.120]   contemporary understandings of intellectual property rights.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.040]   They flow, these rights flow from these principles
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.640]   and I know that it is possible, I've read some,
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.400]   to approach intellectual property rights
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.920]   from a very different perspective
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.280]   and justify them on the basis of selfishness
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.440]   and hoarding and the desire to be rich
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.440]   and the need to give incentives to people
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.920]   to maximize their wealth by coming up with inventions
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.080]   and other things, but this would not be the first time,
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.760]   would it, when bad motives and good motives
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.360]   lead to the same laws?
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.380]   I can think of lots of illustrations of that in life,
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.680]   but Christians aren't to be motivated by bad motives
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.800]   even if they come up with the same laws
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.940]   that people with bad motives come up with.
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.520]   So intellectual property rights include things like patents
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.320]   for inventions of material things
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.960]   and there's a fuzzy line between material things
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.160]   and other kinds of copyrights and industrial design rights
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.240]   and I mean, there's all kinds of stuff.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.200]   So patents is one, copyrights for the verbal creations,
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.360]   which doesn't mean that you have mere information
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.520]   or an idea that you own,
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   but rather your form of expression of it is owned.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.720]   Trademarks are another example,
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.600]   like you design something and it signifies,
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.140]   oh, that's the Pillsbury or the 3M or the Apple
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.940]   or the Microsoft trademark
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.160]   and you can't start using that for your own company
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   without legal entanglements
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.820]   and I'm saying that these rights are rooted
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.020]   in those biblical principles.
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:12.520]   So those are three examples of property rights
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.840]   and there's lots of others or intellectual property rights
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.120]   and the essence of the matter seems to be
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.120]   that just like a person can build a car or a bicycle
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.280]   or make a shirt and sell it in order to make a living,
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.560]   so a person can invent a certain wiring circuitry
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.200]   that can be used in every phone on the planet
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.120]   that has never been thought of before
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.420]   and make a living by owning that patent
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.200]   for at least a season in history.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.800]   Similarly, a person can write a poem or a novel or song
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.760]   or make a video or a short story or an essay,
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.040]   could sell it in a store or sell it to a newspaper
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.360]   and make his living that way
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.720]   and copyright laws exist to protect
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.540]   that way of making a living
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.660]   and so it seems right to me that Simon in New Zealand
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.020]   should care about copyright laws
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.660]   and should not consider it sinful to be thankful
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.560]   for their protection of his work
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.920]   so that he can make a living.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.600]   This is not about boasting, this is not about arrogance,
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.320]   this is not about selfishness,
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.880]   this is about protecting a way of making a living
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.520]   the way selling a shirt would be.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.920]   And the only other thing I would add is that Christians,
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.180]   Christians are not simply shrewd business people.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.200]   Our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.440]   We do not exist to lay up treasures on earth.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.260]   We want to draw attention to the supreme value of God
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:54.260]   over all material things including the ones we create
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.260]   and so Christians will be lavishly generous
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:04.900]   with the things we create and the money we make from them.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.180]   It will not be wrong to take the things we create
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.980]   and make a living with them
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.820]   but we will seek in every way we can
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.420]   to be generous with those in need
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.380]   and especially to spread the good news of the gospel
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.700]   making it as free as we can.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.060]   - Yeah, amen, we love to create content
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.680]   and to spread it online free of charge to the world
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.820]   and I would encourage you to get familiar
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.620]   with all of the content that we have online
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.300]   at desiringgod.org and be sure to check out
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.820]   Look at the Book, it's a series of videos
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.140]   where John Piper marks up biblical passages with a pen
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.560]   to show you how he dissects those passages
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.220]   in order to extract principles of truth.
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.140]   You'll want to check those out.
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.700]   They're deeply valuable resources free online
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.460]   and you can also find many thousands of articles,
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.820]   sermons, free books, lots of free books.
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.220]   You can find all of that at desiringgod.org
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.180]   and we close out the week
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.060]   with a very important question tomorrow.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.060]   If I read the Bible and I feel nothing happening in my heart,
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.700]   nothing in my affections, what do I do next?
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.660]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.360]   We'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.040]   (whooshing)
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.200]   (silence)
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.360]   (silence)
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.420]   you
