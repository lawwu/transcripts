[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   On days like today, I really do feel sorry for the public, for you guys essentially trying to keep up with AI news and the kind of questions you might have.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.120]   Did OpenAI just automate my job with Operator?
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.280]   Who knows, you're probably thinking, it's $200 and it's really hard to get past those clickbait headlines.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.240]   Did the US government just invest half a trillion dollars into a Stargate? What the hell is that?
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.600]   I heard China just caught up to the West in AI with something called DeepSeek and why are people talking about Humanity's last exam?
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:41.200]   So to try to help a little bit, I'm going to cover the 9 developments of the last 100 hours, honestly, if not exhaustively.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:50.600]   Yes, of course, I read the DeepSeek paper in full and have spent hours testing the OpenAI Operator, as well as the Perplexity Assistant and all the rest.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.080]   In case you're wondering, yes, I did edit this Perplexity response.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.880]   First up in this listicle video is, of course, OpenAI's Operator and it's kind of decent, it's okay.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.480]   You have to use a VPN if you're not in the US and honestly, I wouldn't do that for the functionality.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.080]   I would do it if you want to kind of get a sense of where agents are going.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.680]   Just straight up front, though, I can tell you that it's nowhere close to automating any kind of job for two major reasons.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.200]   One is it often gets stuck in these kind of loops where it attempts the same kind of basic failed plan again and again.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.080]   It's not essentially smart enough to get itself out of these kind of basic loops.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.480]   The second big reason is because of OpenAI's own impositions on what the model can't do, understandable impositions.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.880]   I tried about 20 random tasks and the truth is you can never fully relax.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.200]   You always have to keep going back to the system and saying, yes, proceed.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   And no, you can't manually hard override that.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.800]   You can't put it in the prompt not to ask permission.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.200]   Then, of course, many sites have captures that you have to manually take over and input.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.480]   I'm pretty certain if you iterate again and again on a prompt,
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.200]   you can develop a workflow that you could save on the top right and share and maybe save a little bit of time for certain tasks.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.600]   At the moment, though, if I'm being honest, it is a bit of a stretch to say that it's useful.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.080]   But if we step back, you can see where all of this is going.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.240]   This operator has a ton of safeguards that might slow it down,
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.800]   but people will just migrate to ones that don't have those safeguards.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.720]   Ones where downloading files is easier and captures are done for you.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.200]   That'll be great for usability, but not so great for the dead Internet theory.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.720]   Then there's just flat out mistakes.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.160]   I read the system card in full for OpenAI's operator and it was quite revealing.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.040]   The operator is known to make "irreversible mistakes" like sending an email to the wrong recipient
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.240]   or having an incorrectly dated reminder for the user to take their medication.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.760]   And yes, they did reduce those mistakes, but not eliminate them.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.520]   Also, when I talked about those confirmations that the model asked before proceeding to the next step,
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.400]   that happens most times, but not every time.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.000]   Sometimes the operator just goes ahead and does it, which is a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your perspective.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.280]   You'll be quite glad, I guess, to know that when it's asked to do things like make banking transactions,
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.680]   it refuses at a rate of around 94%.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.640]   Then you might be wondering, what about if the operator navigates to a malicious site that's trying to trick the operator?
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.400]   Well, there was one time where it did so and didn't notice that it was doing so.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.800]   OpenAI are aware of this, though, and have an extra layer of safety on top called a prompt injection monitor,
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.320]   checking to see if sites are trying to trick the operator.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.520]   And it did catch this concerning example, but there's one problem.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.360]   It, too, fails around 1% of the time.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.120]   They, of course, commit to rapidly updating it in response to newly discovered attacks.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.360]   But there is a slim chance things could go wrong at every layer.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:02.040]   In my last video, if you remember, I gave you early leaked results on its performance in various computer use benchmarks and web browsing benchmarks.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.520]   But remember, it uses chain of thought to think through what it should do at each stage.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.680]   It monitors the screen, taking screenshots, and then decides.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.320]   Now, whenever you hear chain of thought, think rapid improvement in the near future.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:23.360]   If we get a widely accessible or open source agent this year, say from China, that gets 80%, 90% on computer use benchmarks like this one,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.680]   then the internet is going to change forever.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.560]   Fun fact, by the way, the system prompt lies to the model and encourages the model to lie.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.080]   It tells the model it has 20 years of experience in using a computer.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.160]   And it says, if you recognize someone while using the computer, say browsing an image, you should not identify them.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.760]   Just say you don't know even if you do know that person.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.000]   Personally, can't see any problem with encouraging models to lie.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.320]   But anyway, we have to get to the next story.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.560]   The story is a quick one, which is the announcement yesterday of the perplexity assistant for Android.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.880]   I immediately downloaded and tried it out.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:05.240]   Obviously, it's much smarter than something like Siri, and I've been using it to play very particular songs or specific YouTube videos.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.640]   But there's a slight problem.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.840]   At the moment, it's not quite smart enough.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.040]   It doesn't understand commands like play me the latest video from the YouTube channel AI Explained.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:22.800]   Now, for a story that many people think is bigger than agents, as big as it gets, half a trillion dollars into Project Stargate.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.200]   Except it's kind of not really half a trillion dollars.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.640]   It's definitely a hundred billion dollars, which was kind of reported on a while back.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.920]   I even did a video on it.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.920]   And the rest is all promises.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.240]   Mind you, a hundred billion dollars is still a hell of a lot of money.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.000]   And that will get you a lot of big, beautiful buildings in someone's words or massive data centers.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.200]   You don't build that, in other words, unless you think AI is going to radically transform society.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:55.640]   By promised size of investment, we're talking about something on the scale of the Manhattan Project as a fraction of GDP.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.480]   The analogy, of course, of building a nuclear bomb is appropriate, at least in terms of its ambiguity.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.680]   Because even though Project Stargate, according to the U.S. president, is going to be, quote, great for jobs.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.680]   And according to Sam Altman, incredible for the country.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:18.080]   Let's not pretend that for many of the companies investing in this project, one of the first things they would do with an AGI is cut down on labor costs.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.360]   Sam Altman has himself directly predicted as much many, many times over the years, including fairly recently.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.120]   He said things like the cost of labor will go to zero and he expects massive inequality.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:40.880]   Now, obviously, the boost to shareholder value will be amazing and there will be other upsides, according to Larry Ellison, one of the key investors in Project Stargate.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.720]   And what's that, you ask? Well, AI surveillance.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:52.160]   The police will be on their best behavior because we're constantly recording, watching and recording everything that's going on.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:00.360]   Citizens will be on their best behavior because we're constantly recording and reporting everything that's going on.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.800]   And it's it's unimpeachable.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.920]   I'm not the only one, by the way, who is a little bit concerned about the downsides of that kind of surveillance.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.640]   This was Anthropic CEO Dario Amadei's reaction to the news of Stargate.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.680]   At the end of this Bloomberg article, he said, I'm very worried about 1984 scenarios or worse.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.840]   If I were a predicting man, I would say that that would first come to a place like China and only later to the West.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:37.120]   But that's cold comfort. Basically, to spell it out, imagine every text message and email being monitored by a massive AGI LLM for signs of subversion.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.600]   Of course, there are doubters of Stargate, including, curiously, Microsoft, who weren't there at the announcement.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.960]   Apparently their executives have been studying whether building such large data centers for open AI would even pay off in the long run.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:57.520]   Speaking of Anthropic, the next story is a quick one because it's just a rumor, but it's from a pretty reliable source.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.920]   Dilip Patel of Semianalysis says that Anthropic have a model that is better than O3.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:10.520]   If you're not sure what O3 is, I've done a video on it, but it's a model that broke various benchmarks in mathematics and coding
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.120]   and is the smartest model that's known currently, although it's not publicly released yet.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.720]   Google's already got a reasoning model, Anthropic allegedly has one internally that's like really good, better than O3 even,
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.080]   but, you know, we'll see when they eventually release it, like it's like.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:32.600]   Now, though, for the story that many of you have been waiting for, which is DeepSeek R1, the model out of China that shocked many in the West.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.960]   DeepSeek, for those who don't know, is kind of a side project of a Chinese quant trading firm.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:44.280]   And yet they've produced a model that's more or less as good as the best that AGI Labs in the West have come up with.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.880]   It's not quite as good, in my opinion, but it is massively cheaper to use.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.240]   And no one, I don't think, was expecting them to catch up as quickly as they have done.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:09:01.120]   And to give you more of a sense of context, the likely budget for the entire DeepSeek R1 model and the entire DeepSeek team
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:09.320]   is likely less than the annual salary of certain CEOs of AGI Labs in the West whose models underperform DeepSeek R1.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:16.160]   At least according to the benchmark figures, which you've got to admit look pretty tall and impressive.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.400]   And by the way, I don't think these numbers are faked.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.360]   If this model had been released 100 days ago, it would definitely have counted as the best model in the world.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:31.360]   And I don't rule out the possibility that DeepSeek comes out with a model that's better than any other model around this year,
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.560]   especially in domains like mathematics and on certain science benchmarks.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.280]   Not likely, but possible.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:44.280]   If you're wondering, by the way, it got 30.9% on my own benchmark, a test of basic reasoning capacity.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.800]   That again would have been the best in the world just a few months ago.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.880]   Now, I am going to get to the detail of how it's made in a moment, but first some wider comments on what it means.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.040]   First, people keep calling it open source, but it's not fully open source.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.720]   They didn't release the data set behind the model.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:09.160]   They did say that DeepSeek R1 was using the base model DeepSeek V3, which was trained on around 15 trillion tokens,
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.160]   but they don't say what those tokens were.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.480]   In other words, we don't really know about the training data, so it's not fully open source.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:21.240]   Back to DeepSeek R1 though, and you might be wondering, didn't the US impose sanctions on China
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.960]   so they couldn't use advanced chips like the B100, for example, from Nvidia?
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:33.080]   Yes, they did, but that might have had the unintended side effect of forcing Chinese AI companies to be more innovative with what they've got.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:40.840]   In other words, there is a chance that those chip sanctions actually have brought China to being competitive with the West in AI.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:47.240]   The next comment is on the sheer acceleration this will unleash because it is mostly open sourced.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.960]   Anyone, including rival companies like Meta, can copy what DeepSeek have done.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:59.880]   Indeed, according to one possible leak, R1 massively outperforms Alarm 4, which isn't yet released from Meta,
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.640]   and so they're just dropping everything and copying what DeepSeek have done.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.440]   Of course, this is unconfirmed, but the principle is still the same.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.240]   It's almost like DeepSeek R1 is now the minimum performance because anyone can just copy it.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.000]   That's of course bad news and good news for safety, depending on how you look at it.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.440]   On the one hand, governance and control of AI look set to be borderline hopeless.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.600]   One very respected figure, formerly of Google DeepMind and OpenAI,
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.760]   said when asked what is the plan after DeepSeek for AGI safety, he said there is no plan.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:36.120]   But on the other hand, some have welcomed the fact that safety researchers can now inspect
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:42.200]   the chains of thought behind DeepSeek R1 in a way they couldn't have done with O1 or O3.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.800]   That's of course great for safety testers like Apollo Research,
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.680]   whom I interviewed three of them just a couple of days ago for AI Insiders on my Patreon.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.480]   And if you're wondering why studying R1 might be important,
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.680]   it's because the model emits chains of thought before answering,
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.920]   like the O-series of models from OpenAI.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.880]   We can only see summaries of those thoughts for the O-series, but with R1 we see everything.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.720]   So we can better study when the models might be scheming, which is what we covered in this interview.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:15.320]   All of which gets us to how DeepSeek R1 was trained in the first place.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.200]   And summarizing this 22-page paper full of research is going to be difficult,
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.920]   but I'm going to try and do it in one or two paragraphs.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.720]   Of course, this will be oversimplifying, but here we go.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:31.000]   So start with the base model, DeepSeek V3, which they had already made.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.320]   Then let's kick things off with some lovely,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.840]   long chain of thought examples to give the model a cold start.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.760]   Now you can skip that stage and go straight to reinforcement learning,
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.280]   but they found the training to be a bit unstable, unpredictable.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.640]   Anyway, having fine-tuned the base model on that cold start data,
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.360]   it's time to move to the next stage, reinforcement learning.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:56.360]   We're going to test the model repeatedly in verifiable domains like mathematics and code,
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.240]   rewarding it whenever it gets a correct outcome.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.640]   Not correct individual steps, and we'll get to that later, but the correct outcome.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.240]   Also, we need to throw in some fine-tuning on correct outputs
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.120]   that follow the right format in the appropriate language.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.520]   The format being always thinking first in tags, and then answering afterwards.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:20.920]   Then rinse and repeat this RL and fine-tuning, this time with some "non-reasoning data".
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:26.040]   Let's bring in some wider domains like factuality and "self-cognition".
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.560]   All of these correct outputs and fine-tuning data that we're gathering, by the way,
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.240]   can of course be used for distilling smaller, smarter models.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.600]   Anyway, Bob's your uncle, do all of that, and you get DeepSeq R1.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.440]   Of course, I'm skipping lots, if it were that easy then every company would have done it,
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.200]   but that's the basic idea.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.560]   And did you notice how synthetic that process is?
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.040]   Get the model to generate chains of thought,
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.200]   and then reinforce the model on those outputs that led to a correct answer.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.160]   They did not mandate reflective reasoning,
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.120]   or promote particular problem-solving strategies.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.800]   They wanted to accurately observe the model's natural progression during the RL process.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.720]   It's the bitter lesson in action, don't hard-code human rules,
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.120]   let the models discover them for themselves.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.240]   One of the things that the model teaches itself, by the way,
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.000]   is to output longer and longer responses to get better results.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.960]   Notice the average length of response going up and up and up the more it's trained.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.800]   Kind of makes sense, to solve harder problems you need longer outputs.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.400]   The models themselves learned that they needed to self-correct,
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.360]   that's not something inputted by researchers.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.920]   So that's why the model constantly does things like say,
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.880]   "Wait, wait, wait" in the middle of responses, and then change its mind.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.720]   Now what humans have learned is how to "jailbreak" the model,
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.040]   or get it to do whatever you want it to do.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.960]   And if that piques your interest, I've got an arena for you.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.400]   That's the Gray Swan Arena, which you can enter yourself,
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.800]   and they are the sponsors of today's video.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.080]   It's all about testing whether you can jailbreak these models,
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.920]   including the very latest ones.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.920]   By the way, you don't have to be an AI researcher,
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.240]   you could just be a creative writer or hacker,
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.160]   and there are monetary rewards.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.560]   Sometimes you're even testing models that aren't out yet,
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.520]   and there is one competition that is live as of today.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.960]   Pretty much every unreleased model can be jailbroken,
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.000]   and there are also leaderboards for those who do it best.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.760]   As ever, links in the description.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.400]   The next story is of great interest to me personally,
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.520]   because it pertains to the type of verifier they use.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:29.400]   This part of the paper updated my belief about how even O3 is trained.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.520]   To get the insane results in mathematics that O3 did,
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.040]   I thought every single reasoning step had to be verified.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.240]   Otherwise, just one miscalculation in an entire chain of thought
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.600]   could undo all the good work.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.920]   That's called process reward modeling,
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.680]   and that could still be how O1 and O3 are trained,
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.720]   but probably not.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.360]   Instead, it looks more likely now that it's simple outcome reward modeling.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.920]   That's the approach that underperformed in the original
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.680]   "let's verify step-by-step" paper.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.200]   I should say, many famous researchers, including Francois Chalet,
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.520]   still believe that the O series performs a kind of search every step,
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.280]   or a verification step.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.200]   But the DeepSeq team said that step-by-step verification
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.760]   adds additional computational overhead.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.800]   It's also susceptible, apparently, to reward hacking,
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.440]   where the base model just gets good at convincing the verifier that it's passed.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.360]   In short, it seems simpler just to grade the final answer,
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.280]   not every single reasoning step.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.920]   And here's another hint that it's a purer form of RL than I initially suspected,
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.200]   this time from Sébastien Boubec of OpenAI Now.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.160]   It's really, everything is kind of emergent.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.520]   Nothing is hard-coded.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.280]   It's anything that you see, you know, out there with the reasoning,
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.360]   nothing has been done to say to the model,
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.560]   "hey, you should maybe, you know, verify your solution.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.960]   You should backtrack, you should X, Y, Z."
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.840]   No tactic was given to the model.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.280]   Everything is emergent.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.320]   Everything is learned through reinforcement learning.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.960]   This is insane, insanity.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.240]   At this point in the video,
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.200]   I want to point out a kind of whitewashing done by OpenAI
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.280]   that I don't think anyone else has noticed.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.360]   The O series has been celebrated by OpenAI for its robustness,
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.080]   for example, just two days ago in this paper.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.840]   Great news for safety, apparently,
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.320]   that the model can think for longer before replying.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.880]   But I'm, of course, old enough to remember
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.680]   when it was supposed to be process reward modeling that was good for safety.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:29.080]   When OpenAI boasted that rewarding the thought process itself
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.400]   rather than the outcome is an encouraging sign for alignment.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.440]   This was echoed by Sam Altman because it was thought
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.480]   that we could review each step in the process
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.720]   rather than just look at the overall outcome.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.200]   If we just rewarded the outcome, which it seems like we are now doing,
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.000]   then the models would get up to all sorts of shenanigans
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   on the way toward getting the outcome.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.480]   Instead, if process supervision worked best,
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.600]   where we could scrutinize and optimize each individual step,
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.480]   we'd have better scrutiny of the overall process.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.160]   My question is, if optimizing each individual step
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.600]   in process supervision is a positive sign for alignment,
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.640]   what does it say now that we're rewarding outcomes?
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.320]   Shouldn't there be a new blog post saying that outcome-based supervision
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.480]   has an important alignment downside?
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.360]   No, it seems like we only get the blog post if it seems good.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.920]   Give up on your dreams of producing a chain of thought that is endorsed by humans.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.320]   This is the kind of chain of thought summary
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.520]   that I get for an English language request.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.280]   A chain of thought in Spanish, which makes it a bit harder for me to endorse.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.320]   I've also seen many chains of thought, of course, in Mandarin.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.160]   This kind of language mixing, by the way,
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.760]   was, of course, foreseen by people like Andrea Karpathy, who said,
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.920]   "You can tell that reinforcement learning is done properly
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.800]   when the models cease to speak English in their chain of thought."
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.840]   Why would English, or indeed ultimately any human language,
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.200]   be the optimum way to do step-by-step reasoning?
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.720]   What happens if a model proposes a solution to climate change
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.920]   and we inspect their chain of thought and it's just random characters?
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.160]   It's a bit harder to trust what's going on.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.480]   Indeed, Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind,
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.560]   in an interview published yesterday, warned that he worried that models
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:13.080]   will become "deceptive" and "underperform" on tests of their malicious capability.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.680]   Pretend, in other words, not to be able to produce a bioweapon.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.400]   Also, I had noticed Demis Hassabis changed his timelines in recent months,
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.320]   saying that he expected AGI, or superintelligence, within a decade.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.240]   If you guys have been following my channel,
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.040]   you'll know that he gave deadlines like 2034.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.320]   Well, check this out.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.000]   And I think one thing that's clearly missing,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.480]   and I always, always had as a benchmark for AGI,
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.960]   was the ability for these systems to invent their own hypotheses
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.080]   or conjectures about science, not just prove existing ones.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.760]   So, of course, that's extremely useful already,
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.800]   to prove an existing maths conjecture or something like that,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.600]   or play a game of Go to a world champion level.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.680]   But could a system invent Go?
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.240]   Could it come up with a new Riemann hypothesis?
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.800]   Or could it come up with relativity back in the days that Einstein did it,
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.240]   with the information that he had?
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.360]   And I think today's systems are still pretty far away
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.200]   from having that kind of creative, inventive capability.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.520]   Okay, so a couple of years away till we hit AGI.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.440]   I think, you know, I would say probably like three to five years away.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.880]   So if someone were to declare that they've reached AGI in 2025,
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.680]   probably marketing.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.280]   I think so.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.440]   Almost every AI CEO, in other words,
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.280]   seems to be converging on this one to five year timeline.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.240]   Why not this year?
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.920]   Well, let me try to give you a strange anecdotal example.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.400]   Models like DeepSeek R1 have weird, quirky reasoning flaws.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.360]   For the purposes of testing this coding side project that I'm doing,
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.560]   I asked DeepSeek R1 to come up with this multiple choice quiz.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.880]   It had to meet certain parameters and it failed to meet them,
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.160]   but that wasn't the real issue.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.200]   You notice a slight flaw with the multiple choice answers
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.120]   it produced for these 25 questions.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.600]   Let's just say that they are somewhat biased towards answers B and C.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.120]   Here's my bigger question though.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.400]   Will these remaining reasoning blind spots, you could call them,
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.120]   be filled as a by-product of continued scaling of, say, RL?
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.840]   Or will they need to be patched one by one?
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.680]   If the former is the case,
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.720]   we could have AGI in those very short timelines
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.520]   that the AI CEOs publicly predict now.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.520]   If the latter scenario is the case,
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.360]   that they have to be patched one by one,
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.120]   there could be AGI denialists in 2030 and beyond.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.880]   Where better to end the video then,
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.680]   than on "Humanity's Last Exam".
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.320]   I don't regard this as a test for AGI,
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.240]   but it is an interesting new benchmark.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.120]   I would say the title is a little bit misleading
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.880]   because the creators of the benchmark
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.440]   are working on another challenging benchmark,
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.760]   which apparently takes groups of humans days to complete,
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.880]   so is even harder.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.880]   Some people have focused on the fact that DeepSeek R1 performs best,
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.880]   getting 9.4% on this hardest of the hard benchmarks.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.600]   The truth is, it's the way they created the benchmark.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.600]   They kept testing models like O1
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.080]   until they found questions that O1 struggled on.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   Because DeepSeek R1 wasn't out yet,
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.000]   they couldn't do that kind of iteration on it,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.200]   so it's not fully accurate to say that it performs best
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.960]   because it is the smartest model.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.080]   As far as I can see,
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.640]   it tests heavily obscure knowledge
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.480]   on things like minute details of hummingbird anatomy.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.400]   Now, I will say that a model getting,
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.840]   say 90% on this benchmark will be amazing and incredible,
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.600]   and I would use that model,
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.000]   but I don't think it would be quite as impactful
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.520]   as a model getting, say, 90% on an agency benchmark,
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.600]   as I touched on at the beginning of this video.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.240]   An agent properly being able to do remote tasks
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.080]   would transform the world economy.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.600]   The New York Times reported
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.240]   that the original name for this particular benchmark
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   was Humanity's Last Stand,
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.640]   so I am glad they changed the title.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.360]   Let's hope it's not,
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.280]   because I could see this particular benchmark
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.360]   being crushed by the end of next year,
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.280]   if not even this year.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.400]   Man, that was a lot to cover in one video,
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.960]   so thank you so much for making it to the end.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.960]   As I say, I feel less sorry for myself
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.320]   and more sorry for the public
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.040]   who have to wade through countless random headlines
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.720]   to get to what's actually happening.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.880]   I've tried to do my best in this video,
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.560]   but let me know what you think.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.640]   As ever, thank you so much for watching
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.080]   and have a wonderful day.
