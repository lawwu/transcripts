[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from Financial Samurai. And in this episode, I want to talk
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:13.720]   about the 2023 Wall Street S&P 500 forecast, because I just got a look at 16 forecasts
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.460]   and the dispersion is huge. It doesn't look like anybody knows what's going to happen.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:29.400]   So the S&P 500 price target ranges between $3,675 to $4,500. This implies returns of
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:38.560]   between negative 9% to positive 12% based off the S&P 500 today at around $4,000. According
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:47.020]   to a Bloomberg survey, the average 2023 S&P 500 forecast is $4,900. So that's basically
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.080]   saying we're not going to go anywhere for 2023. And a recent Reuters poll of 41 Wall
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.040]   Street strategists shows a median S&P 500 price target of $4,200. So not bad, but that's
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.880]   5%, 5% increase for the year. Hey, we'll take it after a terrible 2022. But up 5% is not
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.520]   that inspiring. Knowing this range of S&P 500 price targets for 2023 is important because
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.120]   all investments, all risk asset classes are based off the risk free rate of return. So
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.440]   the risk free rate of return is the 10 year bond yield and the 10 year bond yield is about
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.440]   3.6%. So if you don't believe the S&P 500 is going to be greater than 3.6%, then you
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.920]   shouldn't be investing in the S&P 500. And you should be investing in 10 year Treasury
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.880]   bonds. But what's interesting right now is that there's a huge yield curve inversion.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.760]   So again, the 10 year bond yield is at 3.6%. But the one year Treasury bond yield is at
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:59.080]   about 4.7%. So that's a 1.2% inversion, which is the highest since 1981. And what's also
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.720]   interesting to note is that after every single yield curve inversion, especially a really
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.680]   deep inversion, a recession follows within the next 12 to 16 months. So I absolutely
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.200]   believe in 2023, we're going to see a recession, another recession, because we saw one technically
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.560]   in the first quarter and second quarter of 2022. And we're gonna see another one in 2023.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.720]   Maybe it's in the third and fourth quarter, because excess savings is getting spent down
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.360]   the Fed if the Fed hikes to 5% on the Fed funds rate and keeps it there for, let's say
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.920]   six months to eight months, we're going to see millions of job losses, millions of job
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.720]   losses. And that's what the federal wants to reign in inflation, which is already coming
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.080]   down. You've seen the PC numbers come down. We saw the October CPI numbers come down,
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.560]   we're probably gonna see the November numbers come down. So the trend is down and inflation,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.400]   just as it rose really quickly, can fall really quickly because the cure for inflation is
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.480]   higher prices. And that's what we saw. And then we've seen demand destruction. So the
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.840]   Fed continues to be aggressive as inflation rates are falling. We're probably going to
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.720]   be in a world of hurt. So hang on to your jobs, focus on being a good employee. Don't
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.320]   piss anybody off, keep your head down, come into the office earlier, leave later, this
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.760]   whole quiet quitting thing. It was interesting. It was it was good for like, I don't know,
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.040]   six months of quiet quitting, just do the minimum to not get fired. But now if you do
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.840]   the minimum, you're probably going to get let go, you're probably gonna get let go of
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.200]   the bottom 10%, 15% in a recession, generally always gets let go. Why wouldn't they get
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.720]   let go? If you were the boss, and you needed to cut costs, you're gonna let your bottom
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:51.640]   10 to 20% of performers go. Just look at Twitter. It's interesting because Elon has let go of
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.640]   75% of the staff, so thousands of people, yet Twitter is still running. Now some will
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.200]   argue, well, there's a freeze in, you know, the programming and the coding of Twitter.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   So that's why things don't break. That's what big tech companies do. They freeze the code
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.920]   during you know, big holidays and so forth. So things don't break. And as soon as they
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.840]   start adding new features and updating things, Twitter is going to start breaking and getting
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.520]   glitchy. But still, if you cut 75% of the workforce, and it's still working fine, and
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:27.240]   actually, the user base is growing, and the activity is growing. You should be worried,
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.180]   at least if you're in big tech, that there's a lot of fat to cut. There's always a lot
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.080]   of fat to cut. And there's more fat to cut. It's more apparent during a recession in a
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.320]   bear market. For 2023, the key risks to the S&P 500 performance now include earnings cuts
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.280]   and valuation multiple compression. So these two things were to happen, the S&P 500 could
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.880]   easily decline by 15%, 10-15% from current levels. Now, conversely, there could be greater
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.160]   than expected earnings cuts, everything is relative. But there could be a valuation increase
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.880]   right. So as earnings are get get cut, you know, the market doesn't go down as much,
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.400]   and therefore valuations increase. And this would occur if the market looks beyond the
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.480]   earnings cuts, because we just expect them to be cut. And then the market expects better
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.240]   times ahead. And the better times ahead could be as a result of the Fed pivoting sooner
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.980]   than expected sooner than let's say, March 2023. And they start saying, Hey, look, we
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.520]   see recognize inflation is coming down, we're not going to raise anymore. And we're actually
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.160]   going to start cutting sooner than expected. That could easily reignite the bull market
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.320]   and get the S&P 500 back to let's say, 4500. And I do personally believe the worst of the
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:52.680]   bear market is over when the S&P 500 hit 3577 in mid October 2022. What matters most is
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.560]   what the Fed plans to do over the next 12 months. I've written in my previous posts
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:05.120]   and newsletters how maddening it is to be a public company CEO, because you can improve
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.200]   operational efficiency, expand margins, grow revenue and grow profits. And you could still
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.520]   see your stock price go down because the stock market is basically, I would say 80 plus percent
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.400]   controlled by what the Fed is doing. Don't fight the Fed on the way up or down. As Asana
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.960]   billionaire CEO Dustin Moskowitz wisely quipped, I'm CEO of the Asana company, but lately,
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.080]   Jay Powell has been CEO of the stock price. And sadly, this scenario will likely continue
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:43.560]   to be true for the next 12 months. So the positive about this, so the positive is that,
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.680]   hey, you could be really sucking wind into your company. But if the Fed pivots and starts
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.520]   injecting liquidity back into the system and starts lowering interest rates again, your
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.960]   stock price could do well. It might not outperform the broader markets, but it could actually
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.720]   start going up again. So let me share some of the prognostications of the various Wall
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.520]   Street analysts from bearish to neutral to bullish. So let's see, SG has a 3800 target
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:17.520]   price and it says our quote hard soft landing scenario sees EPS growth rebounding to 0%
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:24.200]   in 2023. Rebounding to 0%. We expect the index to trade in a wide range as we see negative
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:31.200]   profit growth in the first half of 2023. A Fed pivot in June 2023. China reopening by
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:37.360]   a third quarter 2023 and a recession in the US in the first quarter of 2024. That's interesting
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.960]   that they say in the first quarter 2024, I would think it'd be a little bit sooner. And
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.880]   China is actually reopening now because there have been so many protests and you're seeing
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.920]   the COVID zero policy get a little bit softer now. Just check out the news. They're getting
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.520]   a little bit more lenient about allowing people to have more freedom. All right, Mike Wilson
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.800]   from Morgan Stanley, he is supposedly the number one rated institutional investor strategist.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:10.200]   He has a target of 3900. So what is that? Two and a half, 3% below current levels. He
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:17.720]   has an EPS of $195 per share for the S&P 500. And he says this leaves us 16% below consensus
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:24.320]   for 2023 in our base case and down 11% from a year over year growth standpoint. So that's
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.360]   below consensus. He believes consensus will come down. So he believes consensus will come
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:37.120]   down and he sees a price trough of between 3000 to 3300. Now that if that happens is
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:43.600]   going to be very, very painful because that's another what 20% downside from here. And if
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.560]   that happens, there's going to be blood on the streets and that might force the Fed to
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.520]   pivot finally. All right, now let's look at a couple of the neutral houses, my old stomping
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:01.680]   grounds Goldman Sachs has a 4000 target, so no growth, 224 EPS. The performance of US
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:09.240]   stocks in 2022 was all about a painful valuation derating. But the equity story for 2023 will
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:15.560]   be about the lack of EPS growth. Okay, therefore zero earnings growth will match zero appreciation
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.920]   in the S&P 500. That sounds like it makes sense, but that's probably not what's going
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.640]   to happen. The market always discounts something. They're not going to simply say no earnings
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.240]   growth, no S&P 500 growth, there's always some kind of change. Credit Suisse, they have
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:37.400]   a target of 4050. So two and a half percent upside, they have an EPS estimate of 230.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:43.660]   And they say 2023 is a year of weak, non recessionary growth and falling inflation. All right, finally,
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:50.120]   the most bullish Wall Street house is Deutsche Bank with a 4500 target price. So a 12 and
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:57.160]   a half percent upside from the recording of this podcast $195 EPS per share. So that's
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.000]   interesting. They've got the highest target price, yet they have one of the lowest EPS
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.680]   per shares. As you recall, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs had like a $230 EPS per share.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.240]   So this is the case where they think there's going to be a valuation re rating, I guess
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:19.160]   valuations go up, and the stock market goes up because investors will be discounting the
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.120]   current unpleasant times and better times in the future. So Deutsche Bank writes, equity
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:30.040]   markets are projected to move higher in the near term, plunge as the US recession hits,
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:36.400]   and then recovers fairly quickly. We see the S&P 500 at 4500 in the first half, down more
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:44.680]   than 25% in Q3, and back to 4500 by year end 2023. So wow, now that is a roller coaster.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:51.960]   Are you kidding me? So up 12 and a half percent by you know, Q2, I guess, and then down 25%
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:58.720]   in Q3, and then back right up. Come on now, that's, it seems totally ridiculous. But the
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.280]   truth is, nobody knows the future. And that's what they're predicting. And everybody has
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.840]   the right to predict where they see the stock market to be and then invest accordingly.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:15.360]   So some of you have asked, what am I doing with my money? Well, in 2022, I thought, okay,
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:23.040]   maybe there might be 5%, 4 or 5% upside to the S&P 500 to 5000. But I also said that
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:29.920]   there would be greater than a 60% chance there would be a 10% drop in the S&P 500. So I didn't
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:36.200]   have strong, strong conviction to sell aggressively, but I was cautious. And I had about 30% of
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:43.160]   my net worth in public equities, which resulted quite now in about a 15 to 16% decline. Losing
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:49.100]   money stinks, but we've had a great 10 year run. But for 2023, it's really interesting
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:56.680]   because we now have one year treasury bonds yielding 4.7%. So if you take 4.7%, and times
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:04.720]   it by 4000 on the S&P 500 at this current moment, you get 4188. And if you look at the
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:13.440]   Wall Street strategist forecast, 4188 is in the top quintile, top quintile of forecast.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.200]   So I think if, if we get there, I think most of us will be happy because we didn't lose
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:26.240]   money. And so if you can get a guaranteed 4.7%, right with no risk, and there's tax
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.660]   advantage of not having to pay state income capital gains tax on treasury bonds, that's
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:37.200]   really attractive for those in New York, Hawaii, California, and other high income tax states,
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:43.320]   then why not allocate the majority of your cash flow and savings to one year treasury
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.080]   bonds, it's the most relatively attractive treasury bond, again, because the 10 year
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:55.000]   bond yield is about 3.6%. For the remaining 30 to 40% of my cash flow, I'm going to be
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.800]   opportunistic and buy the S&P 500. If it's below 3800, if it gets below 3800, I'm buying
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.720]   more aggressively again. But right now just nibble here and there at 4000. It's just doesn't
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.480]   seem that attractive. In terms of real estate, I think real estate prices are going to fall
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:18.560]   like 10 to 15% by sometime in 2023. And then you're gonna have an opportunity to buy again,
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.360]   because the Fed is going to cut rates, and then demand will come back as mortgage rates
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.240]   decline, I totally see mortgage rates declining by two to 3%. So the average 30 year fixed
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.680]   mortgage rate could decline from a high of 7% down to four and a half to 5%. And when
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.720]   that happens, you better have some cash if you want to buy a new primary resident, or
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   some rental properties, because I think the demand is going to whiplash back. So what
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.940]   else am I doing? Well, I'm definitely maxing out my tax advantage retirement accounts.
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:53.840]   So I just had the SEP IRA, because I have financial samurai as a small business. I do
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:59.200]   have a solo 401k, but I would have to do some freelance work to earn freelance income to
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.360]   contribute to that solo 401k. But if I do do any work, I'm going to be contributing
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:11.920]   the max that I can. For employees, you can contribute 22,500 pre tax to your 401ks in
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:17.740]   2023. That's up from 20,500. So you best take advantage of that. Two, I'm going to contribute
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:25.680]   the gift tax limit maximum of 17,000 to each of my kids 529 plans. I super funded my son's
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:34.640]   529 plan in 2017. So 2023, I can re-zoom contributing. And I think in retrospect, yeah, it was a
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:40.640]   good move, super funding, I just forgot about it. Let the market do what it would do. And
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.720]   here we are again. So I'm just going to contribute more to both son and daughters 529 plans.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.200]   Three, I'm going to put the kids to work, see if they can earn at least $6,500 from
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:57.000]   our online business, and then invest that money in their respective Roth IRAs, right
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.640]   Roth IRA, you contribute after tax money. But if you earn below the standard deduction
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:10.560]   limit for 2023 of 13,850, you don't pay tax on that. And then the Roth IRA money compounds
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.160]   tax free and then you can withdraw it tax free. So it's like a triple win, no brainer.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:21.000]   And the big no brainer for parents is to teach our children work ethic, the value of money
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.640]   and money management skills. And then finally, as long as I can get over a 4% risk free rate
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:32.480]   of return on treasuries, I'll be allocating 60 plus percent of my cash flow to buying
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:38.400]   treasury bonds. And then if the S&P 500 gets below 3,800 again, I hope it doesn't, but
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:44.240]   it clearly easily could. I'll start allocating 60 plus percent of my cash flow to buying
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:50.000]   the S&P 500 index regardless of where the one year treasury bond yield level is. I mean,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.840]   obviously, if it's higher, I'm going to allocate that 40% to buying as much treasury
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.840]   bonds as possible. So you got to look at the levels, everything's relative, the risk free
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:05.600]   rate of return. And this is just for my stock and bond allocation capital, capital allocation,
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.640]   right? I've got private equity, you know, venture capital, venture debt, private real
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:16.240]   estate and physical real estate. But we can talk more about those other asset classes
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:23.160]   in another episode. So I'd love to hear what your forecasts are for the S&P 500 in 2023.
