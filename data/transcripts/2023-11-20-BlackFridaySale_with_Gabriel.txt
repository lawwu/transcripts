[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.840]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.480]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.760]   My name is Josh Ruchite and today on the show I am thrilled to welcome back my friend and
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.960]   business partner, he of the Watchman Privacy Platform, Gabriel Custodiate.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.640]   Gabriel, welcome back to the show for the bazillionth time.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.760]   Hey Josh, how's it going?
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.080]   Very well, sir, very well.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.680]   So we are here to do a little bit of promotion.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.400]   You and I have collaborated now on, I guess it's been about three different projects,
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.720]   three different courses that we have done.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.760]   We've had a lot of students go through them, a lot of great feedback, and we're updating
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.480]   them and we are putting them on sale today.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.480]   So we didn't do a ton of planning before this episode.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.480]   Where do you want to begin?
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.600]   Yeah, so let's just give them the lay of the land here.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.360]   It seems like three courses.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.360]   It's been two.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.320]   We have the BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com and the HackProofCourse.com.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.260]   These were going to be 50% off basically for the rest of November.
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.600]   So 50% off for both of those courses.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.400]   You should definitely go pick up both of those.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.820]   We'll have links in the show notes, in the description.
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.640]   You can also, from one of them, click on the profile and get to the other.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.240]   But that's kind of the main thing.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.960]   All of November, they're going to be 50% off.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.440]   And I want to say something to the audience, and I love your audience.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.000]   I love my audience.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I want to say this.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   So we see these statistics and we know that not everyone who follows radical personal
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.400]   finance has purchased, in this case, let's talk about the Bitcoin Privacy Course.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.600]   That's one of our favorites.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.480]   And to me, that's not an acceptable statistic, especially if you care about your finances
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.480]   and your future.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.040]   So we're trying to help you.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.560]   And I was trying to think, what would be the turnoffs for people?
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.480]   And so I understand if some people think that, let's say, Bitcoin and crypto are beyond their
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.000]   abilities.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.160]   But in the course, we explain Bitcoin at a step-by-step level.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.480]   We don't miss the forest for the trees.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.280]   We don't get overly complicated.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.760]   There's an introductory element to the course, and I'm showing you on screen everything I'm
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.760]   doing.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.040]   And of course, lack of knowledge is not an excuse to avoid the greatest monetary freedom
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   tool ever created.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.760]   And that's a conclusion that I've arrived at for Bitcoin in the last couple of years
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.640]   of studying this and writing a book on it that's coming out soon.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.440]   So others of you, and I'm speaking again to you, audience, I'm speaking to you, John and
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.840]   Natalie and Robert, who's driving in the car right now.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.600]   If you think that you already have it figured out, probably there's a few of you, right?
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.880]   But I want to tell you that owning Bitcoin and Coinbase is not owning Bitcoin.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.440]   You don't own Bitcoin if you have it through Coinbase or Swan or any other exchange.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.040]   In fact, you're more in danger if you own Bitcoin and Coinbase than if you didn't own
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.040]   any Bitcoin.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.080]   You're KYC, that stands for know your customer.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.160]   You've been slapped with the mark of the beast, even though you thought you were avoiding
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.160]   it.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.800]   You've been deceived about what Bitcoin ownership actually is.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   So we talked about in this course about how to get actual Bitcoin, private Bitcoin, and
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.480]   privately that you yourself can possess without any intermediary.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.840]   So finally, I would say there's probably two other groups of people who are kind of hesitant
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.080]   to get into Bitcoin.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.080]   And the first one is maybe you're just not interested for some reason, and I think you
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.280]   should be.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.520]   And the other is people who think Bitcoin is a scam because they listen to Peter Schiff
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.400]   and they told him so.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.840]   He told him so.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.080]   And what I'll say is Bitcoin has been going on for 14 years now.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.200]   14 years ago, it was set into motion and it has been going ever since.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.640]   And it has had at certain times a $1 trillion bounty to hack Bitcoin.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.160]   And of course, it has not been hacked, not even close.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.100]   It is not going to be hacked.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.100]   It's a fabulous tool.
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.800]   So it's not going anywhere.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.280]   It works today.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.440]   I'm not talking about investment or speculation.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.520]   Of course, if you want to do that, you can.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.020]   I'm talking about as a freedom tool.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.360]   I can use Bitcoin today to buy pretty much most essential things I want in the world.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.880]   I can send Bitcoin to someone else anywhere in the world, any amount, and it's going to
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.300]   get to them in a reasonable amount of time with no possibility of censorship.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.980]   That is amazing.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:21.980]   That is astounding.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.540]   That is the strongest property, as some people have noted, that you can have in the world
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.020]   today.
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.780]   So Bitcoin is digital money and it's widely accepted now and it simply works.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.980]   So I respect Peter Schiff's economics and I understand his critique of blind speculation
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.180]   in Bitcoin, like products, but nothing he says about actual Bitcoin should be a reason
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.380]   to discourage you.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.820]   So maybe you're a gold bug, right?
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.060]   And I'll say, try transporting gold around the world in the case of an emergency.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.080]   I took a domestic flight with some pieces of silver a few months ago, and just that,
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.080]   they took me inside for interrogation, right?
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.700]   If you think that gold is going to help you during an emergency situation where you have
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.700]   to escape the country or something, it's not going to happen.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.340]   Bitcoin is going to happen, right?
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.820]   When you have a Bitcoin seed phrase, which is 12 words, you have that in your head, you
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.900]   walk anywhere on earth, you type it into a computer on the other side and you have access
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.200]   to that.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.380]   So I need you to understand how powerful of a privacy tool this is.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.180]   Everyone listening right now needs to be in this course.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.940]   It's 50% off right now.
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.260]   There's nothing like it on the internet.
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.220]   I listened and I read for hundreds of hours in preparation of this.
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.700]   Nobody explained it in the basic pared down way that I did.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.760]   I think it's fabulous.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.820]   And I think all of you should definitely be in the Bitcoin course.
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.920]   We also have a hack proof course, which I won't explain in too much detail, but it helps
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.340]   you to avoid being part of the $10 trillion cybercrime statistic, which you will inevitably
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.860]   be in if you don't take the necessary steps to do so.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.660]   So those are our two courses.
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.580]   And I think everyone should be in both of them.
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.540]   Yeah, 100% agree.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.780]   On the on our Bitcoin course right now, we have a 96% five star rating and a 4% four
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.380]   star rating and no ones, twos and threes.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.500]   And I don't think we've had a single unhappy customer.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.500]   Do you remember anyone?
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.940]   I don't I don't think we've had a single request for refund or anything like that.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.940]   Or like that.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.940]   Correct?
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.940]   No.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.940]   Yeah, no, we don't.
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.300]   And we're checking email and I'm taking the feedback all the time.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.100]   So people send me questions sometimes and I just answer them.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.340]   So that's kind of who we are.
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.340]   We're not some weird corporate giant.
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.180]   We're not we're going to send you in a loop.
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.980]   We're here to sell you something if you don't want it, we refund it.
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.100]   And if you need some help, I'm often willing to help you.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.100]   So that's how it goes.
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.460]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.380]   And we take people from a zero knowledge base to everything you need to know how to clean
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.740]   up your devices, how to get proper wallets, how to own it, how to buy it, how to use it,
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.740]   etc.
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.740]   It's fantastic.
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:56.020]   So BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com use coupon code BlackFriday50.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.460]   Black Friday 50 in order to save 50% here during the month of November.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.020]   I don't want to skip over HackProof course, though.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.740]   What do you want to say about that, Gabriel?
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.980]   Yeah, so the HackProof course, for whatever reason, wasn't as interesting to people as
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.980]   the Bitcoin course.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.060]   And I understand that.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.260]   But look, I talk to people all the time.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.940]   And I talk to friends and family who have been scammed.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.500]   I have great operational security.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.140]   I still get all these scam emails all the time.
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.620]   And all it takes is one click and one type in of your login credentials and boom, you're
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.980]   out $50 or $100.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:36.060]   We're selling this course for around $50 after the discount.
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:43.100]   And this is knowledge that will help you lock down dozens, if not hundreds of aspects of
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:52.500]   your life, teach you how to recognize scams, avoid them by email, by phone call, how to
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.040]   protect yourself against identity theft, protect you against getting your accounts hacked.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.740]   This is, again, a four hour course that is essential.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.100]   Like anybody who uses the internet needs to understand this stuff.
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:09.380]   And just like the Bitcoin course, I tried to pare it down as best I can in a way that
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.700]   a lot of people, to be honest, don't talk about.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.540]   They don't understand that these things at the kind of fundamental level that I tried
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.760]   to explain it up.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.340]   So that's hackproofcourse.com also 50% off.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:26.500]   And if you want to be part of the $10 trillion cybercrime industry statistics, keep doing
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.500]   what you're doing.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.540]   If you don't want to, then go buy this course and listen to it and learn from it.
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.540]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.500]   One of my new year's resolutions, I've done okay, better than most people, not as good
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:41.340]   as you, but one of my new year's resolutions for this next year, one of my plans.
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:48.460]   Throughout the year is I'm going to systematically fix a few of the holes in my own, in my own
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.460]   structure.
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:54.300]   I let a few holes open up just due to neglect on a couple of different things.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.900]   And I'm going to be going through systematically this next year and fixing that.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.140]   Like I said, the course, when it's 50% off, we normally sell the course for $97.
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.700]   When it's 50% off, it's less than 50 bucks.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.900]   Bitcoin course, we normally sell it right now for $139, 50% off.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.500]   It's 70 bucks.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.540]   So buy those right now.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:19.380]   Bitcoin privacy course.com, hackproof course.com.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.980]   Anything else you want to add Gabriel?
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.480]   I think your point about new year's resolutions is great.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.200]   These are excellent new year's resolutions.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:32.500]   Do you want to own something, a monetary tool that is more resilient than any other monetary
