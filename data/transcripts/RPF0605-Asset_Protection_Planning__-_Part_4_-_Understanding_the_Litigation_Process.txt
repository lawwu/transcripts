[00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.100]   Today, we continue part four of our
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.680]   Asset Protection Planning for Mere Mortals series.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.080]   Part one, I laid out for you a very broad overview
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.620]   of asset protection planning,
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.220]   encourage you to consider the assets
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.840]   that are important to you and define the risks
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.960]   that those assets face,
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.960]   and then consider protection strategies very broadly.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.700]   In part two, we talked about the morality and legality
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.760]   of asset protection planning,
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.600]   specifically here referring to financial assets
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.600]   and engaging in legal planning to make it harder
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.500]   for a creditor to collect against you.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.240]   And I defended the idea that it is both legal and moral
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240]   for you to make your assets hard to seize.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.680]   And in episode part three of this series,
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.520]   I laid out for you the problem that we're protecting against.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.220]   And the summary thesis of that show
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.820]   was simply it's not good enough for you to expect
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.000]   to be a prudent and careful person
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.900]   and think that you'll be okay
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.900]   if you're just a prudent, careful person.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.600]   It's not good enough for you to simply trust
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.960]   the court system and say, "Well, if I'm wrong,
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.240]   "I don't mind paying for the things that I've gotten wrong,
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.100]   "and I can just trust that the judge and the jury,
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.500]   "if there's a jury involved,
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.040]   "they'll work out the details and I don't mind."
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.480]   It's not good enough.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.680]   In today's world, that simply is,
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.920]   it's a fantasy to believe that you can just simply
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.180]   be prudent and that the courts will find justice.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.020]   That's a fantasy.
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.420]   And so I sought to make that claim in part three.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.520]   Today in part four, I'm going to talk to you
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.120]   about the overall litigation process
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.000]   to explain to you how the process works
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.400]   so that you understand the legalities involved
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.440]   in the process of litigation.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.640]   The majority of asset protection planning
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.800]   that we're concerned about will involve a legal case.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.940]   That's because in the United States,
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.240]   we're dealing in a society that's largely driven
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.580]   by rule of law.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.580]   We're not so much concerned about somebody
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.580]   sneaking into your house, putting a gun to your head,
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.480]   and forcing you to open up your safe.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.320]   That is a component of asset protection planning,
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.920]   and you should plan for that.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.700]   But when I use the term, the understood common meaning
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.160]   of the term is not what kind of security system
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.520]   do you install around your compound?
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.900]   It's the common meaning of the term is,
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.640]   how do you protect it so that the person
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.140]   that you ran into at a stop sign and hurt their neck,
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.780]   how do you protect so that they don't take all your money?
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.180]   Because you slipped and pressed the gas
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.940]   when you were supposed to press the brakes.
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.580]   And so usually we're dealing here with a legal process.
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.420]   The legal process will be looked over
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.300]   and run by the judge, by a court system,
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.700]   and the process is fairly laid out.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.500]   But this is a process that is generally opaque
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.660]   to most of us.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.800]   For most of us, the first time that we come in contact
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.780]   with somebody who is seeking to take all of our money
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.980]   because they believe that we have wronged them
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.940]   is when the lawsuit is served,
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.540]   or when we first get an inkling of it.
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.580]   And that's the first time we're ever aware
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.740]   of how this legal process works.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.180]   So I wanna explain it to you so that you understand it,
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.300]   and so that you can do the planning now
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.940]   that needs to be done in order to protect your assets.
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.460]   The first thing you need to hear very loud and clear
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.920]   in the beginning of today's show is,
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.640]   you must, in order for asset protection planning
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.560]   to be maximally effective,
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.760]   you must put in place the strategies
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.640]   that will shelter and protect your assets
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.840]   before anything happens
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.200]   that could lead somebody to file a claim against you
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.000]   or to bring a lawsuit against you.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.840]   You need to actually put the structures in place
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.160]   before the facts occur.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.540]   In the United States, and in most countries around the world
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.140]   or most listeners are based,
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.400]   there is a body of law that comes under the,
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.340]   label, heading, the heading of fraudulent transfer law
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.460]   or fraudulent conveyance law.
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.460]   Depending on what state you are in,
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.380]   it'll be referred to slightly different,
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.020]   but let's just call it the fraudulent transfer law.
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.540]   Fraudulent transfer law goes a long way back.
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.720]   And the simple idea is this.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.860]   If I owe you money,
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.740]   let's say I owe you $1,000,
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.900]   and all I have is $1,000,
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.060]   I can't go over to my buddy on the backside of my house
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.380]   and say, "Hey, here neighbor, here's $1,000."
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.020]   And then when you come looking for your $1,000,
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.980]   I had to say, "I don't have it."
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.040]   And then you're just left empty-handed.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.980]   Meanwhile, a week later, after you've gone on your way,
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.220]   I'll go back to my neighbor and say,
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.620]   "Hey buddy, how about sending me back over the 1,000 bucks
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.160]   and hey, here's $100 for your trouble."
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.320]   It simply can't do that.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.320]   And so the US courts are empowered to protect against that.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.880]   And judges have massive powers to make sure
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.600]   that a creditor is protected against you
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.900]   fraudulently taking the creditor's money
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.560]   and giving it somewhere else,
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.180]   trying to spend it yourself,
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.540]   wasting an asset or transferring an asset to somebody else.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.660]   Now we can study this law,
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.840]   and I think I'll do an entire segment on it
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.320]   because you need to understand how it works
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.920]   and it's fairly well codified
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.160]   so that you can understand how to put it in place.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.120]   But the key fact that most people miss
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.340]   in this planning is simply this.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.860]   When we are trying to analyze
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.420]   any kind of fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance,
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.700]   a person's or a claimant's creditor status
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.960]   occurs at the time that the facts occur,
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.040]   the facts that actually lead to the claim,
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.680]   not when the claim is asserted or the lawsuit is initiated.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.700]   So pretend for a moment that I drive into you at a stop sign.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.560]   You're sitting at a stop sign, minding your own business.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.360]   I'm staring down at my phone, texting,
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.560]   and I drive into the back of your car
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.860]   and you hurt your neck.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.820]   I can't go home after that accident
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.740]   and immediately start moving money
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.180]   and expect at that point in time
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.540]   that those transfers will be protected
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.340]   because you haven't sued me yet.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:54.020]   It's the actual facts and the time that they occur
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.380]   that makes the difference on assets I can transfer.
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.260]   If a day before the accident,
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.000]   I happened to give my brother $100,000,
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.660]   and then the accident happens,
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.820]   and then all of a sudden we find out that,
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.560]   wow, that would actually turned out pretty well
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.160]   because you would have gotten
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.540]   that $100,000 out of me in court.
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.320]   Well, it's immaterial.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.020]   It happened before the facts.
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.940]   But if the day after the accident occurs,
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.060]   I give my brother $100,000,
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.460]   now we have a serious problem
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.780]   'cause a judge will reverse that transfer
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.500]   and a judge will force me to get the $100,000 back
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.800]   and to give it to you if, assuming in the end,
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.140]   that you win your lawsuit against me
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.860]   and I owe you $100,000.
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:40.100]   The Fraudulent Transfer Act covers the transfers
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.340]   and it's based upon the time that the facts occur,
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.900]   not when a case is filed.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.220]   So you can't just sit around and say,
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.300]   well, I'll wait for a lawsuit
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.620]   or I'll wait and see what happens.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.940]   You have to act today.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.780]   Hope that's clear.
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.900]   Keep it in mind.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.500]   Asset protection planning is one of the things
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.580]   that you have to do far in advance
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.040]   of ever needing it
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.160]   in order for it to be maximally effective.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.680]   So what actually happens in a lawsuit?
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.800]   How does the actual process work
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.440]   between certain facts occurring,
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.860]   the company manufacturing and selling the faulty product,
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.060]   the surgeon slipping and botching a surgery,
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.480]   the individual walking down the street
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.400]   or driving their car and accidentally
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.360]   running somebody over, running over a child?
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.960]   Well, how does this process work
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.880]   between the time of the incident occurring
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.460]   and you actually forking over your money
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.940]   to the person who wins a lawsuit against you?
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:45.000]   Well, we begin rather obviously with a situation occurring,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.400]   the facts, the certain events happening,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.400]   whatever those events are.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.880]   And in the wake of those events,
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.840]   the person involved in those events
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.360]   or the people involved or the company involved
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.920]   will do an analysis of those events.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.720]   And at some point in time, they'll think,
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.560]   hey, you know what?
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.400]   I have a legal case here.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.320]   I'm gonna sue so-and-so for wronging me.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.300]   I'm gonna sue this company for wronging me.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.640]   And at that point in time,
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.640]   they will start to do an economic analysis of the case.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.400]   Let's start with the simplest form of economic analysis,
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.280]   wherein a plaintiff,
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.320]   the person who's bringing the lawsuit,
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.000]   a plaintiff or a potential plaintiff
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.920]   is simply going to hire an attorney.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.120]   You come into my place of business
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.960]   and you wrong me in some way.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.480]   And I say, I'm gonna sue you.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.320]   I go to my attorney that I work with
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.440]   and I say to this attorney,
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.960]   we're gonna sue this person over here.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.120]   And I just want you to sue them for this reason,
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.800]   such and such, and I'll just simply pay your fees.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   Well, this is called an hourly fee basis
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.960]   of hiring an attorney.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.120]   And many attorneys, most attorneys will work this way.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.160]   You pay them a stated hourly fee for their work.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.240]   They will bill you.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.360]   They'll bill you for their time.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.800]   They'll bill you for their paralegals' time.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.960]   They'll bill you for their costs incurred.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.440]   Those bills will range usually from a few hundred dollars
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.120]   an hour at the lowest to several thousand dollars an hour
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   for the highest and highest priced attorneys out there.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.040]   Well, in this situation,
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.600]   I'm going to have to search my budget
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.120]   and decide how much am I willing to pay
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.680]   this attorney in fees,
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.680]   especially given the likelihood of winning a case
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.000]   or of achieving a settlement,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.480]   basically of getting money out of you.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.780]   How much am I willing to pay?
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.480]   Now, there are some people who will use attorneys
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.720]   as part of an overall business strategy.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.040]   That's beyond the scope of what we're doing today.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.280]   Let's assume people are pragmatic.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.760]   The most important thing to recognize
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.240]   is when somebody is simply paying hourly fees
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.400]   to their legal counsel,
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.840]   they're going to be thinking about
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.880]   what am I actually gonna get out of this?
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.580]   Consider it like this.
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:07.800]   You drive a nice, fancy car,
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.480]   and your car is parked in the parking lot outside your work.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.920]   And the local bum,
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.840]   pushing their shopping cart full of all their possessions,
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.280]   comes into that parking lot
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.100]   and mistakenly scratches your car and messes it up.
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.440]   Somehow the wind is a gust of wind
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.920]   and it blows the whole heavy shopping cart
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.560]   into the side of your car and makes a nice big dent.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.600]   You rush out furious and say,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.600]   "Listen, bum, you messed up my car."
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.960]   And the bum says, "Sorry,"
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.920]   and grabs the cart and shuffles away.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.280]   Now, compare that to, you know,
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.600]   wealthy person driving a fancy car,
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.440]   pulls into the car,
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.120]   accidentally backs into your car and causes problems.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.040]   The bum, you're not gonna be very incentivized.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.880]   What are you gonna do,
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.200]   chase them down and take their shopping cart
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.160]   and list it on eBay so that you can come up with 32 cents
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160]   to try to paint your car?
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.460]   It's absurd.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.320]   They don't have money,
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.480]   and so you're not gonna pursue that very far.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.000]   But you would pursue your claim
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.480]   against the wealthy person who's driving a nice car,
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.520]   you would pursue it until you're satisfied,
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.080]   until your car is made right.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.640]   You would pursue it, of course, informally,
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.960]   in that silly little case I made up.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.240]   You would pursue it informally.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.720]   You might pursue it through the insurance company,
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.600]   but if nothing happened,
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.680]   you might be even willing to pursue it in a court of law,
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.880]   take it to small claims court and say,
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.760]   "Listen, this guy backed into my car,
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.840]   and he needs to make it right and fix it."
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.100]   So you, as a person,
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.600]   you will do an analysis, an economic analysis,
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.720]   and decide how much am I willing to pay
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.640]   this particular attorney.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.520]   Now, the other way that attorneys take on clients
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.680]   is with what's called a contingency fee.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.240]   And in a contingency fee,
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.200]   the attorney is not going to charge you by the hour.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.160]   Rather, they're going to specify a fee
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.480]   that's based upon a percentage
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.520]   of any money they can recover for you.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.880]   Usually that's perhaps a third of the money
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.680]   the case settled before trial,
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.000]   and about 40% if it goes to trial, something like that.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.040]   So now the attorney is involved.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.440]   And since usually only large companies
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.760]   or very wealthy people can actually afford
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.240]   to pay an attorney on an hourly basis,
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.840]   most of the types of lawsuits
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.920]   that you and I might be subject to
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.580]   are going to be handled on a contingency fee.
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.000]   Now, in this case, the plaintiff,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.400]   the person who has the actual fact
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.640]   that they're concerned with,
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.360]   will take those facts to an attorney
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.920]   and will lay them out for the attorney.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.040]   And the attorney is going to be involved
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.140]   in the economic analysis.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.680]   Because the attorney is going to front the money,
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.160]   and the attorney is going to front all the money
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.360]   for the depositions, the legal costs, et cetera,
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.280]   all along the way.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.760]   And they're going to invest many hours of their time
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.280]   hoping for the big payoff.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.960]   And so they're first going to analyze the case
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.720]   to see does the case have merit?
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.600]   And is there some way I can help the case to have merit?
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.000]   Is there some way that I can create a case here
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.200]   that I think will stick, that based upon the facts,
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.600]   as they've actually occurred,
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.600]   that will help me to actually win the ultimate judgment?
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.840]   And of course, the attorney might investigate those facts.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.840]   They might investigate, hire somebody,
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.200]   do some initial investigation to figure it out.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.900]   But the attorney is also going to engage
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.480]   an economic analysis.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.120]   And they're going to try to figure out what's in it for me.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.700]   How am I going to make this thing work out?
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.220]   In order for the case to work out,
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.040]   the attorney and the plaintiff have to find somebody
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.740]   who might actually be able to pay.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.440]   You might desperately want the bum with the shopping cart
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.640]   to fix your car.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.040]   Sorry, the bum's not going to do it.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.720]   They don't have the money.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.880]   And so legal cases are much like that.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.960]   Somebody might want economic satisfaction
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.440]   for the wrong that they have suffered.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.960]   But unless they can find somebody with money,
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.680]   there's a good chance that's not going to happen.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.960]   And so it's very likely that the attorney
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.800]   is going to hire somebody to do an asset search,
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.840]   a financial investigation on the potential claimant,
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.360]   or the, sorry, the potential defendant,
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.000]   on the potential people that they could name in the lawsuit.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.760]   Now, this is a fairly standardized process
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.240]   for some private investigators
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.120]   who specialize in this type of work.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.160]   I have an interest in it.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.980]   I've studied a bunch of the techniques that they use.
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.960]   There are some techniques that are entirely simple
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.120]   and easy and honest and legal.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.640]   There are techniques that are shady and illegal,
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.240]   but are still done all the time, every day.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.160]   And so somebody will do a financial asset search for you.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.000]   And they'll try to create a profile
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.760]   of how much money you and other people have
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.680]   so that they can understand if you're worth suing.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.240]   And depending on what's actually found out
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.840]   as a result of that financial asset investigation,
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.040]   that will probably influence
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.300]   how the lawsuit is pressed forward.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.280]   Again, only the wealthiest of people
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.520]   or the wealthiest of companies
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.580]   are simply going to pay an attorney an hourly fee
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.880]   to sue you regardless of their potential to collect.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.880]   People are generally, in this case, generally pragmatic.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.520]   And if they don't think they're gonna collect money,
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.600]   then what's the point of spending thousands and thousands
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.480]   and tens of thousands of dollars to pursue a legal case?
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.480]   Now, this is one of your first methods of protection,
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:32.260]   and that's privacy around your assets.
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:37.160]   Depending on the amount of target that's laid on you,
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.280]   it may or may not be at all possible
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.280]   for you to have total privacy around your assets.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.200]   I'll talk more about financial privacy,
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.120]   but the thing you must realize is
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.000]   if the incentive is high enough,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.040]   somebody could ultimately, if they're willing to pay,
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.440]   somebody could ultimately find out
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.760]   about just about everything you do.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.800]   So you can never rely on privacy.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.080]   You might have a magnificent house
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.880]   that you hold in a private trust
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.360]   that nobody could prove that you live there.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.440]   But if somebody follows you home from your office
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.840]   and a private investigator tails you home,
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.720]   then they can start to figure out,
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.180]   oh, that's where so-and-so lives.
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.100]   Now I understand where they live.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.920]   You might, I'll skip all the other examples for now,
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.500]   but privacy is an important first strategy
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.480]   because it helps to protect you at this stage
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.020]   of the financial investigation and the litigation process,
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.600]   but it's not the ultimate thing.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.200]   You can never rely just on privacy.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.840]   If a financial investigator
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.320]   is unable to locate significant assets,
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.200]   doesn't mean they don't exist,
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.240]   but if they can't locate significant assets,
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.840]   then there's a very good chance
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.480]   that the lawsuit will never proceed past this point.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.560]   There's a good chance that the attorney will say
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.640]   to the plaintiff, listen, I'd like to take the case,
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.280]   but I'm not gonna take it on a contingency fee basis,
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.760]   but I'd be happy to take it on an hourly basis.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.160]   Well, very few plaintiffs would have
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.860]   the tens of thousands of dollars
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.680]   to be able to agree to paying an attorney their hourly fees.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.960]   So this would substantially narrow
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.280]   the number of potential plaintiffs
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.400]   that would bring a case against you.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.120]   But if substantial assets are located,
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.880]   then there's a good chance that a lawsuit,
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.980]   regardless of its legal merits, will be filed against you.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.060]   So this is the pre-filing stage
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.240]   where there's a financial economic analysis
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.240]   and a financial investigation that comes into your affairs.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.560]   Now, if the attorney and the plaintiff
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.240]   can come to an agreement,
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.200]   we move into the actual filing of the lawsuit.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.960]   In this case, a complaint is prepared,
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.720]   and that complaint is filed with the local court.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.960]   And the key thing to recognize here
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.600]   is the complaint doesn't have to have all the details.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.240]   The lawsuit doesn't actually have
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.960]   to have all the details.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.280]   After the lawsuit is filed,
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.600]   you move into a discovery phase
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.140]   where the case will come out.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.360]   The complaint itself, at times, can be somewhat vague,
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.560]   and it may not have all the facts behind it.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.780]   Just because you've been careful in all your dealings
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.920]   doesn't mean that somebody can't file a complaint
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.960]   and you be called in to defend yourself.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.880]   Just because somebody's lawsuit is,
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.360]   I'm avoiding the use of the word frivolous,
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.880]   but is not exactly strong
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.280]   doesn't mean you might not wind up in a situation
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.360]   of spending lots of money on legal help to defend yourself
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.900]   and spending lots of time and stress to do so.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.440]   At this stage of the legal procedure,
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.360]   there is a possibility in some cases
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:49.160]   that a plaintiff can have a pre-judgment writ of attachment
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.460]   produced by the court,
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.600]   which will effectively freeze some of your assets.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.480]   This is not a tool that's available
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.480]   in all or even most cases.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.520]   It's available only, usually, in cases
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.880]   that are related to specific contracts,
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.560]   commercial contracts.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.600]   The claims need to be specific,
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.380]   and there needs to be a good ability
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.360]   for the plaintiff to show the judge,
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.520]   hey, there's a good chance, if this goes to trial,
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.360]   that I'm gonna win.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.240]   But in some cases, the judge will actually issue
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.880]   a pre-judgment writ of attachment,
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.040]   which will effectively freeze your assets.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.120]   If it's issued against real estate that you own,
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.960]   that real estate can't be sold or financed
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.020]   once that writ has been filed against it.
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.860]   If it's against money that you have in a bank account,
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.080]   that money can't be spent.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:39.920]   It can't be withdrawn.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.400]   It can't be moved.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.080]   So there is a legal judgment
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.580]   or a legal option available at this stage,
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.560]   but it would be more unusual, and it's not available
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.660]   unless somebody's alleging negligence against you.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.240]   Then we move into the discovery phase.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.880]   And the discovery phase of a lawsuit
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.640]   is where each side in a lawsuit,
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.920]   the plaintiff and the defendant,
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.600]   are able to try to probe one another,
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.200]   the information that each of them has,
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.120]   and build their various cases against one another.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.440]   And those cases come from asking questions of one another,
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.380]   interrogatories, written questions,
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:18.380]   comes from interviews and interrogations, depositions.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:23.020]   It comes for the request for production of documents.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.760]   And this can, depending on the lawyer and the strategies,
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.400]   can be used even part of a legal strategy.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.400]   For example, somebody may ask
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.280]   for so much information from you
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.080]   that they're just trying to bury you in work
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.840]   that you have to produce for them
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.360]   so that you might be inclined
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.400]   to make them a settlement offer early on
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.760]   to try to avoid the hassle.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.520]   Sometimes, however, these details
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.720]   are just simply a normal part
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.620]   of collecting the facts of the case.
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:53.320]   There are massive potential sources of information
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.240]   that an attorney could seek to exploit
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.280]   if they could demonstrate
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.080]   that it is connected to their case.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.240]   One of the defensive plans,
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.760]   I'll come back to defensive plans at a later date.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.680]   So this is the, later in the show,
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.500]   this is the discovery phase.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:17.000]   Then if the case is not settled before trial,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.800]   which of course many lawyers would seek to do,
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.080]   the case is not settled before trial
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.200]   and the case will go to the actual trial.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.360]   If the case goes to trial,
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.880]   then the facts of the case are tried
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.680]   and a verdict is reached.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.640]   If the verdict comes against you,
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.600]   then a judgment is produced by the court against you.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.600]   And the judgment legally authorizes your creditor,
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.920]   the person that you've lost the case against,
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.080]   now your creditor,
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:50.520]   your creditor to collect the money or the assets from you
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.720]   to satisfy the judgment
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.760]   and the amount that the court has awarded to them.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.800]   Now they've got to find your assets.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.860]   And at this point in time,
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.920]   you have one of the most powerful tools
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.520]   that a creditor can have,
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.560]   which is the ability to force you
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.120]   to take a debtors examination.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:12.120]   And in the beginning of the lawsuit process,
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.200]   the plaintiff has no legal ability
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.880]   to force you to say anything about your assets.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.480]   The attorney, as I said earlier,
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.680]   could hire a private investigator,
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.080]   but that private investigator has no legal ability
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.280]   to walk into your office and say,
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.140]   "How much money do you have and where is it?"
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.120]   They're looking through public records,
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.640]   they might be doing surveillance,
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.760]   they might go and search through
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.560]   to try to find what you own,
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.540]   they might have some underhanded and illegal methods,
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.640]   some sources at the banks
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.160]   to find out how much money you have in the bank, et cetera.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.160]   But at the end of the day,
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.240]   they don't have any legal tools against you.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.300]   But a debtors examination changes all that.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.360]   Because now you will be asked
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.600]   to make a list of all of your assets,
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.760]   to say what you own, where it is,
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.440]   how much it's worth in great detail.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.480]   You can also be asked
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.520]   if you've made any transfers of money,
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.640]   if you gave money away before the lawsuit
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.960]   at any point in time.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.960]   And a debtors examination is forced upon you under oath,
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.560]   where you have to give true and complete answers.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.700]   And if you fail to give true and complete answers
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.980]   to those questions,
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:25.560]   you run the risk of committing a felony offense,
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.800]   which is very, very serious.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.940]   So basically, you should always plan
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.500]   that in a debtors examination,
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.000]   you're always going to be listing everything that you own
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.040]   so as to avoid committing a felony.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.160]   Remember, here at Radical Personal Finance,
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.820]   we don't ever want to commit felonies
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.120]   because those limit our freedom significantly.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.280]   So I want you to live your life very carefully
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.320]   to avoid committing any felonies,
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.280]   and then understand how to conduct your life very carefully
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.440]   so that even any accusations of any felonies
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.640]   completely fall aside.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.040]   And it starts by telling the truth.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.160]   So in that debtors exam,
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.640]   then the creditor finds out about the assets.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.280]   And then at that point in time,
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.280]   then the court can actually issue a writ of execution,
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.120]   which authorizes the sheriff or whoever,
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.760]   the appropriate law enforcement authorities are
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.000]   to take possession of your properties.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.560]   They can force the sale of a house,
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.000]   they can seize assets from a bank,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.840]   they can seize physical property,
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.440]   the sheriff can come and collect certain physical property.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.320]   And then that property or money is turned over
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.280]   to the creditor to satisfy the judgment.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.640]   Now, there's some interesting texture
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.460]   that we could talk about all those topics more,
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.920]   but that's the basic process,
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.040]   the basic legal process that you will be subject to.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.720]   Now, let's briefly give an overview
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.480]   of some of the different strategies that will be involved
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:59.480]   in your overall asset protection planning.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.120]   The first thing that you want to be careful of
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.840]   is always be careful to be prudent in all of your conduct
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.920]   and all of your actions.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.520]   So you know, you need to always be careful
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.720]   to try to minimize anything that would give cause,
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.680]   give rise to a potential claim against you.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.320]   And then also to minimize anything
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.520]   that would give anybody a legal case against you.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.360]   So if you need to shovel the snow or salt
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.880]   or sand the sidewalk so it's not icy,
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.420]   go out and do it so that somebody doesn't come along
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.040]   and slip and fall, that's the right thing to do.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.760]   Don't text and drive, pay attention to your driving
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.320]   so you don't run into somebody at a stop sign.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.400]   Be prudent in all of your actions, be careful
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.540]   so that you can minimize the facts
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.600]   that occur in the first place.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.320]   In life, many of these things
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.200]   are just simple split-second decisions.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.240]   But if you'll take the careful decision,
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.120]   then you can minimize massive opportunities.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.000]   Let me just repeat, you know, texting and driving
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.600]   has about the same impact, my understanding
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.880]   of the data shows that it has about the same impact
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.800]   as drunk driving.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.440]   Now, very few of us would go and drunk drive,
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.440]   but how many of us are guilty of texting and driving?
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.680]   So just simply choose not to.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.600]   And that's a simple choice that you and I can do,
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.600]   but it's a simple choice that could have profound benefits,
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.480]   financial and otherwise.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.240]   I mean, just imagine the horror of running into somebody
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.880]   and killing somebody because you weren't paying attention.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.200]   Imagine the horror of that on your conscience,
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:40.300]   let alone the financial implications to your wealth.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:44.520]   So always be prudent, be prudent, be careful.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.320]   And if you'll implement a lifestyle of prudence
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.800]   and carefulness, then you can probably avoid
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.640]   many of the facts that might arise.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.480]   And then if those facts arise, you can put the strength
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.960]   of the evidence on your own side.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.760]   So that's the obvious first thing that you always
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.800]   have to consider before any facts occur,
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.120]   be prudent and be careful.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.720]   Now, what about at other stages of this process?
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.680]   It's good for you if possible to appear
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.080]   to be utterly financially bankrupt
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.380]   to the greatest extent possible.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.800]   Now, of course, this may affect some of the lessons
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.960]   you're trying to teach others,
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.720]   this may affect your standing in the community,
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.560]   but just simply from a kind of an extreme example,
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.640]   if you could simply appear to be bankrupt at all times,
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:41.000]   that would minimize your vulnerability.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.220]   So how could you do that?
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.080]   Well, we'll talk about some of those strategies.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.080]   We'll talk about things like equity stripping,
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.320]   where you strip equity out of visible assets
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.040]   and put it into invisible assets.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.520]   But that's one of the most important
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.000]   asset protection planning strategies
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.420]   is always equity stripping.
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.440]   But if you could just simply look bankrupt at all times,
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.800]   that would help to protect you from lawsuits
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.480]   because you eliminate massive numbers
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.960]   of potential plaintiffs.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.840]   You know, the attorney hires the private investigator,
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.680]   private investigator come back and says,
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.920]   "This dude doesn't have any money.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.520]   You know, he lives in this house,
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.000]   but the house has a giant mortgage on it.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.320]   He's spending money like crazy trying to impress
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.000]   all of his friends, he's totally bankrupt.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.320]   If he filed today, you wouldn't gain a thing against him."
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.960]   Well, that can avoid even many lawsuits being filed.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.920]   And it also puts the strength on your side as well
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.040]   of being able to protect yourself and just simply say,
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.520]   "Hey, I don't have a lot of assets."
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.840]   So you want to appear to be financially bankrupt
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.200]   to the greatest extent possible.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.400]   And you wanna have maximum privacy around your affairs.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.760]   Somebody could try to look into you and say,
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:47.600]   look into your money and say,
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.680]   "Well, I don't know, they might have money,
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.720]   but I sure can't find it."
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.760]   That also can be an effective strategy.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.520]   So that's kind of an extreme, extreme case.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.960]   Now, if assets are located, and again,
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.800]   remember, if you lose a lawsuit, if assets are located,
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   you want those assets to be totally unreachable by creditors.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.680]   Most common theory here is exemption planning.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.040]   So if you have money,
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.360]   but you have a million dollars in your 401k,
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.400]   and you have no other money,
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.040]   the creditor is not gonna be able to collect against that.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.720]   So kind of an ultimate perfect scenario
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.920]   is if assets are ever located,
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.520]   then you want them to be totally unattachable,
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.080]   unreachable by your creditors.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.200]   You can accomplish that with simple mundane things,
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.400]   exemption planning, homesteading a property,
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.160]   life insurance may be exempt in your state,
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.120]   annuity assets may be exempt in your state,
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.560]   your ERISA-governed qualified plans,
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.040]   your 401ks, 403bs may be exempt in your state,
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.320]   or it might be with very exotic,
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.800]   an offshore asset protection trust
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.240]   down on the Cook Islands.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.720]   So yes, you have money, but it's,
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.960]   again, it's in an offshore asset protection trust
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.840]   down on the Cook Islands,
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.160]   and that trustee is never, ever going to comply
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.200]   with the US courts, first and foremost.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.040]   If they wanna sue you,
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.120]   they gotta sue you in the Cook Islands,
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.160]   and the trustee's never gonna make a distribution.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.920]   So if assets are locatable,
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.520]   and something comes against you,
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.120]   then you want those assets to be utterly unreachable
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.160]   by your creditors.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.320]   And then finally, the next stage is,
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:33.000]   if assets are locatable and reachable,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.880]   attachable by your creditors,
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.160]   you want them to be toxic to those creditors.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.560]   So if possible, you want to,
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.080]   in very sophisticated asset protection planning,
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.520]   you wanna lay a trap to the creditors,
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.520]   where yes, they can have this LLC member interest
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.520]   that you own,
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.040]   they receive the interest,
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.640]   but you set a trap so that if they receive the interest
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.680]   in this foreign LLC,
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:05.040]   which is entangled with the trustee
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.400]   in your offshore trust,
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.480]   they receive the interest,
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.800]   but now the manager of that LLC
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.760]   chooses not to make distributions
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.760]   to that particular member
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.400]   because of what you've put in the LLC,
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.440]   and now you lay a trap
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.720]   so that the person has phantom income.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.080]   And so now your creditor
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.400]   is receiving an LLC member interest,
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.480]   and they're entitled to all the distributions,
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.320]   but the manager of the LLC is not making distributions
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.680]   to that particular LLC member,
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.800]   but now they are reporting to the IRS
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.840]   what that LLC member's share of the profits are,
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.320]   and so now your creditor owes a tax bill.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.760]   You can do that.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.120]   You can set it up so that if they own the LLC interest,
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.720]   then they receive the tax bill for phantom income.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.160]   They never received any income,
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.440]   but now they owe the IRS,
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.680]   and that can make that asset toxic to the creditor
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.560]   and can possibly persuade them
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.040]   to engage in a post-judgment settlement,
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.840]   where now you say, "Hey, listen,
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.360]   "you have this judgment here of a million dollars,
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.000]   "and you've got this LLC.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.840]   "You executed a charging order
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.080]   "against this member interest, and you own it,
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.400]   "but now you're getting a tax bill for $40,000 a year.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.080]   "Why don't we settle this, and I'll come up with,
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.680]   "and I'll pay you $300,000,
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.280]   "and then you surrender this judgment
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.120]   "that you have against me for a million dollars."
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.560]   And then you can possibly enter
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.560]   into post-judgment negotiations and settle your case.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.960]   So that's kind of a dream world
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.840]   if we had everything as perfect
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.720]   as I can personally imagine it to be.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.480]   Maybe you find that fun.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.840]   I always like to start with what's the perfect,
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.800]   and then how close can I get to that practically
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.560]   given my actual situation?
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.720]   But that is how you protect yourself.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.240]   Be cautious and prudent in your activities.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.880]   Appear to be financially bankrupt
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.440]   to the greatest extent possible,
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.080]   and/or have as much absolute privacy
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.520]   so that your financial assets are unlocatable.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.360]   If any assets are located,
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.800]   make sure they're unreachable by your creditors
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.360]   by carefully putting up firewalls
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.280]   between those assets and other assets,
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.360]   by carefully bringing in legal protection
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.400]   for those assets with various strategies.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.240]   If assets are reached ever,
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.840]   they're located, they're reached,
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.760]   then ultimately try to make sure
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.520]   that they're toxic to the creditors, if at all possible.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.360]   That will help you.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.400]   Two other points of defense,
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.760]   and then we'll close out today's show.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:28.760]   You wanna make sure that you at all times
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.640]   think carefully about your legal case as well,
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.240]   which is why you always want to be prudent in your affairs.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.240]   Make sure that you,
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:43.080]   if you are supposed to be doing something legally, do it.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.880]   If you're supposed to have good books and records
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.000]   for your corporation and take annual minutes, do that.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.800]   If you're supposed to have an annual meeting, do it.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.720]   Make sure that you actually properly manage something,
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.800]   because it would be stupid for you
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.400]   to go through all the work and hassle
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.680]   of setting up a well-run corporation,
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.520]   and then by commingling your assets,
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.480]   you give the judge everything they need to do,
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.960]   just simply pierce the corporate veil,
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.160]   and boom, everything falls apart.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.120]   So do the things that you need to do.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.960]   Legally protect yourself.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.800]   Don't keep around mountains and mountains of stuff.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   Don't keep around long histories
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.320]   and tens of thousands of emails.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.920]   If you're required legally in your industry
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.800]   to retain emails, great, but if not, get rid of that stuff.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.480]   Don't keep long records.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.920]   Don't keep messy computers with all kinds of stuff on those.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.720]   Keep your devices encrypted.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.320]   Make sure that you securely delete
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   and completely eliminate the files.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.360]   Don't create stuff that could cause problems
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.720]   for you in discovery, because you will hang yourself
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.640]   if you're not careful with that.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.000]   So make sure that you do that.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.800]   Keep your communications records cleared and purged.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.960]   There's no reason for you to have a year's worth
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.280]   of text messages with people.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.200]   There's no reason for all those things.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:01.720]   So think defensively and eliminate all of the stuff
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.960]   that could come against you in a legal trial.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.640]   That's always in your best interest,
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.080]   whether you're doing something wrong or not.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.840]   I'm not even, just do the right thing,
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.200]   but there's just no reason to maintain
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.680]   all these extensive files,
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.520]   and there's no reason to maintain them
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.320]   in a way that could sink you.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.560]   Just always imagine this.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.960]   Somebody walks in, whether it's a law enforcement official
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:28.960]   or whether it is a law enforcement official
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:33.240]   or a deposition, somebody walks in and says today,
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.040]   we are subpoenaing your, that's not the right word.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.520]   We're seizing your computer.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.840]   We're seizing your computer,
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.880]   and we're gonna do a forensic analysis of it.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.780]   We're gonna pull every file off of it.
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.080]   Could that cause you problems?
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.480]   If so, fix it today.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.040]   Or we're seizing your cell phone.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.080]   Could that cause you problems?
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.680]   If so, fix it today.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.200]   Some point, maybe I'll do a whole show on that,
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.640]   but it's one of the biggest weaknesses
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.800]   that most people have is we don't do a good job
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.280]   with controlling our data,
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.640]   but make yourself a tough opponent in a lawsuit.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.600]   Good asset protection planning
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.760]   will protect you at every phase,
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.560]   and that's why it's so important.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.800]   Be tough.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.820]   Put yourself in a tough situation
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.320]   so that you would be a very, very tough opponent.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:27.280]   By being tough, you can't eliminate the ultimate,
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.940]   if you do something very wrong
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.580]   and you have a very motivated person coming against you,
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.240]   you can't eliminate that.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.760]   But by putting yourself in the toughest situation,
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.160]   you can make most of the problems go away.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:43.060]   Just a very simple example from my own personal life.
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:48.060]   One of the benefits that I've always had in my entire life,
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.480]   and it's of none of my own doing,
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.200]   is I've always been a physically large person.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.760]   And when you are a physically large person,
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.240]   people don't mess with you.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.280]   I never was messed with in school
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.600]   because I was physically large.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.600]   Now, if you are a small person,
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.680]   you're gonna have to learn how to toughen yourself up
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.680]   and deal with that.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.560]   These are the cars that were dealt.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.320]   But I always observed that nobody ever messed with me
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.100]   because I was physically large.
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.160]   Now, we know that in terms of schoolyard bullying,
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.980]   but you can put the same thing in place
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.560]   for yourself in every stage,
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.220]   even just in terms of protecting yourself
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.520]   from physical attack.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.800]   If you look like a tough person,
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.960]   if you just walk like you know where you're going,
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.600]   all the simple things that we all know to do,
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.000]   when you're out walking on the street,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.440]   walk like you know where you're going.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.000]   Don't be paying attention.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.700]   If your head is up, your eyes are looking around,
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.100]   you will dissuade an attacker on the street
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:44.800]   because they just look at you and say,
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.900]   "Ah, there's somebody easier next door."
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.920]   Now, the same psychology applies
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.920]   in asset protection planning.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.920]   By being a tough person
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.640]   and having all of these things put in place,
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.340]   you will avoid most of the problems.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.920]   Remember, the vast majority,
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.920]   I think like 95% of lawsuits
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.800]   are probably settled out of court.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.480]   And so at every stage,
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.800]   you're dealing with just a psychological game
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.200]   of negotiation here.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:16.040]   And you're dealing with basically a negotiation
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.480]   and who's the tougher person with more to lose.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:23.320]   If you're very prudent and very careful,
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.920]   then you'll eliminate the facts
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.140]   that could bring somebody against you in the first place.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:32.140]   So if you don't allow in your company a sexualized culture,
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:36.440]   you eliminate the sexual harassment.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:41.440]   If you fire the employee who is acting out of turn,
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.040]   you eliminate the potential claim.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.020]   If you don't ever spend time
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.560]   with somebody of the opposite sex alone,
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.040]   you eliminate the entire case.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.280]   And so if you are prudent in those things,
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.680]   just going with a totally different area
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.140]   of civil litigation that happens all the time,
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.180]   if you are simply tough in that way
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.220]   and you create the right culture,
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.580]   you protect yourself.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:05.060]   If you clean the sidewalk,
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.220]   if you fix the gutter,
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.780]   if you cover over the old well,
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.380]   if you look for the potential risks
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.700]   and you fix those things,
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:14.340]   then you avoid the circumstances in the first place.
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.940]   Now, if circumstances occur
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:18.140]   or somebody thinks that circumstances occur
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.500]   or somebody feels that circumstances occur,
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.680]   by having all of your assets hidden and protected,
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.160]   then when that attorney does an asset search,
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.860]   they say, "Go back to the plaintiff and say,
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.440]   "I'm sorry, this guy doesn't have any money."
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.720]   Or if he does have money,
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.400]   "I don't know where it is."
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.900]   And they require more money from the plaintiff.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.000]   Well, most people don't go around with $30,000
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.440]   to give an upfront fee to an attorney.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.360]   And so you eliminate the lawsuits.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.640]   When the lawsuits come,
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.160]   by putting yourself in a maximally strong position,
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.560]   you can be very aggressive to settle it quickly
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.800]   and to settle it on your terms
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.920]   and to cause the opponent to cave as quickly as possible.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.520]   So, and then if ultimately you wind up going to trial,
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.800]   which is the minority,
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.680]   if you go to trial,
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.240]   you have the strongest case
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.000]   by doing all the things that we've talked about.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.620]   And then if you lose your case,
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:10.360]   then you wind up by,
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.040]   if you could put an asset in there
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.720]   that will ultimately be toxic for the creditor to hold,
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.240]   then you put in place what you need
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.320]   to even still be tough after the fact
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.880]   and to, and by isolating that,
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.760]   compartmentalizing that problem,
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.120]   the rest of your financial life should be humming along.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.280]   So it's not, you don't face wipe out risk.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.240]   That's the whole point along the way.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.140]   So I hope this is useful to you as a thought.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:40.880]   We'll get into more specifics coming forward in the future,
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.640]   but I hope this helps you to have a good understanding
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.480]   of the overall process of litigation.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.400]   I wanna encourage you and strengthen you to be tough
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.920]   and to get you to act now
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.240]   and to be tough so that you can be protected.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:57.240]   Remember, if you're wrong in something, you owe somebody,
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:00.200]   you can always take your money and go and pay it.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.680]   That should, I'm repeating it 'cause it needs to be said.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.600]   If you want to give somebody money,
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.120]   that's your prerogative.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.400]   But in all these kinds of things,
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.800]   you owe it to yourself and to your family,
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.080]   to your business to be in a tough situation
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.800]   by putting in place good planning.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.000]   That's it for today's show.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.080]   But in closing, I want to expand that theme
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.080]   for just a moment as I continue to market to you
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.160]   my most recent course,
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.680]   which is the "Radical Personal Finance Guide"
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.960]   on how to save money and borrow money safely
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.680]   using credit cards.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.320]   One of the reasons I created this course
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.200]   was because this was the type of planning
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.100]   that I didn't see people talking about
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:42.720]   as to how to be tough in your borrowing.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.660]   And it's simply, so it's simply using things
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:48.560]   like credit cards often instead of other forms of credit
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.200]   because they're unsecured loans.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.520]   And yet unsecured loans can be a wonderful benefit,
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.440]   but they can also be a very,
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:01.120]   they can be poorly managed.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.600]   And I've tried to give example again and again and again
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.760]   of how foolish it would be for you
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.180]   to take out a secured loan
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.000]   if you have the option for an unsecured loan.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.640]   Because with an unsecured loan,
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.280]   if you use that unsecured loan to buy property,
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.200]   you can always go and sell the property and pay the loan back
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.520]   but somebody can't force you to do that.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.800]   And in my observation of counseling people
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.280]   who are deep in credit card debt,
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.520]   and especially those who often wind up
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.720]   in very difficult circumstances,
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.080]   they never intended to be there in the first place.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.680]   They didn't think that they would get laid off.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.800]   They didn't think that when they were laid off,
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.480]   that their kid would get sick.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.360]   They didn't think that when their kid got sick,
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.560]   that their spouse would get cancer
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.260]   and they wouldn't be able to get reemployed.
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.360]   But yet one thing leads to another.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.720]   And so I always want you to think of maximum toughness,
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.280]   worst case scenario, what's the worst case scenario,
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.120]   and then position yourself for that.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.280]   And then usually if you do that, you never get there.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.880]   You never wind up having the problems.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.640]   My observation has been a little bit of care, prudence,
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.820]   investigation, thoughtfulness,
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.800]   and good forward-thinking action put in place
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.460]   in the beginning can save all kinds
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.740]   of potential problems down the road.
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:17.580]   That's the basis of financial planning.
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.860]   That's the basis of asset protection planning.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:23.100]   Frankly, that's the basis of most life planning.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:27.380]   Most of the problems that we face are of our own doing
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.440]   because we weren't prudent in the beginning.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.000]   Now, some things can be gotten out of some things
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.620]   you just deal with, that's life.
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:35.180]   But I wanna encourage you,
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:38.040]   even in your simple day-to-day financial transactions,
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.860]   with your credit cards, put things in place.
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.240]   Put the strategies that I teach you in the course in place
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.620]   so that you never miss a payment, ever.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.220]   So you're never a day late on a payment.
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.240]   So you keep your credit score very, very high
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.600]   'cause you never know when you need it.
