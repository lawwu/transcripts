[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.180]   - It's Friday.
[00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.460]   For a lot of us, our work week is coming to an end
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.740]   and the free weekend is ahead of us.
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.860]   For others, the weekend means more work,
[00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.100]   like for Christine, a nurse in Louisville.
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.420]   Dear Pastor John, thank you for your wisdom over the years.
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.220]   By God's grace, I've grown up in a solid Christian home
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.720]   and I have known your name
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.940]   as long as I have known my own name.
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.180]   Incredible.
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.340]   I recently graduated as a registered nurse
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.360]   and now work in an ICU that requires all nurses
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.860]   to work every third weekend on Saturdays and Sundays.
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.960]   Since I work day shift,
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.860]   this means that I miss being with the body of Christ
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.180]   every third Sunday for both the morning and evening.
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.300]   This is hard on me.
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.200]   I believe the Sabbath is a precious day of rest
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.740]   and refreshment in the Lord
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.060]   and in the company of his people.
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.860]   And yet I am thankful to have the opportunity
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.580]   to help bring physical healing on the Lord's day
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.380]   as our sweet Lord Jesus healed on the Sabbath.
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.780]   What wisdom could you give to us
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.700]   with jobs that require weekend work?
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.400]   - Well, the way Christine asked this question
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.520]   shows remarkable discernment, it seems,
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.680]   already into some of the New Testament teachings
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.200]   about the Lord's day.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.640]   She calls it a precious day of rest and refreshment
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.080]   in the Lord and in the company of his people.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.120]   That's a beautiful description.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.480]   And she draws the connection between work
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.960]   that blesses people on the Lord's day,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.400]   the way Jesus got himself in big trouble
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.400]   precisely because of healing people on the Jewish Sabbath.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.460]   And remember, I mean, Jesus rebuked the leaders
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.000]   by asking them this really amazing question.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.820]   Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.820]   or to do harm, to save life or to kill?
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.880]   I mean, what a question.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.160]   Is it lawful to kill?
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.000]   What in the world?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.180]   So here's what I think he's saying.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.180]   I think he's implying, if I don't do this good,
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.440]   it's like doing evil.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.080]   It's like killing.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.280]   That's amazing.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   You guys pull your beast out of the ditch on the Sabbath,
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.960]   how much more should a human being
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.720]   be pulled out of his disease?
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.720]   So let me build on what Christine has already clearly seen
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.800]   with just a few thoughts, maybe three.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.900]   One, ponder for a moment the term the Lord's day,
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.260]   the Lord's day and its implications.
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.260]   In the Old Testament, the Sabbath was marked on Saturday,
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.600]   the end of the week because God finished
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   the work of creation and rested on that day.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.480]   When Jesus rose from the dead,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.680]   he rose from the dead on the first day of the week,
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.600]   on Sunday, he was the first fruits of our resurrection.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.060]   He was a kind of inauguration of a new creation
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.120]   that's starting now and coming fully later.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.480]   So Christians already in the New Testament
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.240]   began to mark one day in seven,
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.440]   which they called the Lord's day,
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.960]   and they marked it on the first day of the week.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.000]   And that term, the Lord's day, Revelation 110,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.320]   was never used in the Old Testament for the Sabbath.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.060]   They could have called it Jesus day or Christ day
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.820]   or the Christian day,
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.160]   but they chose to call it the Lord's day, kurios.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.720]   Kurios, the Greek word for Lord,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.480]   also referred to the emperor, the king, the Caesar.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.120]   And so this is risky business.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.960]   Caesar has his day, we mark our Lord's day,
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   our emperor's day, once a week when he rose from the dead.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.440]   So one implication of this was,
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.680]   and I think still should be,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.520]   is that on that first day of the week,
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.480]   we mark worship of the kurios, worship of the Lord.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.360]   We bow before and reverence the Lord of Lords
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.720]   and the King of Kings on the first day of the week
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.780]   when he blasted the power of death
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.780]   and he overcame sin and he inaugurated the new heavens
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.920]   and the new earth and new creation
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.840]   with the resurrection of the dead.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.120]   We say by gathering in worship
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.560]   that he is worthy on that day, the Lord.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.760]   Not just Jesus, not just Christ,
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.400]   not just the Christian day, but the Lord's day.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.400]   And of course, they all began to do this
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.860]   when there were no Sunday laws.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.860]   I mean, everybody evidently was working
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.040]   because there hadn't been centuries of cultural influence
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.220]   by the church that could in any way
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.980]   cause a whole empire to turn things around and say,
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.820]   well, yeah, everybody gets a day off here now from now on.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.160]   That didn't happen for a long, long time.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.560]   And so the worship had to happen early in the morning
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.160]   on that day, late in the evening,
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.120]   and it looks like in Acts 27,
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.000]   where poor Eutychus fell out of the window,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.440]   that Paul extended his sermon until midnight.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.220]   So evidently they were gathering
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.120]   and worshiping in the evening.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.200]   So my first counsel would be that we all try,
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.160]   if possible, to worship with God's people
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.180]   on the Lord's day, early or late.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.240]   And I wonder, just in passing,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.240]   if churches that long ago gave up Sunday evening services
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.540]   might, in a day of awakening and refreshment,
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:05.440]   find a Sunday evening service useful and precious again,
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.080]   if they could get over the cultural compromise
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.420]   of everybody staying home
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.620]   and watching their favorite movie or TV show.
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.600]   Number two, here's my second observation.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.040]   I would say to those who must work on Sunday,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.040]   the principle of resting one day in seven is God's wisdom.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.240]   When we worship on the first day of the week,
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.200]   we say that Jesus is Lord.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.960]   When we rest one day in seven, whatever that is,
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.960]   when we rest one day in seven, we say, "I am not God."
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.740]   God is God.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.180]   He is the creator and sustainer of all things, not me.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.440]   I am a creature.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.260]   I need rest.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.120]   God does not need rest.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.320]   When he rested, it wasn't because he was tired
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.740]   or because he had to.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.640]   He was celebrating, marking the perfection of his work.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.640]   We mark that celebration as well.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.420]   And the truth that we are not God is a big part of it.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.040]   God can handle the world without my 24/7 help.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.620]   So whether that day is on Sunday
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.020]   or we take it some other day, for goodness sakes,
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.720]   you know, I was a pastor for 33 years
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.120]   and Sundays were certainly not my day of rest.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.500]   So I tried to honor that principle
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.620]   by taking another day to unwind.
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.220]   So here's my third observation or exhortation.
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.540]   I would say, seek as God makes it possible
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:46.500]   to gain as much freedom as you can for your Sundays.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.940]   Not because God demands, requires no work
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.700]   on Sundays of any kind,
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.740]   but so that you can have as much freedom as possible
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.980]   to make Sunday what you want it to be
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.980]   and not what others require you to make it.
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.740]   It's as if Paul in 1 Corinthians,
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.020]   I could paraphrase him when he was speaking to slaves,
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.780]   he said, "Serve faithfully in your position,
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.020]   "but if you can gain your freedom, gain it."
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.060]   And that's what I would say about having to work on Sunday.
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.460]   If you must, you must, but I would sure pray
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.780]   and work towards as much freedom as possible.
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.340]   So in summary, here are my three,
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.140]   I think there were three counsels.
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.580]   One, if at all possible, worship with God's people
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.480]   on the Lord's day, the day he rose from the dead, Sunday,
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.300]   first day of the week, to declare that he is risen
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.940]   and he's Lord of lords.
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.180]   Number two, if possible, use one day in seven
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.540]   to break your routine, unwind,
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.180]   not pursue vocational deadlines
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.460]   and acknowledge that God created the world
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.780]   and that you are not the creator,
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.140]   you're not the sustainer of this world,
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.140]   but are finite and you are thankful.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.500]   And third, seek to be employed in a way
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.620]   that gives you as much freedom as possible
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.260]   on the Lord's day.
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.540]   And let me add one more thing.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.540]   Tony, let me add one more thing that comes to mind.
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:22.140]   As you interact with people at work,
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.080]   in the neighborhood or anybody,
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.200]   talk about the Lord's day
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.520]   as you come to understand its riches.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.900]   Probably in the world, the only picture that people have
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.660]   of Sunday observance, whatever that might be,
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.620]   is a set of rules, mainly don'ts,
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.260]   and they don't have any idea what it means.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.340]   They don't have any idea.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.280]   And you could introduce them,
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.120]   as you just talk about what it means to you,
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.620]   to a whole new way of thinking about the Lord,
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.180]   about the Lord's day, which they've never heard.
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.660]   They may never even heard of that phrase.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.060]   You could introduce them to the resurrection.
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.540]   You could introduce them to the new creation.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.740]   You could introduce them to the Lordship of Christ
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.980]   over all lords.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.440]   You could introduce them to the first creation
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.660]   and its riches and your own sense of finiteness
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.740]   and need and dependence.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.820]   You could talk about trust in the Lord.
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.580]   And my guess is that in the early church,
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.860]   as this habit began to form over against
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.740]   Jewish Sabbath worship,
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.060]   it was inevitable and unavoidable
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.460]   that this topic would come up for conversation
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.060]   and probably was a great opportunity
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.020]   for bearing witness to Jesus is Lord.
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.940]   That's really good.
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.900]   And probably a family that gets dressed together
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.500]   and goes on Sunday mornings, drives off every morning,
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.980]   your neighbor's gonna notice that.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.500]   And it'd be good to talk to 'em
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.580]   and so they have some clearer sense of what are you doing?
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.020]   - Yes, exactly, that's a good word.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.460]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.940]   - Amen, but what about those of you
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.820]   who work seven days a week?
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.300]   There's another vocational question on the table
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.980]   that we need to address and we will next time
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.380]   in episode number 1390.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.880]   Well, whatever the span of your work week,
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.780]   thank you for listening along to the podcast
