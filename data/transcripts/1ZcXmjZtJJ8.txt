[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400]   Hi, and welcome to the video.
[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.820]   We're going to do something a little bit different today,
[00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.280]   and we're going to build a Python project from scratch.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.800]   And what I want to do is build a Plotly chart
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.000]   and feed stock information into this chart from the Alpha
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.320]   Vantage API, which is very similar to the Yahoo Finance
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.200]   API, as far as I am aware.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.400]   I haven't used either of them that much, to be honest.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.000]   But they seem to have pretty good documentation,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.800]   and it's a little bit different, and I just
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.880]   want to explore using this API rather than
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.440]   Yahoo Finance, which is like the de facto standard, almost.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.840]   So after we give some stock information to this chart,
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.360]   we want to actually chart it and plot a few interesting
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.160]   indicators.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.960]   So you can see on the screen, I've
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.880]   gone for a few different indicators here.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.040]   I haven't really seen any of these
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.480]   because I'm not a finance person,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.000]   so I don't claim to know what all of this means exactly.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.600]   Obviously, the simple moving average
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.440]   is a moving average of the stock price over time,
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.780]   so that one is quite simple.
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.440]   And I just want to include that in there
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.820]   so that we can see that we're actually doing things right
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.920]   and we're plotting these indicators correctly.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.600]   And then we have this thing called the onBalanceVolume,
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.480]   which measures positive and negative volume flow.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.680]   So the reason I'm including all this volume
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.800]   and balancing momentum-based indicators is at the moment
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.400]   in the stock market, we have the big Wall Street
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.200]   versus Wall Street bets.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.880]   And I want to use this opportunity
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.600]   to just build a cool project that at least gives
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.680]   a little bit of information on what is actually
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.920]   happening in terms of the actual stock market.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.580]   Now, a lot of these are traditional indicators.
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.080]   They've been around for a few years,
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.500]   so I don't know if they're actually
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.040]   going to be useful or not because, obviously,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.840]   the market conditions at the moment are not normal.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.240]   But it'll be interesting to see.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.860]   And then we have this balance of power,
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.840]   which is the market strength of buyers versus sellers.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.480]   So again, pretty relevant.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.600]   Rate of change, maybe we'll include this.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.520]   I'm not sure, this one called Arun, which looks
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.800]   quite interesting, actually.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:35.400]   So if we go on here, you can see that it essentially
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.480]   gives us this.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.800]   So we get a downtrend and uptrend indicator line.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.440]   And whenever these cross over, that's
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.640]   typically when you see an uptrend or downtrend.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.020]   And I think that'll be quite interesting to see as well.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.480]   And so this is based on the time between highs and lows
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.480]   in a specific time period.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.680]   So what you're doing here is measuring the lowest point,
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.840]   and that gives you the points, the edges,
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.480]   or the peeps and troughs of this indicator here.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.800]   So I think that'll be pretty interesting.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.720]   And then we have this Chaikin oscillator.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.840]   And I thought this would also be quite interesting,
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.640]   because this is tracking the strength of price movements
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.520]   and the underlying buying and selling pressure
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.480]   to estimate demand.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.240]   So that should also be pretty interesting.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.440]   So let's go ahead, and we're going to start coding this up.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.040]   So the first thing we need to do is figure out
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.160]   how to use the Alpha Vantage API.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.880]   So basically, all the data that we want, we can get from here.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.560]   So the main part of that is going to be this time series
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.840]   intraday API.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.400]   So we'll just go ahead and figure this out.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:28.560]   OK, so if we just take this, let's figure out
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.880]   the format that data is actually going to come in with.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:05:00.280]   OK, so we have our interval, which
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:08.200]   we included here, symbol.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.720]   We're going to change that to GME.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   And then we have this time series,
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.840]   which is in the dictionary.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.400]   And inside here, we have our open high, low, close,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.920]   and volume as well, which is interesting.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.080]   So OK, let's pull that together.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.200]   So first, I do want to have the candlestick format.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.120]   So I came up with this.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.920]   So candlestick is this, whereas if we were just
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.080]   tracking the average, it would look like this.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.400]   So first, we're just going to do this with Blightly.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.480]   And then we'll figure out how to build the candlestick.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.400]   So we're going to go ahead and try and build that.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.640]   So for now, we're just going to use this data.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.800]   And we'll get into a data frame.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:25.360]   So import pandas and just clean it up a little bit.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.280]   OK, so I'm going to initialize the data frame first.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.440]   And then we'll just loop through each of these entries.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.800]   We'll have the date and time in one column,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.920]   the open, high, low, close, and volume in other columns.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:25.000]   And we'll just append each one of these
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.360]   as we work through.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:53.160]   So here, we're just going to print out
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.320]   each of the date time keys.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.560]   Because here, we need to actually access this in order
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.480]   to get into our actual values here.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.480]   So just print this out.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:09.560]   And then we need to also add this.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.240]   There we go.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.960]   So these five minute intervals, and this
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.920]   is what we're going to work with.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.040]   Let's just make things a little bit easier to read.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:28.040]  , and now we're going to do here, we're going to do here, we're going to do here, we're going to do here.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.040]   Let's just make things a little bit easier to read.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:52.560]   And now, we're going to do here is append a dictionary, which
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.040]   is going to contain each one of these columns.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.360]   And now, we're going to do here is append a dictionary, which
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.840]   is going to contain each one of these columns.

[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.440]   And now, we're going to do here is append a dictionary, which

[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.440]   And now, we're going to do here is append a dictionary, which

[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.440]   And now, we're going to do here is append a dictionary, which
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.440]   is going to contain each one of these columns.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:43.440]   Let's do that.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:58.440]   Let's go with the open for now.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.440]   OK.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.440]   So you can see that it's not showing anything.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:07.440]   And this is an issue with one of the Plotly extensions.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:15.440]   OK.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.440]   So we just need to install those.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.440]   It's not difficult, though, from what I remember.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:41.440]   Yeah, this is Plotly extension.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.440]   So it's the JupyterLab extension.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.440]   So that's checking what we have.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:57.440]   OK.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.440]   So I need these two, JupyterLab extension--
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.440]   JupyterLab Plotly and Plotly widget.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:14.440]   So let's go and install those two.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.440]   I realize maybe this is too small for you to see.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.440]   So these two are going to do.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.440]   Although these are the uninstallable,
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.440]   we're going to install them.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.440]   All right.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.440]   OK.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:55.440]   OK.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:10.440]   So then we need to install the other one as well.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.440]   Then we might need to restart Jupyter,
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.440]   but let's see if it works.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.440]   I'm also going to need a JupyterLab build as well,
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.440]   just in case I need it.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:43.440]   I don't think I will, but let's try.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.440]   OK.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.440]   So let's go back to our lab.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.440]   And let's just refresh and try.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.440]   Let's see if it works.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:56.440]   If not, we'll just restart.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.440]   Yeah, OK.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:26.440]   So let's just restart it quickly.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.440]   And let's try all this again.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.440]   Here we go.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.440]   So it's working now.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.440]   So yeah, that's pretty cool.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.440]   Although, what is this?
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:45.440]   We have-- yeah, that's weird.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:52.440]   Do we need to-- let me check what these are.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.440]   I assume these must be strings.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:22:09.440]   They're not actual numbers.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:18.440]   Yeah, so we need to convert these into numbers as well.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:26.440]   OK, so we can do that with the two numeric function.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.440]   And then just pass the columns that we want in there.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.440]   I'm not sure if we can do all of them at once
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.440]   or if we have to do one at a time.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:49.440]   Let's try all.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.440]   OK, yeah, so just one at a time.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:23:10.440]   Let's just take this list.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.440]   I'm also not sure if it does it in place or not as well.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   Let's just have a quick look.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.440]   OK, so I think it does not do it in place.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:47.440]   Let's see.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:24:11.440]   OK, so-- OK, so no, it doesn't.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.440]   All right, there we go.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.440]   So now it's a float.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.440]   This should work now.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.440]   There we go.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   So that looks pretty cool.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:27.440]   And we have this sort of interactive--
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.440]   interactivity with the chart, which-- this
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.440]   is why I wanted to use Plotly over, like, Matplotlib.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.440]   I think this is definitely something
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.440]   we want to have in the chart.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.440]   So we have that now.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.440]   Before we do the candlesticks, let's just
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.440]   try putting on a few of the indicators
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.440]   and see how that looks and see if they're
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.440]   straightforward or not.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:58.440]   So it is simple moving average.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.440]   So let's add that in.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.440]   Add that in.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:31.440]   OK, so let's just clean this API requesting up a little bit.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.440]   OK, so that is our API.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.440]   And then we just want to change these.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:06.440]   We'll just use it like this instead.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:24.440]   OK, so we have SMA.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:29.440]   We want GME weekly interval.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.440]   No, we want-- so five minutes.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.440]   Oh, no, we don't.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.440]   We want-- so it's a moving average.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.440]   So yeah, let's go weekly.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.440]   And see how that looks.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:45.440]   Time period, this is like 10 days.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.440]   What do we have here?
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.440]   We don't have a time period.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.440]   So we do want to adjust that a little bit.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.440]   So maybe we can--
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.440]   let me zoom in a little bit here.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.440]   Probably can't see anything.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:07.440]   So the function interval, so yeah, we have a few.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.440]   Let's go like a 60 minute, because then we can actually
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.440]   see that on the time period that we're already looking at.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.440]   Number of data points.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:26.440]   But OK, let's change this to a 60 minute moving average.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.440]   So no, we don't want to change that one.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.440]   We change this one.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:44.440]   And add in the API key as well.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:50.440]   OK, let's just see what we get.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:55.440]   OK, cool.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.440]   So we have this--
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.440]   OK, we have this technical analysis.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.440]   Interval, OK.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.440]   So we want to pulling data out of here.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.440]   OK, cool.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:15.440]   So I wonder if you can add multiple functions.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.440]   I don't know.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.440]   But let's stick with this.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.440]   And we're basically going to do the same thing again,
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.440]   where we take these.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:39.440]   But this time, we are getting our moving average.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.440]   So technical analysis.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:48.440]   Let's put this in.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:58.440]   And all we want here is the date time and then this SMA value.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:07.440]   So technical analysis, I think that's fine.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:13.440]   So now we just change this to SMA.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:19.440]   I think that should be OK.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.440]   Let's see.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:30.440]   OK, let's put that in here so I don't do that again.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.440]   And I just overwrote all of that.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:40.440]   I mean, I need to change this.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.440]   [TYPING SOUNDS]
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:30:04.940]   OK.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.440]   OK, that looks cool.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   So we will also need to do this again, where
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.440]   we convert it to numeric.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.440]   [TYPING SOUNDS]
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:42.440]   Let's just add SMA head here.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.440]   [TYPING SOUNDS]
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:56.440]   Then let's plot this.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.440]   And let's just see what we get.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.440]   [TYPING SOUNDS]
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:09.440]   OK.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.440]   So we get a lot more data here.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:20.440]   So we need to restrict that to only within what we have here.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:25.440]   But at the same time, I think it would be cool
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.440]   if we got a little more data than what we have.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.440]   But let's just keep it dynamic for now.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:37.440]   So we just take the minimum date time that we have within DF.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.440]   And then we'll just apply that to all of our technical indicators
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.440]   so that we're only pulling it from then onwards.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.440]   And we could probably get it from the API.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.440]   But let's just filter the data frame.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.440]   Yeah, because here, I'm not sure they do actually give you
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:13.440]   a date time limit that you can just extract from that point.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.440]   So yeah, I think we need to do it from the data frame anyway.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:35.440]   So after we do all of this, let's also get the min date time.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:44.440]   That would just be DF date time dot min.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:33:00.440]   We also need to re-extract all of that because I overwrote it earlier.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.440]   Okay, and then let's check our date time.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.440]   It should be something reasonable.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.440]   So yeah, I think that makes sense.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.440]   It's like 12 hours before.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:29.440]   No, about eight hours before this point.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.440]   So that's fine.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.440]   So eight hours of data in there.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:41.440]   So when we do this, all we need to do is just filter out anything
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:45.440]   that is below that date time.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:56.440]   So all we do is SMA equals SMA,
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:03.440]   where the date time is greater than or equal to minDT.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.440]   So let's just check.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.440]   So we have the length of SMA here.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.440]   So we've got 560 rows.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.440]   And then if we do this, we filter it down to nine,
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.440]   which is more reasonable.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:26.440]   So we have, I think we had around eight hours in there.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.440]   So nine hours maybe.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.440]   And we're taking it in 60 minute intervals.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.440]   So that makes sense.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:42.440]   And then if we do that, cool.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.440]   So we get our SMA indicator here.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:52.440]   So let's plot those both together and see how it looks.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:09.440]   Okay, so apparently you need to also add fig,
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.440]   add scatter.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:22.440]   And then you add mode lines onto the end to add another line.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:47.440]   So maybe I didn't see this.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:36:06.440]   Okay, so line is supposed to be lines, I think.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.440]   Okay, cool.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.440]   So that looks good.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:21.440]   We have our SMA and our actual plot.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.440]   So that seems pretty straightforward.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.440]   But now we actually want to maybe add candlesticks into this
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:35.440]   because that would be pretty cool in my opinion.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.440]   No idea how we can do that in Plotly.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   So let's try and figure it out.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.440]   It actually looks really simple.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:26.440]   So you need to use the graph objects instead of express.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:31.440]   Let's try and add that then.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:37.440]   So if it's really that easy, then this -- oh, it's super easy.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:38:02.440]   Oh, wow.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.440]   Okay, so that's our candlestick.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:12.440]   That's really cool.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:18.440]   I don't really know if you want this bit, but I suppose it's kind of cool.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.440]   Let's just go with it for now.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:32.440]   So we have that and then we also want to add scatter again to add the SMA.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:46.440]   Okay, that's pretty cool.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:51.440]   So now we just want to add in a few of those other indicators.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.440]   So what do we have?
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:39:02.440]   We have this OnBalanceVolume, BalanceOfPower, RateOfChange, Arun, and Trikin.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.440]   So let's do this OnBalanceVolume one first.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:11.440]   I'm going to add in a couple of functions to actually do things as well.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   So like here, every time that we want to convert these to numeric,
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:24.440]   I think we want to convert anything that's just not called date/time.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:50.440]   So we can just add that as a function.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:58.440]   Let's do toNumeric and then just add our DataFrame.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:06.440]   Then we just go for col in df.columns.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:16.440]   We only want to do this if col is not equal to date/time.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:22.440]   So every other column we do want to convert to numeric.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:26.440]   And just return that.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.440]   Okay, so instead of needing to write it out every time,
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:48.440]   we can just write toNumeric when we have our data.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:41:13.440]   Okay.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:23.440]   So here we're getting the time series data.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:34.440]   We also want to convert to numeric here.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:43.440]   We can leave it as df.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:48.440]   Okay, and let's just test that, see how it is.
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:55.440]   Okay, looks good.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.440]   So we can remove that.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:14.440]   And then we are getting our SMA data.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:23.440]   So let's just move that into OneBox as well.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:44.440]   And this, we just want SMA and SMA.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:47.440]   Okay.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:57.440]   Let's move this up to the top as well.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.440]   I want to add in a few more here.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.440]   So we have -- which one is it?
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:11.440]   It's the onBalance, I think.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:24.440]   Yeah, the onBalance volume, let's do that one.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:27.440]   And we're probably going to do something similar here again, right?
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:37.440]   So let's go to our documentation and let's get the onBalance.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.440]   Obv.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:52.440]   So we have this.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:58.440]   So paste that there.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:05.440]   Do something pretty similar again.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:13.440]   So we have the API key, which is going to be our key.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.440]   The interval.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:38.440]   I should probably check what that actually means for this.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:45.440]   So this one is probably the one that I was most interested in seeing.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:52.440]   It's like a -- it measures the positive and negative flow with the intention of
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:45:01.440]   identifying where you've got a load of sort of big investors putting a lot of
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:08.440]   money into it.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:12.440]   Or sorry, when you've got a lot of smaller investors putting a lot of money
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.440]   into it, so basically the volume is higher.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:22.440]   Because obviously the retail investors are putting a lot more bets on, but
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:27.440]   they're smaller buys or sells.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:40.440]   So that I imagine would be how this works.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.440]   Although, you know, I've just read this very briefly before, so it could be
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.440]   completely wrong.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:50.440]   But it sounds pretty interesting from reading this.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.440]   So let's just try and implement it.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:46:01.440]   I'm going to go with shorter time period than what it's suggesting here.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.440]   Because I don't know if we will see anything with that.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:09.440]   Or the shorter interval, sorry.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.440]   And then GME.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:25.440]   Okay, so let's put this in.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:40.440]   No need to see what we actually get here.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.440]   Okay, so we have this technical analysis.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:49.440]   And it's basically the same as before when we had the SMA.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:55.440]   So we could probably write a function that does that for us.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:04.440]   But let's just do it like this for now.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.440]   So we just change this to ABV.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:29.440]   That's a pretty easy change.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.440]   Okay.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:41.440]   So let's try that.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:47.440]   I think this one should be pretty interesting to see.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:53.440]   And I don't know, to be honest, we're going to need to put these on another chart.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.440]   Because obviously that isn't going to work.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:02.440]   I imagine there isn't an easy way of doing it.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:07.440]   But let's just check quickly.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:18.440]   Okay.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:47.440]   So we should probably have a look at how people normally do this.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:49:14.440]   Okay, and let's try and stick with the graph objects.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:33.440]   So I don't know if this is going to give us -- yeah, this just gives us express.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.440]   Okay.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.440]   So we're actually just going to use a scatter.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.440]   Okay, cool.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:51.440]   So we want something like this.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.440]   We go scatter.
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:50:23.440]   And then we add X and Y.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:35.440]   Okay, so we just swapped out ABV.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.440]   Okay, cool.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.440]   So we have this.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:48.440]   Interesting.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:55.440]   So this is our unbalanced value.
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:56.440]   Is that right?
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.440]   Unbalanced volume, sorry.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:22.440]   So I wonder if this would make more sense because it's volume to have it as a bar chart at the bottom.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:50.440]   Yeah, that would be interesting, I think.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:52:15.440]   Okay.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.440]   So we have subplots here.
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:24.440]   We have space very similar to -- okay, perfect.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:28.440]   So that looks kind of good.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:32.440]   But we want steps, so I think it's the same as far as I know.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:39.440]   The only thing that I'm not doing here is matching on the X-axis.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:47.440]   But again, that shouldn't really be an issue for us because we do actually have -- we have already matched on the X-axis.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:53:00.440]   So let's give that a go.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:05.440]   So we want subplots, make.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:19.440]   And we append trace this time instead.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:32.440]   So this time we're going to append trace.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:37.440]   I don't know if we can add scatter.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:54.440]   Okay, no, so we need to -- yeah, I don't know if we should have really been doing that anyway because it needs to be more like this.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:58.440]   And then I suppose we can add mode here.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:04.440]   Or maybe not, let's not for now.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:08.440]   Let's just append trace.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:22.440]   And we do that for SMA as well.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:27.440]   Let's see how that goes.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:31.440]   I just want two rows.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.440]   And we've already imported this.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:41.440]   So let's -- okay, so we have data, Y.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:45.440]   Okay.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:55:06.440]   And we also need to specify the row and the column as well.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:10.440]   Okay, so this is going to be row -- which one?
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.440]   Yeah, this one's going to be row two.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:20.440]   This one here will be row one, col1.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:27.440]   And we just need to remove the data part that we added in here.
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:36.440]   So I suppose -- yeah.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:40.440]   So append trace.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:57.440]   And we just remove that.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.440]   Okay.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.440]   So yeah, it's pretty messy.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:05.440]   Okay, so it's because we have this.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:25.440]   So I kind of want to just get rid of that for now.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:37.440]   So I don't know what it is, like an excited slider maybe.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:42.440]   Okay, so this is kind of what we need, I think.
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:55.440]   So we just need to update the layout.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:57:03.440]   And just made this false.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:10.440]   And I think -- let's put this up to here.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:14.440]   Type date, okay, this should work.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:34.440]   Let's see.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.440]   Okay, cool.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:42.440]   So we have -- so now we have this.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:45.440]   What is it most useful?
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:58:00.440]   How do you normally -- let's have a look at how this unbalance volume is normally plotted.
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:13.440]   Okay.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.440]   So this is the unbalance volume here.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:25.440]   So it's just like another line chart underneath the other line chart.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:32.440]   So it's basically what we have already.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:38.440]   This is interesting.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:51.440]   So here's like a confirming trade when they're both in the same direction.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:56.440]   Okay, so this is what we want to look at here.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:04.440]   When the price and OBV are making higher peaks and higher troughs, upward trend is likely to continue.
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:12.440]   So when they're both going up, when they're making lower and lower, there's a downward trend.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:20.440]   If the OBV is rising, accumulation may be taking place.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.440]   So if we have a look at this.
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.440]   So you can see they're both going down.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:30.440]   So that's like, okay, the downward trend is likely to continue.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:33.440]   And here they're both going up.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:35.440]   So upward trend is likely to continue.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.440]   And then they're just leveling out here.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.440]   So it's not really anything of interest.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.440]   But I suppose here it's kind of balanced.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:50.440]   And we see the momentum sort of pushing up again just before it rises.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:54.440]   So maybe that is what we're sort of looking for.
[00:59:54.440 --> 01:00:08.440]   Either way, it's pretty interesting to actually look at.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:14.440]   And then I also want to probably have a look at this shaking osculator as well.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:20.440]   So it looks pretty interesting, I think.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:35.440]   So if we go back into the API documentation.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:40.440]   So I think it's this one.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:51.440]   So it's the Chaikin AD line.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:55.440]   Okay, so this is measuring big investors, I think.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:03.440]   So when you're looking for where the big investors are putting their money,
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:09.440]   this is supposed to be an indicator of it, as far as I understand.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:14.440]   So it examines the strength of price moves and the underlying buying and selling pressure
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:19.440]   to try and measure the demand.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.440]   Then divergence between the price and the oscillator is indicated as most frequent single
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.440]   and flags a short-term reverse on price.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:40.440]   So that'd be interesting to see if we can maybe find that happening around here or around here.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:02:09.440]   So let's figure that one out as well.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:37.440]   Okay.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:45.440]   So this time, we're just replacing the function with AD interval, this one's doing daily.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:56.440]   So maybe this is the sort of thing we want to be looking at more frequently.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:03.440]   So you have the key, GME.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.440]   And I think that's pretty much what we want.
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:12.440]   So let's put this down to, let's go 60 minutes again.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:22.440]   And then we can maybe change that.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.440]   Okay, so let's see what we get.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.440]   So this is Chaikin AD.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:35.440]   Okay, cool.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:39.440]   So let's pull that through.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:43.440]   So I'm going to use this code again.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:49.440]   So replace this.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:04:06.440]   I'm just going to call it AD or just call it Chad, Chaikin AD.
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.440]   Okay.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.440]   And what was it?
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.440]   Just Chaikin AD, right?
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:26.440]   So that's what we want.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:30.440]   Let's replace this with Chaikin AD again.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:42.440]   And add Chad down here as well.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:52.440]   Okay.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:05:00.440]   So I think, so this bit we need, what do we want this bit to be?
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:08.440]   So just Chaikin AD.
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.440]   Okay.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.440]   We've got two numeric, so that all looks pretty good to me.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.440]   Let's add that in.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:22.440]   So obviously that's going to need another row.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:28.440]   So let's just add that in.
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:44.440]   Add Chad.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.440]   And we'll put this at the bottom.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:53.440]   We need to add another row here.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.440]   Let's see how that looks.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:01.440]   So, okay, cool.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:02.440]   Doesn't look bad.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.440]   It's interesting.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:09.440]   So the point was that when they diverge,
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:19.440]   it's an indication of a sort of a movement change.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.440]   And that indicates a reversal in price.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.440]   So I don't know, I suppose here is like the only bit where it kind of doesn't
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.440]   follow the price because the price is pretty level.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:33.440]   In fact, it's even going down here, right?
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:39.440]   And here it starts to go up.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:44.440]   So maybe that's indicating the reversal in price change.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:48.440]   But it's also kind of difficult too because we're only looking at our time
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:54.440]   here, so we should probably increase the, you know, how much we're reviewing.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:07:02.440]   So let's just go to like 10 minutes and see how that looks.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:09.440]   Okay, I bet we can't do that.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:15.440]   Yeah, it's not returning anything.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.440]   It's probably the interval.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.440]   Oh, you see.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:22.440]   Okay, so we need 15 minutes.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:35.440]   Let's just go five, see what it's like.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:41.440]   Okay, so that's more interesting.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:48.440]   So now we just see like this big movement up here.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:53.440]   But then I bet if we look at long term, it's probably pretty stable.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:08:04.440]   So let's try and increase how much data we're actually looking at.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:33.440]   So the interval.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:47.440]   Okay, so what's our MNDT?
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:54.440]   Okay, so this is returning.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.440]   Okay, so this is actually returning Friday.
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.440]   So I was wrong earlier when I said this is a Saturday's data.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:09.440]   It's kind of stupid.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:24.440]   But does this actually return us anything more than what we have here?
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.440]   Okay, cool.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:30.440]   So we're showing this full rather than compact.
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:48.440]   So output size is going to be full.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.440]   So that should give us a lot more data.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:55.440]   So before we were heading at 11 on the 29th.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.440]   Let's see what we have now.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.440]   Okay, that's way further back.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.440]   So that's cool.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:07.440]   We probably, I don't know if we'll be able to even see that much though.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:14.440]   So maybe it's worth maybe not doing a five minute interval as we're going.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:19.440]   Like daily.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:26.440]   Let's see what that looks like.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:46.440]   Of course that changes this as well.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:53.440]   So let's change it here.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:56.440]   Hopefully that should work.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.440]   Okay, now.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:19.440]   So let's check what we are returning.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:24.440]   Okay, so how because we are doing the intraday.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:30.440]   We can go 60 minutes.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:49.440]   So let's change that to 60 minutes.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.440]   Okay.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:54.440]   Oh, no goes even further back.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.440]   I wasn't expecting that.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.440]   That's pretty good.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:03.440]   That's a lot of data.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.440]   So now I'm thinking, what do we want here?
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:10.440]   Maybe daily?
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:16.440]   Do we want daily?
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:23.440]   Let's go weekly for now.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:47.440]   Or maybe we can go daily.
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:51.440]   So let's have a look at these, how they are now.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:55.440]   So here's obviously the volume.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.440]   It's pushing up loads and everyone's buying into it.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:02.440]   But you can see there's this massive increase here.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:11.440]   This is back in at the start of January.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.440]   So start of January.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.440]   And yet it was going up but not loads.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:22.440]   You can just see it kind of pushing up, pushing up.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.440]   And then here you have same again.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.440]   It starts to go a little bit crazy.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.440]   So here went over, went greater than zero.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.440]   And this is January 22nd.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:41.440]   So here.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.440]   This is before it all went crazy.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:51.440]   So I think it kind of went down here and then back up.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.440]   Let's see.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:00.440]   It's pretty interesting.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:05.440]   So, I mean, I think that's it for this video for now.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.440]   It's probably, I mean, obviously there's a lot we could do like tidying up.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:15.440]   But just in getting a few indicators together and the actual stock data in Candlestick.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.440]   So it's pretty easy.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:23.440]   I mean, I've never done most of this before with Plotly and it's super easy to figure out.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.440]   So that's pretty good.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.440]   So I suppose that's it.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:30.440]   So thank you for watching the video.
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.440]   I'll leave all this code on GitHub as well.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.440]   I'll add a link in the description if it helps.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.440]   I mean, it's not too much anyway.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:44.440]   But it might help you pull things together a bit quicker.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.440]   So, anyway, thank you for watching.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:50.440]   And I will see you again next time.
