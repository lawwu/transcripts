[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:25.280]   little game. Humor me for just a moment. Do you have a rent payment or a mortgage payment?
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.360]   What would your life be like if you didn't have that? And even better,
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.680]   think what your life would be like if you had never had one. Never. Right from the beginning.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.880]   First house you ever lived in was a house you paid cash for.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.800]   I'm not talking about doing it at the age of 45, but at the age of 23?
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:14.160]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets. Today on the show,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.400]   we're going to be talking with a man who's the father of eight children
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.800]   and his three oldest have all purchased their own houses for cash while in their early 20s
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.400]   before they got married. That'd be a conversation worth listening to, right?
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:46.800]   I first heard about today's author when somebody had sent me a link to his book. He wrote a book
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.880]   called Buying a House Debt-Free. The author's name is Steve Maxwell. He and his wife, Terry,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.600]   they're Christians. They run a Christian ministry, essentially working with people trying to provide
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.400]   some practical instruction and advice on the daily practicalities of life. I saw this book and I
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.720]   bought this book called Buying a House Debt-Free. I was blown away by the stories in the book.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.080]   I think you're really going to enjoy today's show. A lot of times, I firmly believe that
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.000]   you can't judge somebody. You can't criticize somebody. You can't bring an ad hominem attack
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.800]   and say, "Just because you haven't done something doesn't invalidate ideas." Ideas should be judged
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.400]   on their merit based upon logic. There are some ideas where we have good ideas, but if there's no
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.040]   one that's actually done it, then the idea doesn't have nearly as much power as you wish it would
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:48.240]   have. My guest today, Steve Maxwell, he certainly has the clout behind his ideas. He has been a
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.920]   consistent man and it's really, really neat to read the story of how he's worked with his sons
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.200]   to help them to buy their houses debt-free. Again, all of his sons are on track to buy
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.480]   their houses debt-free. The three oldest have already done it and the younger two are on the
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.240]   way saving for it. So it's going to be a great interview. I think you'll really enjoy it.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.040]   Sometimes I listen to interviews like this and I think, "Man, I missed it. I totally missed it
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.400]   when I was younger." But I have an opportunity with my children. At the moment, we just have
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.680]   one. We're hoping for more, but with my son at least to hopefully shape his life in a different
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.720]   direction. I am totally inspired by the content of today's interview and by this book. A couple
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.320]   of quick summaries. In just a moment, I'm going to play the interview for you. Interviews with
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.800]   authors are always a little bit tricky because when somebody's written an entire book, they can't
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.880]   summarize a book in an interview. So an interview tends to be less about, "Here's the outline of the
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.280]   book and the lessons of it." The beginning of the interview is fairly chatty in the sense of just
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.840]   Steve telling his story. It's really fun to hear the individual stories of how his sons found and
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.920]   purchased their houses. The experiences range from smaller price tags to larger price tags,
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.720]   from fixer-uppers to very nice fancy houses. So the beginning of that and then we get into a little
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.360]   bit of his philosophy and then some practical tools. I will come back at the end of the
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:23.680]   interview and share with you a couple of the actual ideas from the book. It's a great book.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.400]   It's well worth your time and your energy. But it's hard to get an author to say, "Here's the
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.000]   outline of what I want to do," because they want you to read their book. So I want you to read his
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.760]   book as well, but I will come back at the end and summarize a few of the very practical ideas that
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.600]   he implements and talks about in the book. A couple of quick announcements. For those of you
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.960]   who are listening to me on iTunes or who have been subscribed in iTunes and are wondering where I went,
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.880]   still make sure I broke the iTunes feed and deleted all my iTunes subscribers a couple weeks ago. So
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.920]   I think this will be about the last time I'll mention it. But please, if you're not receiving

[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:24.240]   I would love to hear from you. I've learned my lesson about not building out further
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.880]   connections and newsletters and things like that. A lot of exciting changes coming in the show.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.040]   I'll mention a couple of them at the end of the show today. I'm working hard to ramp up the
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.200]   professionalism of the show, working hard to build up the content. I'll mention a couple of those
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.720]   things at the end of the day and kind of share with you the plans for December and the new year.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.640]   But for now, here's Steve.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.120]   So Steve, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I appreciate your making
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.280]   time to be with me today. Well, I am delighted to be with you, Joshua.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:03.360]   I'd like to invite you to share your story, but as introduction, I am going to read back to you
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.040]   the first three paragraphs of the preface of your book, because I thought this was an amazing preface
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.080]   to a book. And when I first read it, it was very interesting. And then I'd like you to share
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.520]   the backstory, behind your story with your family. So the first three paragraphs of your book say
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.680]   this, "Three of our sons have purchased their homes debt-free with cash before they were married.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.400]   As we write, our two younger sons are working toward that goal. It's not rocket science,
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.760]   and it's certainly not impossible to achieve the goal of owning a home debt-free while still in
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.840]   one's twenties. Simply put, it is a way of life. Some suppose that our sons had certain special
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.560]   advantages that enabled them to buy their homes debt-free, and that not everyone has those
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.120]   advantages. Our sons had no special advantages or circumstances, but only a vision set before
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.640]   them of hard work in their own business, denial of self-gratification, and a mindset for saving
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.960]   money. Plus, they experienced the blessing of the Lord. We believe that most young men are capable
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.160]   of beginning married life, owning their first home debt-free. And we believe that after reading
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.920]   Buying a House Debt-Free, you will agree with us. We have seen that it isn't a matter of whether
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.960]   they will fail in this quest, but whether they will choose to go for it with a serious level
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.920]   of commitment. You will be encouraged as you see your sons rise to a new purpose in life."
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:33.680]   This is a totally amazing introduction to a book. And yet, to the best of my knowledge,
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.400]   it's actually true. How on earth did you do that? And what's the story behind it?
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:45.760]   Oh, listen, I'm just smiling. I was enjoying every bit of what you're reading, because
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:55.840]   it isn't hard. This is what's so shocking. I think today people have been so
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   mesmerized by the current way of life that practical things are just seen as hard to
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:14.000]   believe, and they don't understand. And so, Nathan was the first, and I think he was 24
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:24.480]   when he bought his house. But he'd been saving for, oh, really probably since, seriously, around
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:31.920]   1819. And by the way, tell me when you want me to drill down a little bit on some of the detail.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:42.800]   And it was really, it was just a very natural thing when the widow's son across the street
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.640]   came over and just said, "We understand. We befriended them. We understand that Nathan
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:54.720]   might be interested in the house. And so we're going to sell it. Mom's going to be moving. And
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:03.280]   so are you interested?" But what was really fascinating about that is, first, Nathan came,
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:11.680]   Nathan was talking to him and told him, yes, he was interested. And the son said he would
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.960]   come back and have the house appraised and give Nathan a price without a realtor, so there'd be
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:23.360]   some savings there. And so Nathan told him he was very much interested. He came back with a price
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:31.520]   and about a week later or so, something like that. And what was really very fascinating is
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:40.160]   the price was about $10,000 more than Nathan had in the bank. And Nathan at that point said,
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.880]   when he told him the price, he said, "Great. Thank you very much. And I'll get back to you
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:51.840]   and let you know if I want to get it." He could have said, "Listen, I don't have the money.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:10:01.920]   And I'm sorry. I'm committed to not borrowing." But he said he didn't say that. And so then he
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:09.840]   went, we just talked about it a little bit and he started praying about it, what the Lord would
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:20.000]   have him to do. And then I meet with the guys weekly and I remember the meeting, that meeting.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.760]   And I said, "So Nathan, has the Lord shown you anything?" "No, no, he's not shown me anything."
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:35.600]   And then I think the next one, it was, and so you, "Has the Lord showed you anything?" And he said,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.000]   "Well, yeah, Dad, the Lord said to get it." Now at this point, he still didn't have the money,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.240]   the remaining balance. And I thought, "Well, okay, this is very interesting." And then he
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:52.560]   went on to say, "And Lord's also telling me it's time to get married." So that was a shock. We were,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:59.600]   "Wow, okay. Did he say who?" "Well, no, not who yet." And obviously there was no audible voice
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.680]   or anything like this. It's just a young man that's grown up with a relationship with the Lord.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:13.520]   And so in his heart, he felt these things. So that was the beginning of a journey.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:19.520]   And if you'd like, I can finish out a little more of that story at this point. Would you like to
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.040]   hear the rest of it? - Yeah, and make sure I want to hear, go ahead and finish that story. But then
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.080]   I also want to hear at what age your other children bought houses and how much they paid for them,
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:34.720]   as far as cash, to get the idea of the numbers behind it. - Sure, sure. And I think it's in the
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:43.200]   Home Debt Free book. And now I will, at this point, just without looking it up, I think it was
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:52.480]   somewhere around 80-some, a thousand, maybe 88, somewhere in there, that he told him he won for
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:12:01.200]   the house. And Nathan had, it was about 10,000 less. So then Nathan is officially on record with
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:07.280]   his family, anyway, of saying that he was going to tell them he was going to get this house.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:19.520]   And this was, I'm thinking maybe October. And then it was about a week after that, Nathan got a
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:27.440]   email from a national publisher of technical materials and said that they were interested
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:35.040]   in Nathan writing a book for them on Windows security. That is Windows, the operating system
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:48.240]   security, as opposed to doubles, you know, or your Windows SASH security. So he had been on,
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:55.360]   I think, a message board related to Windows security, and he'd been answering and dialoguing
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:01.120]   on some questions. So it wasn't just this email, just totally out of the blue. He had been
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:07.280]   interacting with these people all on a pro bono basis, just totally free and participating, and
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:13.920]   he was there to learn. And at the same time, he was sharing other things with them. And so they
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:23.840]   obviously had a very good understanding of his knowledge. But here he is, a homeschooled young
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:30.240]   man, never been to college, and all of a sudden they're saying that they would pay him to write
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:39.280]   this book. And they needed it right away. And I think it was six or eight weeks, something like
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:50.000]   that. And he would have editors working for him, and by all appearances, this amount would actually
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.400]   cover what he was lacking in his, for needing for the house. And so we were pretty excited about
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:02.320]   that. But in the contract that he had to sign, they had penalties if he didn't finish on time,
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:10.480]   because they said they needed it right away. So he is still praying about it, and he felt
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:17.920]   good about it, and I did too. And he's working for Western Auto, their corporate, their data center
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:24.720]   in downtown Kansas City at that point. And so he's got a full-time, call it job, as a contractor.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:32.000]   And then so he had Saturdays, and we don't work on Sundays. So with nights and Saturdays,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:41.280]   that isn't a lot of time. But he jumped in, he gave it everything he had. And at the end of the
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:52.160]   time period, he wasn't done. He was close, but not done. And so he wrote him and asked if they
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.240]   would give him an extension, and they wrote him back, they said, "Oh, Nathan, we knew you could
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.760]   never do it in that length of time. However, we need this right away. We had to keep the pressure
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:07.520]   on. So absolutely go for it. You're good." And he finished it. I think they gave him two more weeks,
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:15.760]   and he did it. And so you've got the feeling of accomplishment there. You have then God's
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:23.760]   provision of the additional money that's required. And frankly, probably maybe even to top all of
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:32.800]   that, you've got a young man who's seen, he can hear kind of in his heart a leading of the Lord,
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:41.200]   and know God is behind it and will follow through. I don't know what that's worth. I don't have a
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:53.200]   price tag on that. And yet, then so he went ahead and got the house, and they're still in it. We've
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:59.040]   done an addition to it. I say we, it was a collective family effort. And it's just really,
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:05.840]   it's been exciting. So he was 24 when he got it. I'm guessing he was, my wife's the date person,
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:14.480]   okay? She knows the dates. I'm not into dates. So he was probably 25 when he got married.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:20.960]   So they've been there, and four children later, and it's been a great house for them.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.040]   Wow. So he was your oldest then, and was the first of your sons to buy a house?
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.360]   Yes.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.080]   And then what's the story on the next one?
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.040]   Well, but I would say also, and we've had a vision. We have written up a vision statement
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.880]   years ago of things that we really believe the Lord would have us for our family, a direction
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:46.800]   from. And it's again, nothing mystical. It's just virtually going through the Bible, and certain
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:53.040]   verses would stand out to us, like that they would be ambassadors for Christ. They would be obedient.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:59.360]   They would love others. They would, just a number of things like that. And one of them was that they
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.640]   would buy their houses, and well, they would be debt-free for houses and vehicles and all that
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:14.560]   stuff. So this has been cast before them for years. It's been an understanding is this, this is who we
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:14.800]   are.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:24.640]   So it's a vision that's just been laid out before the whole family. And so it isn't about, okay,
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:31.280]   you're 18 now. I want you to understand these things. And it's not been that. This is just
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:39.840]   who we are. It's our way of life. This is what we're working towards. Jesus Christ is who we
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:49.120]   live for. I mean, wait, he died for us. We're here to live for him. And so this is, that's why it's
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:56.560]   not just step one, two, three. It's the life that we live. And so anyway, Nathan was the oldest,
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:06.800]   and it was exciting just to see how that all came about. It was the neighbor that came over
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:13.520]   and knocked on the door. So then Christopher, and most of the children are a couple years apart,
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:25.680]   so then we had Christopher. And he, what was it? So he would have been even in his late 20s,
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:32.080]   later 20s, and not married. They don't date. One of that was one of the things that we kind of
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:38.160]   encouraged them in is, by the way, dating costs a lot of money. You probably dated, right?
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:43.200]   No, my wife was the first woman I ever had a relationship with.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:49.440]   Wow, that's beautiful. All right. And but see, most, I dated with him finding my wife. Well,
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:55.920]   dating is expensive. And so if they don't date, then you save a whole lot of money in that.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:06.800]   So Christopher obviously then wasn't dating, and just he wanted to get married, but had his eyes
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:16.000]   open, and, "Lord, okay, we're looking who this might be." But somewhere in there, some other
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.760]   neighbors approached him and said, "Hey, Christopher, we've got this house." And there were
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:28.240]   two retired school teachers, and they're just great people. And you can imagine, two retired
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:35.280]   school teachers are not putting much wear on a house. And so this house was just immaculate. And
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:42.560]   he was very, the dad, or the husband, I should say, not a dad, the husband was very careful
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:48.960]   and maintaining it. So it was a great house. And I think they wanted, I also had that in the book,
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:55.680]   might have been 125 for it or something. And so they asked him if he was interested.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:04.480]   And it was also happened to be fairly close to Nathan's house. And so he said, "I'll tell you
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:10.880]   what, I'll start praying about it." And he starts praying. And we were actually on a trip. And I
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.720]   just kind of remember it was getting close to the time he told him he'd get back to them,
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.120]   because they wanted to move. They were in the process of building a house, and they needed to
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:25.040]   have a decision. And it just kind of kept going on. And finally, he just said, "I got to tell him,
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:31.680]   dad, I got to tell him, but I'm just, I just don't have an answer. I mean, I don't, it's not a yes.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:42.160]   I don't understand why. But it's, so if it's not a yes, it's got to be a no. And I don't have peace
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:48.320]   about it. And I'm the one saying, wait a minute. I mean, I'm careful." You're trying to control
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:57.360]   yourself. "This house is gorgeous. It's not going to take any work. It's right, kind of backyard
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:05.360]   neighbors with Nathan's, nice neighborhood. It's a good price. You got the money, you know, I mean,
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:14.640]   I just, but he said no. And I said, okay, okay. So then a short, oh, I don't know. Oh, no. And
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:22.720]   then on top of that, then the house next to that house, he'd been, he would kind of watch over
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.800]   their house for them when they travel. Well, they came to him and said, "Well, Christopher,
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:32.720]   why don't you buy our house?" So he had the money for the first house. He just didn't.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.440]   Yes, he had the money for the second house too. And the second house was really even nicer.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:45.760]   The mom was this gifted decorator and it was even nicer. And so he prayed about that. He was
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:56.160]   praying about that. Somewhere in there, our house, well, we have this ministry, Titus2.com. And
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:05.520]   the house really, the main floor is 2000 square feet. So it's a pretty good size house with a
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:12.000]   full basement under it. And so we had the ministry in one portion of the basement.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:20.160]   And since it involves books and we'd have books stacked there, and then we actually ended up
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:25.200]   stacking some books down the hallway, another bedroom. And then we had even at one point,
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   which is a story on the, built a shed out back to the maximum size the city would allow. And
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:40.720]   then we were storing books there and we still kept generating more books. And so we had kind of this
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:51.280]   mini crisis, call it. What are we going to do? We're out of room. And so we're discussing it
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:23:00.960]   and pray about it. And then somewhere right in there is when, I think it was Terry one day said,
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:10.480]   "Well, Christopher, you want to buy this house?" And we had totally redone the main floor,
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:17.680]   put in all new oak trim and doors and things. And it was just, we just liked the house very much,
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:24.800]   nothing opulent, just very comfortable and energy efficient. It had 10 inch walls. And so all of
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:31.600]   that, it was just, but what are we going to do for space? So Christopher said, "Well, I like this
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:40.560]   house a lot. I think I'd be interested in it. Let me pray about it." So at the same time, if we had
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:46.960]   bought a lot of this property right behind his house, not knowing what we'd use it for, but
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:54.240]   anyway, so we said, "Christopher, you know, we can't give you any bargain on this because we
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:03.600]   need the money to seed money to build a house there back there behind this. And so it's got
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.440]   to be good for you, son. If you just have to know that's what the Lord would have you because it's
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:16.160]   no deal. And we just, he'd have to get it appraised. And if it looked like enough that we
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:27.840]   could work with and he was good with it, then it would be good. And that's the only way that it
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:34.400]   would work for all of us." So he said, "Yeah, great." We got it appraised and they came in at
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:42.160]   210 and he had the money. I don't know how much more, but he certainly had the money
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:48.560]   without a problem. And as he prayed about it, he said, "Yeah, I'd love to get the house."
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:54.080]   I mean, so is this ideal or what? Can you imagine? I mean, we wouldn't have borrowed
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:25:02.320]   and yet how would you build a house without money? And where would you live? I mean, all of this
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:08.640]   stuff. I mean, I know people have those kinds of issues all the time, but here it was...
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.880]   How old was he when he bought the house?
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.360]   He was, I think, right at 28.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.280]   Okay. So at 28, he'd saved over $200,000 to pay for a house.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:23.920]   Yes. And so that property is adjacent to the one we're at now. And so building the house,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.320]   we just walked over. I mean, is that convenient or what?
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.600]   You can't beat lunch break when you can walk back to your own kitchen instead of having to
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.440]   bring a lunchbox to the job site.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:41.200]   Oh, yeah. So he was happy. We were just amazed at how the Lord worked all that out.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:51.680]   But in the new house, the whole entire basement would be dedicated to Titus II.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:26:00.080]   And then we would do a story and a half. And so the upstairs would be where what was like the
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.560]   living. The boys had a bedroom. There were two bedrooms. And so that would be upstairs.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:12.320]   And so it was pretty comparable to that current house, but just with the whole basement,
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:18.960]   well, walkout basement where we could bring pallets in for books. And so that's how it all
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:25.200]   worked. And it took us about three years to build it. We did have it roughed in, but then we did
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:33.360]   all the sheetrock, the plumbing, the electrical, the tile with the whole main floor is all tile.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:40.160]   We did all the concrete work outside. It was over a hundred and I think twenty five cubic yards of
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:50.240]   concrete. But I give you those details because the philosophy that the Lord has led us to is
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:27:00.960]   you learn, you work, and you do it yourself. And so we didn't know anything about concrete work,
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:08.480]   except like at Christopher's house when we built the shed, we just read up a little bit on it.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:14.480]   We did this big, long kind of drive sidewalk that a pallet jack could go to the back to the shed.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:23.840]   And it was all family. It's all family projects. That's how we learn. And the worst case I knew,
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:30.240]   OK, what if you have to jack hammer it out and throw it away and start over? You will have
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:37.920]   learned a lot in the process. And that first let me tell you that first sidewalk, even though it
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:45.760]   was relatively smooth and you could push a pallet jack back there just fine. I mean, it wasn't lumpy
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:53.120]   or anything, but it was it was ugly. It was really ugly. Sure. I believe that's how you learn. I'd
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:59.760]   love to I'd love to kind of find out more of how you did it, but I don't want to skip past your
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.080]   third son. How old? So your third son then also bought a house. And how old was he and how much
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:13.440]   did he pay for that house? OK, so then Joseph was 24. See, we have we have a Sarah, we have Sarah
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:21.040]   under the two boys, older boys, and then in a six year span where there were no children.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:28.720]   And then Joseph, the last actually five or reversal babies. So then Joseph, who was who was
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:37.440]   then 24, I think at that time, and he just really felt the Lord leading towards marriage. And and
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:44.400]   he'd been looking at houses and this house was it's about a mile away, whereas the other two are
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:55.840]   pretty close. And it was a little I just say a little distressed. I mean, they had it was very,
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:06.480]   very dated, you know, kind of crummy carpet. Some of the ceiling, the sheetrock work was quite dated
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:16.560]   and and yet but the price I think they they had been asking, I think, oh, maybe closer to 100 for
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:28.640]   and and then all of a sudden they came down to maybe 80 some. And no, I think I think that was
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:35.040]   I'm sorry, I wish I the book may have more details on in that regard, but I think it was around 100.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:42.000]   And then and then Joseph went looked at it and he offered them somewhere around 70.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.120]   And he was able to pay cash for that as well. That's impressive.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:52.160]   Where I'd like to go from here is I'd like to talk about how, but I would first like to start
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:59.520]   talk about why. Why was it such a big deal to hold this vision in front of your children? Why does it
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.000]   matter so much? What's the big deal about buying a house debt free to you guys?
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:14.480]   Well, the point is, is certainly in my lifespan, the houses that we had owned up until eventually
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:25.200]   with Christopher's, that was all with a mortgage. And mortgage, it's just always there. You don't
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:32.960]   get out of it. In fact, I could look, there was Jesus uses, he uses sin as an example and then
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:39.040]   compares it to debt because, you know, people because people universally understand they don't
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:46.960]   like being under obligation like that under debt. And so then he used that and tied it to sin to say,
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:56.720]   and that's how you feel once you resolve your sin. So, but the debt, it's uncomfortable.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:04.320]   I mean, frankly, and as a believer, I didn't even come to understand it as much until later,
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:13.120]   even as I studied. But, but the reality is, it's called, it is called a promissory note. I am
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:23.840]   promising that I am going to pay this. Well, I can't tell you what's going to happen tomorrow.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:32.880]   I wish I could, but I can't. And if I can't tell you tomorrow, how can I tell you next week? How
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:45.920]   can I say in a month, in a year? I talked to a dad that 20, I think 26 years with Hewlett Packard,
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:59.520]   26 years. And now he's been laid off. 26 years. And their whole downsizing, I think, could be
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:08.880]   close to 55,000. General Electric, when Jack Welch took over, I think there were over 400,000
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:15.280]   employees and eventually downsized for sure, I think down even around 300,000 if they're not
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:24.960]   lower now. And Jack Welch, in his book Straight From the Gut said, said that the days of corporate
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:34.560]   loyalty are over. The, you know, that essentially the only way there's any kind of job security is,
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:42.960]   is pleasing a customer. So one can't count on it. You just can't. And so here's always that debt.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.720]   We, we've known so many through our Titus II, we've just known a lot of families that have
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:33:00.160]   heartbreak. I mean, losing a house, absolute heartbreak. And so as long as one has that,
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:09.200]   that, that note, there's no promises, no guarantee that something's not going to happen that causes
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:15.120]   you to lose your house. So for you, then it's primarily from the perspective of essentially,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:20.000]   you've made a promise to pay and because you let your yes be yes and your no be no,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.200]   when you promise to pay, then therefore there's a moral obligation to pay. And by entering into
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:30.000]   a promise to pay, you're not sure if you're making a borrow. You're not sure if you can
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.360]   fulfill that. Is that, is that the primary theme that, that stands out to you? Absolutely.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.160]   Right. That makes sense. Cause I, I struggle. One of the questions that I have when,
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:45.840]   when reading your book is when I look at it and I think it through, you know, to me,
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.640]   so I come from a financial planning background and I like, you know, I think it's, it's, it's
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:55.920]   great to have a house paid off, but to me it's not really, it doesn't seem like a big deal one way or
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:01.360]   the other because in the current situation, at least where I live, there's no possibility of
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   ever removing any of your payments in the sense that even if you have your principal and your,
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:12.880]   your mortgage balance paid off, you know, where I live, my property taxes are 3000 bucks a year
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.440]   and my homeowner's insurance is 3000 bucks a year and I live in a fairly modest house. So
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:25.360]   even if I, even if I, even if I, you know, pay off the mortgage, that still doesn't change that
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.000]   there's still going to be a monthly or annual obligation there. So it doesn't seem to me like
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.680]   there's any emotional value beyond, it just doesn't seem like there's much value to it.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:39.680]   And then even I used to think, I guess, I used to think that there was some
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:47.200]   connection to, I guess, an emotional piece of just, hey, you know, we own this thing.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.880]   And then I ran into an issue with the code enforcement in my county and I discovered
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.960]   that the code enforcement officials, if they don't like something that I do, all of a sudden,
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.720]   they can put a lien up to a thousand bucks a day on my house and there's nothing I can do.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:05.760]   And that destroyed any last, for me, that destroyed any last vestiges of
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:14.000]   idealism about any ever owning your property, period. So like, it just doesn't seem that big
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.400]   a deal to me. Meaning that whether the house is paid for or not, we, in our current system,
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.800]   it's impossible to ever own your own property. And even when you think you do own your own
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.480]   property, you don't. Yeah, you are paying, you're right.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:34.640]   The point is you're paying your taxes in some ways, rent to the state.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.040]   Right.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:43.280]   And that is, you know, that is the way it is. But let's, you know, if the economy totally goes south
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:54.560]   and you have a whole vast numbers within a city that can't pay, well, you know, yes,
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.400]   they could eventually, I don't know what they did in the depression. Do you have a handle on that?
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.120]   Would they do it?
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.560]   Depends on what the depends on what the situation is. I mean, you just see that
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.880]   depends on where you are and you just see the market works its way out. And I mean,
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.280]   if you look back over the housing crisis since 2008, you can see our entire culture
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:18.240]   used to it used to be that not being able to pay and I'm speaking culturally, not morally,
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.000]   but from a cultural perspective, it used to be that not being able to pay your mortgage was a
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.880]   shame, was a source of shame. And there was a cultural shaming that happened because that
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:32.400]   was dishonorable, where I've seen me personally in the last five years has entirely changed.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:40.080]   And it's become that many of those negative connotations have disappeared culturally
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:44.560]   speaking. Doesn't make it right or wrong, necessarily. I don't want to judge my
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:49.280]   moral or ethical standpoint based upon culture, but I have seen that change in the culture.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:55.280]   Yeah, that is interesting. But I still listen. So if things get really bad,
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:02.640]   I have an electric bill. In fact, I know we had somebody write us two weeks ago,
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.520]   and they had no money. Well, they had just enough money either for the rent or the electric bill,
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:13.840]   one of the two. They paid the rent and so virtually had their electricity cut off.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.640]   And that's an option. They have a house. They are in a house. They have a place to stay.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:25.520]   And that is it. The same can go with water. And I see that as different. Now, if it gets all the
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:34.080]   way down to your property taxes, yes, still, I mean, the lowest denominator there. Yet,
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:44.000]   I still, it's not a promise. I'm not breaking my promise. And I am attempting to pay them as I can.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.800]   And they want their money is really what they want. So it's just, I think so often it's used
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:58.960]   as an excuse, though, as an excuse, as opposed to being responsible and just getting as much
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:06.000]   out of the way out of there off my, well, you know, as I can, like some will say, wait a minute,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.160]   I could never own a house debt free because in our area, they may be $500,000.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:20.720]   I had a gal from Australia, New Zealand, I think she was writing me that and she was she was being
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:25.600]   kind of sarcastic and said, well, in our area, you just couldn't, you just can't do that.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.160]   And then she went on to say, and I think I even used the example of the book.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:37.840]   And so I bought my house, I got my mom making mortgage payments. And besides, if I'd have paid
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:44.720]   that money down, I wouldn't have been able to travel the world like I have. You see, because
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.600]   usually what you'll find is it gets in the way of people's fun that they want to have.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:56.480]   And that's what in fact she was doing is she wanted to have her fun. Whereas if she would
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:02.240]   have spent, put everything she could down to get that house down and then work to pay it off.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:13.920]   It's just, it's a promise that has been kept. And one doesn't have to also at the same time,
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.840]   frankly, worry about it if things get really bad.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:25.040]   Right. And I know it's probably unusual pushback and maybe it's a generational shift or I don't
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:33.280]   know. I guess when I think about it, I have a world of admiration for your sons and the path
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:42.000]   they've been on. I think that's really phenomenal what they've been able to achieve. But sometimes
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.960]   I wonder, just sometimes I worry, me personally, I worry about the opportunity cost of what they
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:54.720]   could have done with that money. So for me, when I think about the idea of a young man spending
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:40:02.960]   $200,000 of his hard earned money that he saved, and especially if that's the bulk of his savings,
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:08.480]   I get so nervous about putting that and sinking that into a house where I have no control over
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:14.960]   it. And now if something happens, it's incredibly focused in one geographic area. It's mainly
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:20.480]   useful primarily for me to live in. And that's just about it. And I can think of so many other
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:25.840]   ways that I would personally be much more comfortable investing that money instead of
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:31.120]   purchasing a house. And so, but other previous generations have a very different field.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:36.000]   And so what I try to figure out is, am I wrong? And I just simply don't have the benefit of,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.280]   for you, maybe 40, 50 years of hindsight. Or is there a shift in our culture? That's what I worry
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:54.080]   about. Well, and I think, how do you, Joshua, I think, you see, once you've got the money,
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:41:01.040]   so for example, let's take John. He's next after Joseph, okay?
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:14.560]   And so he's now 23. He, they all have pretty much are developing businesses. So, John, at the same
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:21.520]   time as he's developing, saving, as he's saving, first he and Joseph had a construction business.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:28.240]   They had learned a lot of skills, and they just felt that that was, and we encouraged,
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:35.600]   trying stuff, doing stuff. So, they started this construction business. But with our traveling,
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:44.320]   as we would travel with Titus Two related things, then we found that, well, it's a little hard for
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:49.120]   a construction company. You give a quote, well, I'll be back in a month or something. You know,
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:56.240]   that's not necessarily ideal. And then also they were seeing that with Joseph. Joseph started,
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:01.440]   and I'm another part of the story here, he started programming when he was 10 years old.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:11.040]   And so, at this point, they're in their late teens, pretty much, and he saw that the programming
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:18.400]   money was really better than the construction money. And it wasn't, you're not out in the
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:23.120]   Kansas hot and the Kansas cold, and sitting at a desk a lot more comfortable. I'll have another
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:33.040]   cup of coffee, thank you very much. And so, they decided that some of the desk work, computer work
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:39.280]   was better. Well, John, about that time, had an opportunity, a friend that needed some,
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:51.600]   we'll call it in more general terms, agricultural design. And so, John decided, saw a need, and he
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:59.920]   went ahead and invested what money he had at that point. At that point, I don't think he had much
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:08.400]   over 5,000 in the bank, but still the emphasis is on saving. And at the same time, kind of along
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:12.320]   with what you were saying, I think, they had been investing in tools. They bought a truck,
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:18.720]   they bought a trailer, they bought tools. And so, that's income generation, and that's what they,
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:24.000]   so they had invested in that. And so, John's now making a direction shift. So, he
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:34.080]   starts this agricultural design business, and he just is pouring his heart into it. Well, so now,
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:41.680]   here he is, oh, I don't know, probably, certainly three years, three, maybe four, and no more than
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:50.160]   five years later, he has gotten to where he's pretty much the premier design, call it, studio
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:44:01.760]   in that segment as an independent designer. And so, as such, so he invested, he invests a fair
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:10.000]   amount in traveling and different trade shows, call it knowledge acquisition, contacts, making
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:17.600]   contacts. And so, that slowed down his savings, but now his savings are really starting to pick up.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:27.520]   So, yes, I understand about, well, where you invest, but we just really feel that one can do
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:33.760]   both. - Right. And I think about it, it's applicable to me because I have a one-year-old son. My wife
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:39.360]   and I, we have a one-year-old son. And as I think about, okay, what's the vision that I have for him,
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:47.360]   there's almost this constant tension in the financial planning business between what's
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:54.560]   mathematically correct or what we expect from the outcome of an investment versus the emotional side
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:45:00.240]   and perhaps the non-measurable and money values of life. You see this often in financial planning
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:05.120]   with the question of, should I invest or should I pay off debt? And so, different people have
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:13.120]   different ways of answering it. And I love the focus and the idea that three of your children
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:17.840]   have been able to purchase houses debt-free in their 20s is remarkable in our culture.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:24.320]   But that makes one part of me say, well, if they take that and not buy a house and just keep
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.720]   investing instead of $200,000, they'd be up to a million bucks or something right now.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:34.320]   And then they'd be truly financially independent. Then they would be in a position where
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.600]   they can live off of the income from their investments, which frees them to constantly
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.320]   increase their business skills and business opportunities instead of what I perceive,
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:50.560]   sinking a bunch of money into a house and then moving on. And then you're out of money because
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:55.920]   you put it all on a house. That's the conundrum that I try to solve in my head.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:06.640]   Oh, listen, absolutely. And I don't fault you. I mean, I understand where you come from. But see,
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:18.800]   with Titus II, I come in contact with so many dads that have had some of these investment
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:28.160]   philosophies and that becomes, they're going to leverage it and they're broke.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:36.960]   Then they don't have a place for their family. There's not the stability of at least a house.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:45.040]   And so when you're leveraging in other people's money, I mean, Sam Walton said
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:53.120]   that there was a day that went by that he didn't feel the weight of his personal debt.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:47:02.080]   And so it is so nice peace. What is peace of mind worth? I think it's worth a lot, frankly.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:14.240]   Because I don't know how you can, I personally, by all means jump on this. I don't know how you
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:22.560]   can have debt and not presume upon the future. And we're told not to presume upon the future.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.240]   So how can one do that?
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:33.920]   Right. It's an interesting theological conundrum. And I'm not sure that I've settled it in my mind
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:39.040]   personally, just simply because I've read and thought about it. And it seems that,
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:44.800]   you know, even in the end of your book, I can't remember which one of them it was that I read
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.000]   of yours, but even in the end of your book, you're clear to point out it's not that debt is a sin,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.560]   but debt is, in your opinion, in your theological understanding, but rather that debt is a
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:59.120]   presumption upon the future. And so it's unwise. And so I don't exactly know how to solve that
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.960]   conundrum. And I think it through. That's why I don't talk. Anyway, I think it through and I look
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:10.960]   at it from different angles. I go back to at this stage, like at this stage in my life,
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:22.480]   my wife and I, we bought a house and we purchased it. We didn't pay cash for it. We put down about
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:26.800]   20% on it. And it wound up, at the time I felt confident about the decision, but it wound up
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:31.680]   really hurting me because unexpectedly I made a business change and I had sunk all my money into
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:36.640]   this down payment on a house. And so here I was following, you know, following all of the,
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:44.480]   following the ideas and the ideals of prudent planning, saying, okay, put down a healthy
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:48.560]   down payment on a house. And then through a variety of circumstances, I had a bunch of money
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:52.720]   tied up in a house right when I was ready to start a new business. And looking back,
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:56.480]   did I make a mistake? I don't know at this point, it was too recent for me to look back and say I
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:00.160]   made a mistake. And even if I did, what's the point other than just to learn from it? I can't,
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:06.400]   I could sell my house and change from it. But when I look at it, I just get, houses end up being
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:17.280]   expensive sinks of money rather than a, necessarily a quality investment.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.920]   And what's, but what I struggle with is however, is that I can't, I'm a very kind of calculator
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:27.440]   focused person, but you can't necessarily always bring calculations into it because for my wife,
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:33.760]   the pleasure of having a house that she's comfortable in and, you know, it's very different
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:38.720]   for her versus me. So I'm usually at this point, a little bit slow to share my opinion, just because
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:46.720]   I haven't, I don't think I've experienced enough, enough to know. I don't think I have enough life
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.240]   experience to know exactly what's right, which is why I seek out older people. And I ask them
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:54.240]   these questions to try to figure out if I'm wrong or right. Well, and see, not only that,
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:50:02.080]   even from a financial guy, you know, a financial guy appreciates money. And so, so how much did
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:07.200]   you, what would, what'd your house cost? $220,000. Okay. So are, are you, I mean,
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.560]   you're going to know far better than me. Chances are you're paying over a hundred thousand in
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:16.000]   interest on it. I'd have to run the, I'd have to run the schedule, but I would say less than that.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.360]   Three and a half, three and a half percent loan. So it's probably, yeah.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:24.880]   Wow. Okay. But even, even say, let's, let's go get ridiculous. Maybe it's even 60,
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.960]   70,000 that you're paying in interest. Right.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:33.040]   Wouldn't you like that? If I wrote you a check, wouldn't you like that?
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:37.680]   And here you get into the problem of opportunity costs, because the question is,
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:43.120]   well, if I spend the, if I, what would I do with that money if I didn't do it otherwise? And if I
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:48.160]   were consuming it and spending it, then yes, the interest would be, it would be better to pay off
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:54.880]   the interest. But if I take that extra money and I invest it, and if I don't, if I invest it at,
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:01.520]   in excess of the interest rate on the debt, then mathematically the $60,000 is not a big deal in
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:07.840]   comparison to whatever the other money could be. And so that would be, that would be, or if I just
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:12.960]   simply deferred the, the housing cost and I don't want to go too deep into this, but this is always
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:18.640]   the war in financial planning. Because if I took that $200,000 and let's say that I had it in cash
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:25.040]   at 20 years old and I invested it, and let's just, you'd say I invested it at 10 for 10 years,
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:30.320]   10 years at 10% interest, then now with no further contributions at the end of 10 years,
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:35.600]   I'm up to half a million bucks. Whereas I would never, I would basically just expect the house
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.480]   to grow at the rate of inflation unless I were improving it. And so I would view the house as,
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.000]   it's not a wise investment, it's a lifestyle choice. And I always try to say, well, let me
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:49.760]   build investments first rather than, rather than lifestyle. So go ahead and respond to that. And
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:54.240]   then I want to move on to kind of how you did it, because this is a, this is a never ending circle
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:59.120]   that we go around and around and around. - Listen, absolutely. And I think, I think
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:06.720]   that's it. I mean, it really, each must, each must settle it in their own mind and be at peace with
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:16.000]   it. Absolutely. And, and I think, you know, as, as for us, when we look at the, the uncertainty of
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:24.320]   even the financial markets, the, the, the country, who would have thought of, you know,
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:31.840]   the Twin Towers incidents, you know, all that. So that's why, and each has to base, do it based on
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:38.320]   value to each one. And so we don't, we don't ever judge or even really scratch our heads, you know,
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:43.680]   on when, when somebody makes different choices. It's just each, each has to be at peace.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:48.320]   - Right. And I think, so for me, the idea of having fallback plan, you know, because you can't
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:53.760]   control things to me, that's, that, that would be key. Me personally, if I were, if I'm planning
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:59.040]   from that perspective, I don't think I would, I wouldn't choose this house, which is, you know,
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:04.320]   semi fancy and big and expensive to be that fallback plan. I would, if I were working on
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.400]   that fallback plan, I would, I think like, this is where you get into this constant question of why
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:13.200]   am I getting out of debt? I would keep the mortgage on this property and I'd buy, you know, an acre of
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:17.920]   land in the country and put a $10,000 mobile home on it. And that would be kind of, okay, if my
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:23.360]   financial life falls apart and I'm not able to make that promise, then I would have a place to
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:29.680]   retreat to that wasn't subject to, that wasn't subject to the bank as kind of my backup property
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:36.800]   to keep my family together. But you got to look at every situation. I'd like to move on and just
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:41.440]   talk about, and by the way, I appreciate you sharing your thoughts and, and, and feedback.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:49.600]   It's a subject I think a lot about and I am inclined personally, I think I place a lot more
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:56.240]   weight on the non-measurable, non-financially measurable things of life. Because to me,
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:01.680]   the only value of money is to fund life. And so if I'm spending all of my time,
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:07.920]   if I'm spending all of my time pursuing what was the appropriate, perfect mathematical solution,
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:14.160]   and I neglect and my wife is, is feeling insecure because, you know, I'm taking big risks with
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:18.960]   business and with leverage, then that may impact my marriage. And if my marriage falls apart,
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:24.960]   that destroys my life. Far better to walk away from a couple hundred thousand dollars of potential
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:29.840]   interest and keep my family strengthened and start from that strong home base. That's going to make
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:34.160]   a much bigger difference in my life in the long run. Excellent. Now, and listen, I'll even give
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:42.160]   you a little personal little example on that. So we were in, in Seattle area and had this very nice
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:52.400]   home with a mortgage on it. And I, so I thought, Oh, I need to be debt free. And so, and there you
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:57.760]   have one way to do it. There's two ways to do it. One is, is just sell the house. And the other way
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:04.480]   is to pay it off. Then that would, the one way is a little more painful, takes more discipline.
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:12.160]   By the way, those that didn't describe me at that time. And, and so, but my wife was
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:20.560]   on board, but she loved that house. And, and so we put it up for sale and sold it immediately.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:28.880]   Person walked in, loved it. Yes, we'll take it sold. And then we moved, I was working for Boeing
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:36.560]   at that time and we moved closer to where I was working and, and it was a rental house, big rental
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:44.000]   house. However, it, it just wasn't as, it wasn't as nice. It wasn't even in the, had a country feel
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:50.720]   to it, you know, many standards, not bad. It just, it just wasn't like the other one. And so here,
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:59.200]   my wife now, let's say celebrating being debt free, sitting on the back steps crying, you know,
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:09.200]   because of the one versus the other. So, so that, that emotional component is, is huge. And really
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:15.680]   the lesson I learned in, yes, I could go debt free at that point, but you still have to live somewhere
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:22.240]   and the family is very important. Yeah. I'll share another personal anecdote that I,
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:27.840]   that I was really convicted in recently is I'm this very personally, I'm, I'm this very extreme
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:31.920]   kind of person always saying, well, let's go to the, you know, to the far end of, of whatever the
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:37.040]   subject is. I mean, my show is called radical personal finance. So I often talk constantly,
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:41.280]   probably too much. Well, listen, honey, let's go live in an RV or let's go live in a tiny house.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:48.800]   Let's go like do these, do these things that are going to be financially so much superior. And my
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:55.600]   wife is, is, is, is, she's an amazing woman and she's game for just about any adventure. And,
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:00.960]   but one of the things I realized is that I wasn't, you know, her focus, everything that is
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:08.160]   the current, she spends all of her days here in the home and everything goes out of the house here.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:13.840]   And so we have a very different emotional connection to the stuff and their living
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:19.520]   circumstances and, and, and just to that. And I think I was being insensitive to her needs
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:23.840]   just simply by kind of focusing on, well, look, I, you know, I can live, I can work out of a,
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:28.480]   I can work out of a backpack and I can, and I was just being very insensitive and I was really
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:33.200]   convicted about that. And I decided that's it. I'm going to, I'm not going to complain anymore.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:39.360]   I'm not going to, I'm not going to, I'm not going to be insensitive anymore. And that really helped
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:44.960]   me to kind of free myself from this idea that I had to go and live out of my backpack, which is,
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:50.240]   I mean, it's okay that I would do that if I were single, but I'm not single and loving my wife
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:56.000]   means something very different. That's right. And then you've got a little one now. And I mean,
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.600]   I saw your, your string of photos of that little guy. So I sense that little guy's kind of important
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:09.360]   to you and he's going to continue to rock your boat and influence your decisions over time. And,
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:15.040]   and so, yeah, it's a, it's a, it's an exciting journey. All right. So we got a little bit,
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:19.440]   a little bit off on that. Where do you want to bring us back to?
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:24.800]   So how did you, how did your sons actually do this practically? What steps did you take as a
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:31.360]   father? I know you starting with a vision, but then practically to make this happen, because
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:37.360]   when your 23 year old son bought a house, this is the age at which is normal, normal advice in our
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:41.040]   society is that that's the age that, that your son would be graduating from college and would
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:45.440]   have maybe $30,000 of student loan debt getting ready to start his career. So what practically
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:50.880]   did you do differently such that three of your kids so far have been able to buy their houses
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:58.800]   debt-free? Yeah, well, it really is. We desire to prepare them. It's a journey. It's a process.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:06.400]   And I mentioned with Joseph how when he was 10, he started programming, learning,
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:16.320]   learning programming. Nathan, when he was probably, oh, certainly early teens is when
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:25.200]   their granddad was teaching. So it was asked what I thought about it. He was willing to teach them.
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:34.880]   It was a Radio Shack course on DOS. And so those, those two little guys, Christopher and Nathan
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:40.000]   would go trucking over to granddad's house. I think it might've been once a week and they would
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:48.080]   go through DOS and learn. And so, and that was kind of the beginning. So then over time, it's
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:55.840]   about looking for needs and filling them and what we can learn in the process. So then eventually
[00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:02.160]   Terry and I in the early nineties were asked to lead a homeschool group here in town.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:09.600]   So your kids, your kids are all homeschooled? Yes. So we, we agreed to do that. We had a
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:14.160]   newsletter. So we said to Nathan, Hey, would you be the, call it the editor? You know,
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:19.200]   we would write this stuff, but would you, would you put it in a newsletter for us? And so he,
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:26.320]   he jumped on again. It's, it's the exercising of then skills and abilities. And, and, and in that
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:34.480]   process and back then is when WordPerfect was, was you know, WordPerfect and Word, but WordPerfect
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:40.960]   was what we were using and, and he would get on a message board and when he'd have questions on
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:49.040]   formatting or different things. And, and so he over time he developed quite the reputation. I mean,
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:56.880]   and they, over time people started asking him questions and eventually then they,
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:06.320]   and WordPerfect invited him to be what's called a SysOp that he would be official part of it
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.680]   and answering questions. And, and that was a pretty big deal to this, this guy. And he wasn't
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:18.560]   that old at that point, I'm guessing somewhere 15, 16, and maybe even up to 17 through some of those
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:25.680]   years. And there were some perks, there was no pay, but it was perks. And, and, and so eventually
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:32.240]   though he, you know, so he's learning, he's, he's being challenged, he's growing and, and getting
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:41.120]   more technical. So then finally there was just some, it just was a time that we thought for him
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:49.280]   to stop and he, he agreed to stop that. But he had envisioned a career in computers. Well,
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:55.600]   about that time his sister saw a job opening downtown at a computer store that taught computer
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:01.920]   classes to, to the army officers from the, from the fort here. And, and so he didn't have a driver's
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:07.040]   license. I drove him down there, but he walked in there with a letter of recommendation on WordPerfect
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:14.480]   letterhead about his abilities to, in, in, in WordPerfect. And so here's this, the, the owner
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:22.160]   there who needs somebody to instruct. And he looks at Nathan who's partly shaving and, and he needs
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:28.800]   somebody. And then he looks at this letter again and finally says, okay, let's go for it. So at
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:36.080]   that point he, he started making, that was 25 an hour. So that was still a few years ago. He was
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:46.640]   making 25 an hour and I'm a electrical engineer. And frankly, when I, when I stopped or quit working
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:53.120]   in corporate America in '97, that's roughly what I was making. So here my son in his first
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.640]   kind of a job like that is, is making equivalent to what I was making per hour.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:07.600]   It's pretty amazing. It, what's clear to me though, from your story is that one of the reasons why
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:14.000]   one of the themes and one of the tools that you were able to employ in order to accomplish this
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.160]   as a father was that your children had a broader focus to their education than simply academics.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:27.520]   And there was a focus on academic skills, yes, but also vocational skills and developing skills
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:34.160]   at the market values. And I am really concerned about our broader culture because it seems to me
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:43.360]   that we extend childhood from zero to essentially at this stage is 20, 25 years old. And I had a
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:49.120]   remarkable experience in a previous company of working with a young man who had just gotten out
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:54.960]   of college and he was, he came from a very wealthy family and he never, he never wanted for anything,
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:59.440]   but he had just gotten out of college and for the first time in his life, he was working a job and
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:06.720]   was working a, it was his first job and he was 20 in his mid-20s. Now, thankfully he wasn't
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:11.040]   existing under the pressure of student loan payments or anything like that because his
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.720]   parents had paid for that for him. But I get, I'm so, I'm concerned that the average person
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:23.040]   graduating from mainstream government schooling doesn't have any ability to go and do that.
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:28.240]   But yet we, that, that your son, like you said, how old was he when he was earning $25 an hour?
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:31.280]   Oh, he was, he was 17, almost 18.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:37.600]   Right. And this is the world that we live in. And, but yet we've got to help children to
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.080]   develop those vocational skills. And it's just simply not being done in mainstream culture.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.280]   It's a real concern of mine.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:50.880]   See, that's why, Titus too, primarily it does practical kinds of things for the ladies
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.680]   scheduling because it's practical, it's applying her time, it's making the best of her time.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:01.760]   When we, we have, we just did a communication book. Communication is essential in every,
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:05.760]   in every aspect of life. It doesn't matter what you're going to do, man, woman,
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:13.600]   you know, I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't matter. And so, that, even the ability to communicate
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:19.600]   is just absolutely so, so lacking today. People carry on a conversation. They can,
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:26.160]   might be able to talk, but to be able to, to dialogue and, and learn. I mean, so we've,
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:31.440]   we've scratched the surface, for example, with you, Joshua, I have, I would just, you know,
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:39.040]   I'd have a blast getting to dig a little deeper inside that head, frankly. And I just, I just,
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.520]   I just love that kind of thing. And what, you know, what can I learn from this guy?
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:50.480]   And communication is what, and what enables us to do these things. And so, I mean, even when I
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:55.920]   graduated, I was a double-A, graduated from a reasonable school, went to work for Rockwell.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:59.920]   And I remember the first time I had to write up a business letter.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:10.240]   I was, I remember just, I was, I was at a total loss. I just didn't have to, to have to do it.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:16.000]   Whereas our guys, and please understand, I'm not bragging, but I'm using them as an example.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:22.720]   The skills that our guys have developed, I list a few of them in the book, and not just the boys,
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:33.680]   the girls, they are so strong in the skills they have. And, and so, and I can tell you stories
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.440]   about other, other young men and young women, you know, that have these kinds of skills.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:42.960]   And that's what it's about. If you put aside the entertainment, which is going to cost you a
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:49.120]   fortune, you know, that's going to bleed you dry. You put aside the entertainment and make learning,
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:57.120]   well, let's use the word fun, make learning fun. It's, it's limitless what you can do with young
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:03.440]   people. And, and that's what really is the preparation for life. Your jobs, people are
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:12.000]   looking for their jobs to, to be their security. Well, again, HP's cutting 55,000 possibly jobs.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.520]   People just become a cog, even if you're an engineer, you're, you're whatever, whatever
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:23.840]   you go to school for, you just become a cog. And, and then it becomes the business's financial
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:29.200]   responsibility to find who can do this job for the least amount of money, and therefore the
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:35.520]   greatest profit for the company and its shareholders. So, I think kids have to be,
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:42.080]   and adults as well, we need to be, we need to be robust. We need to be versatile, flexible,
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:46.960]   and, and constantly learning. Right. It's a,
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:56.800]   we have such a major opportunity. And especially when guiding young people, we have such an amazing
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:03.760]   world that we live in, where there's more access to the market. Like you said, I mean, a 12 year
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:11.280]   old today can go on fiverr.com and hire their services out as a, or go to 99designs.com and
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:18.320]   compete exactly as effectively as a graphic designer, as somebody who is, you know, 42 years
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.880]   old and has been designing for 10 years. It's all about skill. It's all about the application of
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:30.320]   skill. And I love, I mean, the stories in your book are plentiful, just illustrating to me
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:35.920]   the benefit that can come with home education as being an opportunity to train. And I want
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:40.320]   to give the math. So, because I thought this was really remarkable when I actually sat down and did
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:47.360]   it. And I was just thinking, okay, it sounds so impossible to be able to save. And your second
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:54.400]   son, I think his name was Christopher, who had paid basically $200,000 for the house. And I
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:09:00.880]   thought, well, how much would it take to save $200,000 for a house? And then I thought back
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:06.320]   and I thought of the work that I did over the years and the money that I squandered as a boy.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:11.920]   And so, I think I started working, well, I don't remember when I wasn't working jobs, but from the
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:17.280]   age of, I was educated at home through seventh grade and then I went to a private school from
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:21.360]   seventh through twelfth grade. So, I had to work around the normal school calendar, which was an
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:26.640]   advantage that your children had over me. But I still, I think I earned about, probably about
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:33.280]   $5,000 a year until I graduated from high school. And then I earned probably, while I was going to
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:38.080]   college, I probably earned $20,000 to $40,000 each year just doing just average normal work.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:44.400]   Until my final year of college, when I raised my income up to about $40,000 my final year of
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:49.840]   college. So, I thought back and I did the math on it and I said, okay, $200,000. Let's say that if
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.800]   I had been able to cut out a lot of the entertainment and the foolish things that I spent a lot of my
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:01.520]   money on and the lifestyle, and especially if I'd cut out the education costs, my college education
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:09.040]   costs were $20,000 a year. And I paid probably half of that by my best guess without having
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:14.880]   detailed numbers. The other half was covered by scholarships. If I hadn't, and I live in a world
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:20.160]   where I don't, the degree that I have, the only thing that it opened up to me was that in order
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.880]   to get my certified financial planner designation, they do require a four-year college university
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:29.680]   degree. But looking back, knowing what I now know, I could have taken the degree for, I could have
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:35.280]   taken the degree, I could have done that for $5,000, knowing what I know now, instead of $80,000.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:44.480]   And so I look at it and I say, if I'd saved $10,000 each year from, say, from 18 through 22,
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:50.800]   that'd be $40,000. And then if I'd saved $15,000 a year just towards the house cost,
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.600]   then there I've got, I'm getting a lot closer. And I did the math and I realized how,
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:02.160]   in many ways, the story of what your sons did should be normal. That should, in the sense that
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:07.600]   it's not, they really, as you said in the preface, I'm sure they're great young men,
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.280]   but there's nothing special about them in terms of, it's just a different path.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:19.440]   Yes. And so I think about this with my son and I think, wow, what if we switch these ages around
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:25.040]   and we shorten up and take care of the academic stuff at an earlier age and then add in the
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:33.920]   vocational stuff much earlier? And what an amazing future. Frankly, I'm not so sure that
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.840]   the powers that be would be very happy if we had many people doing that, because all of a sudden,
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:44.800]   we'd have a society of free men and women again who weren't enslaved to the tax-paying system.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:53.520]   You know, but listen, Joshua, friend, you got it. I mean, you really have. It's nothing
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:12:03.920]   abnormal. It's just the doors that it opens. And when people realize what young people are capable
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:13.680]   of and not incapable of, it just changes the whole frame of mind that, well, for example,
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:19.520]   you're business-oriented. You've probably seen a ton of articles, I've seen them, that all say,
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:27.760]   you got to work your passion, work your passion. You got to be able to do what you love. I mean,
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.200]   really, it sounds good. I mean, so you got all these guys that love hunting and fishing,
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:38.160]   and they're thinking, wow, you know, yeah, why am I working hard and sweating like this? I need to
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:45.440]   do the other. But now consider, and this is what really Christ would say, but now consider the
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:53.600]   concept of, maybe I should love what I do. Think about your wife. Do you think every aspect of
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:59.520]   taking care of your son, she absolutely just, I mean, you know, he just got sick and without
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:04.800]   getting graphic here or there, you know, and she is just absolutely thrilled to go take care of
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:10.640]   those needs. Not a chance. Yes, yes. Cleaning the bathroom, or you know, you maybe, if you split
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:18.880]   that, it's the same thing. It's, life is not going to be to where you absolutely just love everything
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:26.960]   you do, but how much better to train our sons and our daughters to love what they do.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:34.800]   Right. And what's funny is, what I laugh at, what I notice, let me not say laugh at, I notice
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:41.760]   oftentimes that what's old is new and what's new is old. There's a book, I forget the title of it,
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:52.400]   but this guy got very famous, but young man, very famous by, I'm trying, I can't come up with the
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:59.040]   name of it. He got very famous writing this book that basically doing your passion is wrong. And
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:04.000]   that the whole advice of like, go do what you're passionate about is baloney. This is a very
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:11.440]   popular book. And I played an excerpt of a speech he gave on my show. And his whole point was,
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:16.640]   it said, you can do two things. You can either do the work that you love, or you can love the work
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:20.560]   that you're doing and do it so well. And that's what makes room for you to do what you love.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:25.360]   And I thought to myself, every 85 year old preacher must be cringing in his seat of the fact
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:31.280]   that he's, they've been preaching this for 50 years. And now it's very hip and popular as long
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:37.280]   as a cultural society. It's a best-selling book. The guy's all over the press saying,
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:48.800]   put your heart into your work. So essentially, as I would sum up, and I don't want to spoil the book.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:54.080]   I want people to buy it and hear your whole idea. But basically the way that you did this with your
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:15:04.240]   sons, as I took away the formula, was to focus on building academic ability and then also concurrent
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:09.200]   with that, after laying a basic foundation of academic ability, then building in vocational
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:15.840]   skills and then dedicating time and resources toward exercising those vocational skills so that
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:21.120]   at a young age, your sons were able to make money and even a substantial amount of money compared to
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:26.320]   many others by developing skills. And so you invested in them by providing the equipment for
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:31.040]   that. Then encouraging and permitting the time where instead of needing to spend eight or nine
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:38.640]   hours or 10 hours a day locked up in a school doing busy work, they were able to spend maybe
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:44.240]   four hours a day doing academic work and another four or five hours a day doing earning work.
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.040]   And then by building in an ability for entrepreneurship, all of your children
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.800]   seemed to have their own business and their own independent form of livelihood,
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:58.560]   which obviated the need to go to university, which cut out the cost of university, and then
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:04.720]   allowed them to continue saving money towards their goals. And then when you put that formula
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:10.960]   together, it's relatively simple, right? You know, listen, I'll tell you now I know why
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:18.160]   you're the guy on that end of the mic, because what a great summary, truly. You encapsulated
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:26.320]   it very nicely. And so good job on that. By the way, I had forgotten, I would also encourage
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:34.880]   people that also like a little bit of taste of this. At Titus2.com, there's a newsletter,
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:42.720]   it's called Seriously Dads. And they're very short, but they're designed to be very challenging,
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:50.480]   little emails. And so that might be, you know, it's all going to be stuff along this line.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:57.520]   So it isn't going to be fun and games, no jokes. But may we be men and challenge each other
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:04.960]   towards that. And may we raise sons to be men, not just big boys. So that's the thrust of what
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:12.960]   we're about. I'd like to close just with, I think, two final questions. And so throughout this
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:19.120]   conversation, and even in the title of your book, and even in the statement that you just said,
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:25.920]   you have talked about sons, raising sons. And in your book, it says buying a debt-free house,
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:32.640]   equipping your son. So there's a reason why you have son in the title of your books.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.720]   Is there a difference between how you encourage and raise your sons and their financial path
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:43.200]   versus your daughters? And if so, what did you do differently and why?
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:49.200]   Okay. Well, we'll see if you—that's a mouthful, Joshua.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.000]   I told you it wouldn't be an easy interview.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.960]   Oh, it's great. No, no, you may have to bring me back on track, okay, just to remind you of that.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:06.640]   But for example, the daughters, I mean, because as Christians, the typical role is, yes, the man
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:13.760]   is the provider. And so that is—and that's the primary audience is going to be Christians. That's
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:18.720]   what they're going to relate to and understand. And in the very beginning of the book, we say,
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:27.360]   "And oh, by the way, daughters are going to benefit from this as well." And so it just depends. Each
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:35.120]   one has to choose what they're—and all of our, really, Mary just turned 18. And so all of our,
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:40.160]   quote, "children" are adults. And we don't dictate to them. They're making choices.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:48.800]   So for example, on the daughter side, and I could—oh, I would just love to tell you even
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:54.240]   just some of the stuff about our daughters. I mean, certainly, of course, there's the typical,
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:19:00.560]   I mean, they all love to—they love to sew and certainly cook. But Sarah, for example,
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:07.840]   10 years ago, we came to her and said, "You know, Sarah, the children's books that we see out there,
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:15.360]   well, we don't see a lot of positive books out there. Usually—well, here's an example. Terry,
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:22.960]   for example, Terry one day noticed—you know what a spitwad is. She noticed some spitwads
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:32.160]   on the walls. And—but she knew what they were, but where in the world do these things come from?"
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:37.440]   And so she asked the children, "Children, what—where did this come from? What is this up
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:45.600]   here?" Well, it turns out it was some children's classic, kind of classic children's book that had
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:55.200]   this stuff in it. And so they were learning what we would consider bad examples, bad behavior out
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:04.160]   of the children's books. And so—and that's very customary for them. And so we said to Sarah 10
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:12.640]   years ago, "Honey, why don't you write children's books but that don't have negative in them, that
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:20.480]   actually are positive peer examples and encourage children?" Because the written word is extremely
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:24.640]   powerful and especially for young children. I'm telling you, you know, your little guy,
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:29.840]   when he's three years old, if you started reading the Moody books to him,
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:36.320]   first off, you would find he'd absolutely love them. And second thing, it's going to be encouraging
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:41.520]   him to love his parents. And by that time, if they're siblings, to love his siblings. I mean,
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:48.480]   it's this host—to love the Lord, there's host of positive things as opposed to negative examples.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:52.800]   So anyway, she's been writing ghosts for 10 years. She just came out with her,
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:58.880]   really, I guess, ninth and 10th—well, the 10th would have been the Christmas book. But she's
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:04.560]   been doing that. So she's an accomplished author. And those books go around the world.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:12.160]   Children are saved through them. Moms and dads actually tell us how much they love these books.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:19.040]   So I mean, you talk about power and influence in a positive way. Because by the way, the same
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:24.160]   thing, the children in the example, they work, they have their own little home businesses. And
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:32.640]   it's all the things that we're talking about here, those are modeled with the children. So that's
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:40.720]   Sarah. But in that process, she has been—now, if this is going too long, you tell me. Sarah has
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:52.320]   been the manager of Titus 2 since, call it 2000, roughly, since back in 2000. So she is one sharp
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:58.640]   lady when it comes to managing a business, whether it be bookkeeping, tax laws, through the different
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:10.240]   states, an absolute phenomena when it comes to organization, incredible at communication, her
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:20.080]   skills, Adobe Photoshop. It used to be Quark, and now it's InDesign. And so she used to know
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:27.440]   QuarkSort. So you see I'm giving you, these are all professional-level skills that she has.
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:33.440]   And then now Anna, who's the next in line, and Anna's probably
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:45.920]   22, I'm guessing, somewhere in there. So Anna now, she has a lot of skills when it comes to—she
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:52.160]   does e-books and also the book layout now. So she has taken over InDesign.
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:23:00.000]   And that's been a lot of—I guess she's also been working with some photography and some other—but
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:07.760]   those are primarily for Anna. And also, all the five younger ones are all very accomplished
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:14.400]   musicians, and that was all self-taught. So Anna has spent a lot of time on music.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:20.080]   And then finally, Mary now, but she's just graduated, homeschooled, graduating now.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:29.680]   And we're finding she's an incredible artist. So we are fueling that. And she just did the art,
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:36.720]   the drawing in Sarah's most recent book. So we're always looking, how can we expand
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:43.680]   their abilities and challenge them? In our home, if I ask you to do something,
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:48.160]   and I mean, you know, nicely, if I ask you to do something, you go, "Well, I don't know how to do
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:57.440]   that." Then the answer is, "That's fine. We'll just give you a little longer to do it." And that's
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:04.240]   life. That's life. Yeah. To me, this is—you're hitting on one of my hot buttons. You talked a
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:09.920]   little bit in—I think it was your Buying a House Debt Free book—about autodidactism. And in the
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:15.520]   world we live—being an autodidact, a self-taught learner, and the world in which we live, we live
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:21.120]   in such an amazing time. I mean, let's see, in the last couple of weeks, I learned how to—well,
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:27.520]   right now I'm learning piano. I found some YouTube courses. So I take the iPad and I
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:32.400]   toss it on the piano and I print off the stuff online. And I watch these piano lessons on
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:38.800]   YouTube and I watch the instructor. And there's all the lessons that I need. I found a kid,
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:45.360]   a TED Talk one time of this kid in, I think it was Pakistan, somewhere in that region of the world.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:52.480]   Very poor, but he taught himself something like 15 instruments in that scenario. I've taught myself—I
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:56.560]   mean, the world of learning that we live in—I taught myself how to cut my wife's hair.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:02.560]   So I've been doing that. And I've been learning how to use a computer program. The first thing I
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:06.560]   do is like, "I don't know how to use this program." I go to YouTube and type it in and say, "Let me
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:10.560]   learn how to do it." And this opens up. It's hearkening. So what happens is there's this
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:17.280]   cultural war. I see this cultural war that happens in popular culture. And one of the major things
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:23.680]   that people try to do is divide it along gender lines. And to me, at least my vision, that's a
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:28.960]   whole involved conversation, which is probably appropriate in another forum. But to me, I look
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:35.120]   at it and I say, "I don't care that much. I mean, genders matter. Men are not women and women are
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:44.800]   not men." That doesn't mean that somehow women are destined to be stuck in the house as the cultural
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:50.800]   battle goes, barefoot and pregnant, and then the man is going to go off and conquer the world.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:56.880]   I desire to be at home and present with my family. And that's no different for my wife versus me.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:02.720]   There is a difference in responsibility. And the key is that both of us need to be freed and built
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:08.320]   up with those skills and with those abilities. And that I think a wise parent should be looking
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:14.080]   to equip their children with skills and with abilities. And those skills and abilities go
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:23.280]   beyond just academic skills. I want to close with, I'm going to read an excerpt from a book here.
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:27.280]   And I've been wanting to share just this. It's about a page and a half on the show. And I'll
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:34.160]   take the liberty of doing it now and then give you an opportunity to respond. Because this is
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:39.200]   right up your alley. But this is just a page and a half from John Taylor Gatto's book called
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:45.360]   An Underground History of American Education. And this is in a section entitled Extending Childhood.
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:50.480]   And to me, I think this is important information that people need to know. And it says, and I'm
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:56.320]   leaving out just a few sentences in it to keep it concise. So there are, I am skipping one,
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:00.880]   a couple of sentences here and there. "From the beginning," and this is John Taylor Gatto writing,
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:05.280]   "From the beginning, there was a purpose behind forced schooling. Purpose which had nothing to
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:11.200]   do with what parents, kids, or communities wanted. Instead, this grand purpose was forged out of what
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:17.840]   a highly centralized corporate economy and system of finance bent on internationaling itself was
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:26.160]   thought to need. That and what a strong centralized political state needed too.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.600]   School was looked upon from the first decade of the 20th century as a branch of industry
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:37.120]   and a tool of governance. In a speech he gave before businessmen prior to the First World War,
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:44.480]   Woodrow Wilson made this unabashed disclosure. "We want one class to have a liberal education.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:50.720]   We want another class, a very much larger class of necessity to forego the privilege of a liberal
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:58.560]   education and fit themselves to perform specific, difficult, manual tasks." By 1917, the major
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:02.720]   administrative jobs in American schooling were under the control of a group referred to in the
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:09.600]   press of that day as "The Education Trust." The first meeting of this trust included representatives
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:14.640]   of Rockefeller, Carnegie, Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago, and the National
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:21.840]   Education Association. "The chief end," wrote Benjamin Kidd, the British evolutionist in 1918,
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:29.280]   was to "impose on the young the ideal of subordination." At first, the primary target
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:34.960]   was the tradition of independent livelihoods in America. Unless Yankee entrepreneurialism could
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:39.920]   be extinguished, at least among the common population, the immense capital investments
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:45.920]   that mass production industry required for equipment weren't conceivably justifiable.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:51.360]   Students were to learn to think of themselves as employees competing for the favor of management,
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.240]   not as Franklin or Edison had once regarded themselves as self-determined free agents.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:02.480]   Only by a massive psychological campaign could the menace of overproduction in America be contained.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:08.240]   That's what important men and academics called it, the menace of overproduction.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:15.440]   The ability of Americans to think as independent producers had to be curtailed. Certain writings
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:20.640]   of Alexander Inglis carried a hint of schooling's role in this ultimately successful project
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:26.800]   to curb the tendency of little people to compete with big companies. From 1880 to 1930,
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:32.320]   overproduction became a controlling metaphor among the managerial classes, and this idea would have
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:38.240]   a profound influence on the development of mass schooling. I know how difficult it is for most
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:43.840]   of us who mow our lawns and walk our dogs to comprehend that long-range social engineering
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:49.680]   even exists, let alone that it began to dominate compulsion schooling nearly a century ago.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:56.400]   Yet the 1934 edition of Elwood P. Cumberley's Public Education in the United States is explicit
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:03.200]   about what happened and why. As Cumberley puts it, "In this, it has come to be desirable that
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:09.760]   children should not engage in productive labor. On the contrary, all recent thinking is opposed
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:16.320]   to their doing so. Both the interests of organized labor and the interests of the nation have set
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:23.600]   against child labor." The statement occurs in a section of Public Education called, "A New
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:30.080]   Lengthening of the Period of Dependence," in which Cumberley explains that, "The coming of the factory
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:36.880]   system has made extended childhood necessary by depriving children of the training and education
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:42.160]   that farm and village life once gave. With the breakdown of home and village industries,
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:47.520]   the passing of chores, and the extinction of the apprenticeship system by large-scale production
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:53.840]   with its extreme division of labor and the all-conquering march of machinery, an army of
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:31:00.640]   workers has arisen," said Cumberley, "who know nothing." Furthermore, modern industry needs
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:06.160]   such workers. Sentimentality could not be allowed to stand in the way of progress. According to
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:12.400]   Cumberley, with "much ridicule from the public press," the old book subject curriculum was set
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:19.520]   aside, replaced by a change in purpose and "a new psychology of instruction which came to us from
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:26.480]   abroad." That last mysterious reference to a new psychology is to practices of dumbed-down schooling
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:32.640]   common to England, Germany, and France, the three major world coal powers, other than the United
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:38.880]   States, each of which had already converted its common population into an industrial proletariat.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:45.600]   Arthur Calhoun's 1919 "Social History of the Family" notified the nation's academics what
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:52.080]   was happening. Calhoun declared that the fondest wish of utopian writers was coming true. The child
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:59.520]   was passing from its family "into the custody of community experts." He offered a significant
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:06.000]   forecast that in time we could expect to see public education "designed to check the mating
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.240]   of the unfit." And I'll stop there because it's a long, lengthy quote, but it's interesting when
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:17.520]   you get into these certain things. I think we have a moral responsibility in an age and time in which
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:24.880]   it's easier than ever to train children to be productive, autonomous, self-independent,
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:29.600]   functioning members of society with skills to provide for the needs of their life and the
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:34.480]   skills of learning the needs of their life. I think it's utterly criminal how we've removed
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:42.240]   that foundation of practical education from children. And if you look at the net result in
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:49.120]   our society and you look at the rising wage gap, the rising wage gap for men, the rising wage gap
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:55.760]   for women, the difference between the wages at the lower end and the wages at the top end,
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:01.040]   and you look at it, you can come to many different conclusions. But I often come to the conclusion
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:07.200]   that, interesting, labor is consistently getting cheaper. Why is labor consistently getting cheaper?
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:11.040]   And I keep looking to find the statistics on this. I've read, but I haven't been able to prove it to
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:19.440]   my satisfaction. Even in the course of gender roles, it gets very, very sticky. I try to read
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:25.440]   various people that talk about gender issues, and it's a big conversation that often with a show
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:29.200]   like mine gets you into trouble. But one of the things that I often wonder, do you not notice the
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:37.760]   fact that historically, that a man could support his family with his wage, and when you double the
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:43.680]   workforce, you have the salaries. And that's essentially what's happened in our culture,
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:47.840]   is if you double the workforce, you have the salaries. And I've worked in financial planning
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:56.640]   with so many families who are just so struggling and frustrating to struggle. They're frustrated
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:01.520]   with how do they improve their situation. And as I work with them to go through the situation,
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:06.880]   oftentimes just some very simple changes can make a dramatic difference. But we have the
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:13.040]   opportunity in starting, and by teaching skills, and pursuing another path, and building vocational
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:21.200]   skills that are needed and valued in the market. I mean, as your own story shows, and I pray that
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:27.360]   you continue to have continued success, and that you can maintain a clean testimony, and that
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:32.880]   because you can lay out for those of us who are younger and look at the problems of the world and
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.600]   say, "How do these problems get solved?" I think that what you've done is an important
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:40.880]   aspect of solving those problems. I give you the last word.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:48.640]   Listen, I've had a delightful time. I mean, truly, I think any number of these different
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:56.080]   areas, we could just kind of keep going on. I mean, because they're fascinating. We lose sight,
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:01.840]   I think people lose sight that the educational system, certainly once you get into brick and
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:13.760]   mortar colleges, it's a business. And it's about turning out product. And people have to look at
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:20.000]   all the factors that are going on versus just, "I've got to prepare my children."
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:29.040]   And it doesn't mean just because everybody else does it, it doesn't mean that that is the best
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:39.840]   way today. And I'll stop because I really, I just feel so strongly about it. We could really,
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:47.360]   this whole thing siloing, you come out of the schools and you're only trained in a little
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:53.360]   narrow fields versus being like you're doing, flexible, learning, expanding. This is what
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:59.680]   we model it first as parents, and then we work with our children and teach them as well.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:03.520]   Steve, I thank you for making the time to come on the show today. I've really enjoyed it.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:09.840]   And so your website is titustothenumeral2.com. And how many books have you written at this point?
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:18.560]   Any idea? I think Terry and I, we've probably got 10 and Sarah maybe is close to about 10 as well.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:26.320]   So that's great. And we have that for men seriously. It's for really guys that are
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:32.000]   serious, serious about what their job as dads is. And they can sign up there as well.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.840]   Right. I've read, let's see, I think I've read three of your books. I've read
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:41.440]   Buying a House Debt Free and Raising Sons to Provide for a Single Income Household. And then
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.640]   also your book, Redeeming the Time. And I have on my desk here, the book, Making Great
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:50.320]   Conversationalists, which is, I could do interviews on all of those subjects. I think that they're
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:55.200]   incredibly, incredibly valuable. So titustwo.com. And I would encourage people if you want to get
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:03.600]   the full story on your process, on the path that you've done, Buying a House Debt Free is a great
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:10.080]   book. And I will look forward to the update after all of your children are older. I'll look forward
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:15.200]   to hearing when they're all in their thirties and forties, hopefully they look back and at that
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:20.960]   point in time, hopefully they'll be proud of what you raised them. And then we'll find if there's
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:26.720]   the issue, then that'll come out. But I love to hear, I would love to talk with them and hear
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:30.640]   their stories. It would just be so interesting to me. Steve, thanks so much for coming on the show.
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:32.400]   I really appreciate it. Oh, thank you.
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:39.440]   Pretty inspiring, eh? I told you it would be cool. It's such a cool story. It's so neat to hear
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:45.920]   people who have accomplished things. I'm still not sure. I really struggle with the idea of just
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:53.360]   holding the vision of the house being the ideal, but I certainly understand why Steve does that.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:57.920]   I struggle with that a little bit personally, but I love the tangibility of that or the tangible
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:03.760]   nature of that as a goal for a young person, of holding that as a specific, tangible goal.
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:09.120]   You'll have to think about that and you'll have to decide how or what you want to apply from that.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:13.920]   But I really encourage you, get Steve's book and read it. It's well worth reading.
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:18.720]   He does a really good job in his book of presenting this as a comprehensive plan.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:26.560]   And frankly, it's pretty simple. Hold a vision before your child, hold a vision of what they
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:32.720]   can accomplish, and then help them build up a high amount of income through building job skills,
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:37.200]   through building work skills, through exposure, through creating businesses of their own.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:43.760]   Hold that vision of income and then help them to keep their expenses low and then build the
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:47.680]   character in them that they can do it with a vision where instead of saying, "Oh, I just can't
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:51.200]   spend any money and I got to go out and get out from under my parents' household and go out and
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:54.880]   blow a bunch of money," hold the vision of why you're doing and how you're helping.
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:39:02.320]   So that's essentially what the topic is. Also, the book is well worth getting just for the stories
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:06.480]   at the beginning of each chapter. There are a total of 15 chapters in the book. And at the
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:12.560]   beginning of each chapter, Steve tells a different story of a different young man and his story
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:17.360]   towards buying a house. And so I hope you enjoy that. It's really a great book. He does a good
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:22.480]   job of laying it out in a comprehensive way and it's totally integrated. It's really worth reading,
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:28.000]   really inspiring. And I'm definitely thinking a lot about that and how to hold that vision
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:35.760]   before my son. I hope you check it out. Real quick before I hit the music, I just want to
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.520]   give you a quick preview of what's going to be coming over the next couple of weeks.
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:46.320]   Tomorrow on the show, I plan to record and release the show that I had planned on Gratitude
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:51.360]   and Gratitude and Optimism. I think it'll be a great show. And so I plan to do that tomorrow.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.480]   And then on Friday, I'll be doing the Friday Q&A. I've got lots of questions and I love getting
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:01.120]   those questions. I still will need more voicemail questions. So if you want to call in those
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:05.360]   questions on the voicemail line, just go to the website at radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:09.360]   hit the Leave Me a Voicemail button. You can do it right on your phone, right from the road.
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:12.560]   I'll hopefully try to do it when it's quiet. That'll help to play it on the show. But you
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.000]   can do it right from your phone or from your computer and leave me the voicemail. And I do
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.640]   have a number of email questions as well. So I'll be doing that on Friday. Next week, I've recorded
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:25.040]   a bunch of interviews. I've got some really great interviews lined up. I've got an interview with
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:31.280]   Doug Nordman, who is, we're going to talk about the history of early retirement. He's known as
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:35.520]   Nords all over the internet and the early retirement forum. That's a great interview.
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:40.160]   I've got an interview recorded with Jeff, who writes at the Sustainable Life, talks about
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:46.800]   the integration of sustainability and green living and early retirement, personal finance.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:51.920]   I've recorded an interview with a man named Jonathan, and he has a site called 10K to Talent,
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:41:01.680]   where he talks about how to help your son or daughter develop their talent and understand
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:04.880]   how they can apply their talent in a way that the market would recognize. It's a really great
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:13.760]   interview. I've recorded an interview with Scott Young, who is the guy who did the MIT challenge,
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:17.440]   where he put himself through the MIT computer science curriculum in about a year. That's a
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:26.000]   really great one, where we talk about college. We talk about college and other ideas surrounding
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.920]   how to learn more easily. I also have an interview with a man named Dr. Vern Poythress,
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:39.520]   who is a professor. He talks about some things that he has helped with children and helping his
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:46.480]   children, helping his two sons matriculate to manhood at the age of 12. We had an interesting
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:51.040]   discussion around that and how to help that. I may play all five of those interviews next week.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:57.280]   My concern is I've wound up somehow recording a bunch of interviews on family, kids, all this
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:06.800]   stuff. This show is not the raising kids show. There have been several interviews with Christians
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:14.640]   and a lot on religious faith. That's also not the point of this show. I need a week or two.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:19.600]   I may play all these back to back next week, just so that I can get some time. I've got to get some
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:24.080]   stuff squared away on the website and get things improved. It is in rough shape. I need to really
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:28.800]   amp up the professionalism. I need to dedicate some time to that. I may next week play all five
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:35.600]   of those shows and do interviews. I may not, just because I need to vary the content. I don't want
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:42.720]   this to just all be... This is not the Christian personal finance show, which is taking me to the
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:47.600]   next thing. I do have a bunch of more interviews scheduled this week on some other topics. I found
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:52.160]   a couple of Canadian financial advisors that I've got interviews scheduled with,
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:59.280]   which will be good. I've got some interviews scheduled with a young lady who runs a personal
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:05.040]   finance blog for teens. I've also had an interview scheduled with a man named Ben Falk,
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:10.720]   who is a permaculture designer and really a neat guy focused on sustainable development.
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:15.200]   It's just a really, really cool guy. He does some really neat work up in New Hampshire,
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:18.960]   Vermont. I can't remember which state. I've got a bunch of cool interviews. I need to do
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:25.040]   some more technical interviews. I've got an interview lined up with Paul Merriman,
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:29.120]   who is a financial advisor, a former financial advisor, has a neat financial planning website.
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:33.920]   He's written a bunch of books to help many of you guys. I'm doing plenty of technical content,
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:38.560]   but I just needed some time. What I could really use some help with, I've got a bunch of topics
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:45.840]   on my list of potential topics that I'm going to be doing shows on. I also have a bunch of shows
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:51.760]   that I want to interview people on, things that I'm not expert enough with. I've had several
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:56.640]   recommendations from some of you people with Bitcoin guests, Canadian guests, which is
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:02.960]   something. I would love to talk with some people about ethnic differences in financial planning.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:08.560]   If any of you know anybody, I'm interested in different cultures' approaches to financial
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:17.440]   planning. Asian cultures, I would like to do a show on the Haitian and Latino practice. I don't
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:23.440]   know what it's called in Spanish. In Creole, it's called a soul, where they do this idea where
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:28.080]   everyone chips in. Every month, everyone puts in 100 bucks, and then each or every week, and then
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:31.920]   each week, it goes to a different person. That allows them to accumulate larger amounts of money.
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:36.000]   I'd love to do an interview on that. If you know much about that topic or if you know someone,
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.840]   could you get in touch with me? Email me, Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com. I'd love to do
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:50.080]   learn some about different religious approaches to money. I'm familiar with Christian theology on
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:54.800]   money, and I'm a little bit familiar with some Jewish teachings on money. I've talked with a
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:00.240]   few Jewish rabbis, but I'd love to bring somebody on the show who would talk about that and also
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:06.880]   Islam. I know there are Islam teachings and Islamic law about money. I'd love to learn about
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:11.840]   that. I'd also love to learn if there are other religions that have. I don't know if Hinduism or
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:16.640]   Buddhism have teachings about money. If any of you are experts in that or if any of you know anybody
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:21.040]   who you think would be an interesting guest on that topic, I'd love to learn about that.
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:27.520]   That would probably help to balance the content out a little bit on this show, which I think would
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:31.680]   be interesting. I'm just interested in those topics. I don't know anything about them.
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:39.040]   If any of you are on those topics, I would love to hear from you with suggestions. If you have
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:43.680]   other show suggestions, other show guests, I've got a couple of guests that I'm working on on
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:46.960]   some of the technical things. I'm going to do a show on the fiduciary standard versus the
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:51.840]   suitability standard. I ripped Tony Robbins apart on that, but I owe you guys an entire show so you
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:56.560]   understand that concept and that conflict that exists in the financial planning business to
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:04.000]   explain it clearly. It's not fair of me just to tear Tony apart, but I need to actually provide
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:09.200]   the education on that topic. I'm working with an attorney on that. I've got plenty more technical
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:12.880]   financial planning shows coming. I just wanted to give you a heads up on what's going to come,
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:15.600]   but I need to get some time. I'm going to be applying a bunch of interviews over the next
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.880]   couple of weeks so that I can get some stuff squared away on the site. Be thrilled. For those
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:26.160]   of you who aren't members, I'd love for you to consider joining the membership site. Major focus
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:30.720]   for me also is to enhance that. I've got an idea. I'm not going to take any more time today to go
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:39.920]   over, but I've been working hard on that to add some more content there. I'm going to leave it
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:44.720]   there, but I've been working hard on developing some content there. I had some conversations
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:49.920]   today with a First Perspective sponsor that I think will be a sponsor I can feel comfortable
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:55.040]   endorsing on the subject that I get more questions from you guys than anything else about how do I
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:58.960]   find a great financial planner and a great financial advisor. I've been trying to solve
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:05.200]   that question for you, and I think I may have it. I've got to work out some details with them still,
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:08.560]   but I'll be bringing that to you hopefully over the next couple of weeks as well.
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:13.040]   Exciting times on the show. I've been enjoying it. I hope you guys are too.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:16.960]   Working hard to make this great. I love your feedback. I love your suggestions. Feel free.
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:21.920]   Comment on the show. Make sure you can email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com. I love those.
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:27.040]   Love the reviews as well. I'm going to read one review as we go out here from iTunes.
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:33.360]   This review comes from CQ and CQ says, "Highly recommended. Most inspirational. I love this
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:38.000]   podcast. This is a perfect example of why podcasting is such a great tool to help people
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.800]   improve themselves through a wide variety of available subjects. It's obvious that Joshua
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:46.160]   is passionate about teaching personal finance and helping his listeners get a handle on their
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:50.480]   finances. If you are here because you are working your way out of debt, trying to reduce your
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:54.400]   spending, don't know how to invest or plan for college or home or retirement, or you just want
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:59.920]   to simplify your life, Joshua has already built a huge resource. He doesn't just cover the highlights,
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:03.680]   leaving you unable to apply those ideas to your own situation. He gives plenty of examples and
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:08.000]   when helpful, breaks out the calculator so you can follow along. Just subscribe and start."
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:14.080]   That's awesome. I thank you. Makes me feel so good reading that because it's getting across.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:20.080]   It makes me feel like I'm doing okay and getting better. So thank you for those reviews. I'd be
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:23.760]   thrilled if you haven't left a review. I'd be thrilled if you would leave a review. Don't do
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:28.000]   it for any other reason than me. I love to get them. They pop up on my phone and they make my
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:33.680]   morning. They usually come in around 5 a.m. or I wake up pretty early and I take a look at my phone
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:38.240]   and boom, there's a review. It's awesome and I get really excited. So if you value the show,
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:43.920]   leave me a review on iTunes or on Stitcher. That also does clearly help the show, helps other
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:49.040]   people feel good about it, helps with some of the social proof and it means a lot. So you can do it
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:53.600]   right from your phone. You can do it right from the computer. It's easy to do but I value those
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:49:00.720]   and I thank each of you who has left a review. Back with you tomorrow. Talk to you soon.
