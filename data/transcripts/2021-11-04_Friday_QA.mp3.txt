[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.200]   Looks like I got one, two, three, four, five callers on the line right now.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.680]   We'll see who else jumps on, but we begin with James.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.680]   James, welcome to the show.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.680]   How can I serve you today?
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.680]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.680]   Appreciate you taking my call today.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.680]   Let me mute my background noises real quick.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.680]   All right, there we go.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.680]   So my question is around blogging.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:56.000]   I do a weekly blog that is focused on what I read about history and what I observe from
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.800]   watching movies, taking in popular culture.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.360]   It's all about giving lessons in leadership and personal growth.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.120]   And I was curious for your take on how I would think about growing my blog audience.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.360]   Right now it's mostly just close friends and a few people I work with, about 60 people
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.920]   that I send a newsletter to each week.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.800]   And I'd like to grow the audience to several hundred people and kind of start to grow an
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.960]   online community.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.360]   And you've got a great thriving community with Radical Personal Finance and so a lot
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.160]   of experience with that.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.960]   And so I'd just be kind of curious with how you would approach that question.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.800]   That's a good question.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.200]   So first of all, let's confirm that blogging is the right medium for you to be focused
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.800]   on.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.960]   Does writing long form content, does that fit your skills and interests?
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.080]   So right now the blog is short form, about 200 to 400 words per piece.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.520]   So I guess that would be kind of more medium form.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.920]   So if I were writing 200 to 400 word essays, I would not write a blog, nor would I host
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.640]   that kind of writing on a blog.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.240]   I would host that kind of writing on Twitter threads.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.160]   That would be kind of the ideal scenario for Twitter threads.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.640]   And there are plenty of people on Twitter who write about, give their insights on history,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.320]   current events, et cetera, using in a relatively short format like that, 200 to 400 pages.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.400]   Sorry, let me rephrase, 200 to 400 words.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.480]   And I think Twitter there is your most interesting methodology.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.120]   And this is very current.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.000]   So I believe that blogs can be very useful.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.280]   However, blogs are kind of a 10-year-old technology that I think still have their places, but
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.920]   are not the current and cutting edge.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.120]   Right now Twitter is amplifying massively threads.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.080]   People like to read Twitter threads.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.840]   They like to observe them.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.120]   There's a very good reading experience.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.040]   And most of the time, people who are on Twitter really get annoyed by having to leave to go
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.160]   read some blog when they could turn it into a thread.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.520]   And so if your writing is medium form like that, or I would say short form, 200 to 400
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.080]   words, to me that's an ideal format to just simply go with the native platform and share
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.080]   your thoughts there.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.600]   It doesn't mean you can't also blog it.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.880]   It just means that if I had an essay that I wrote for 200 to 400 words, I would also
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.440]   take that essay to Twitter and I would start publishing that as a Twitter thread.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.960]   I think that if you're going to build a blog, there has to be a reason why that blog itself
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.840]   is the best kind of platform for you to engage in.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.680]   And there needs to be some strategy as to why a blog is the best strategy.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.280]   If you're focusing on writing, you want to start by saying, "Why am I writing?"
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.680]   So let me just ask you, why is James choosing to take his time and spend his time writing
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.840]   these essays?
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.600]   Why is James doing that?
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   Right.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:11.240]   My reasons are I love drawing connections between what I read from history, my own experience,
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.640]   and in dramatic movies and stuff, and then seeing how can we take those principles of
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.600]   leadership and personal growth and grow from them and become better people.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.120]   And so what I want to do is to, what I've been using the blog for is an outlet for that
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.000]   passion and I love to reach as broad an audience with my ideas as possible.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Okay.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   All right.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.120]   Do you have any ambition to earn money with this in some way or to support your personal
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.160]   brand in some way?
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.720]   So I don't have any ambition to make it a living, but it would be nice to make at least
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.560]   a little bit of money to cover my costs with it.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.160]   But your costs are nothing, right?
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160]   $10 a month.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.160]   I mean, there's no big cost here.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.160]   Right.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.160]   Right.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.160]   Okay.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.360]   So I just tell you that if you don't care enough, the cost thing to me seems silly.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.560]   Like when people say, "Oh, help us cover the cost."
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.680]   If you don't care enough about what you're saying to pay for your domain name, annual
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.000]   registration at $14.99 per year and pay whatever, a few bucks a month for web hosting if you
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.480]   have it, you don't believe in your ideas enough.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.200]   I mean, any of us should easily be able to support $50 a month of costs just for the
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.600]   value of our ideas.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.360]   To me, that's a negligible thing.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:34.720]   And I think that you can use your writing in many ways to support yourself.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.400]   There have always been writers who have been able to make a living directly from their
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.400]   writing.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.160]   And today, it's actually easier than it has been in the past.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.160]   Right?
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.600]   I subscribe to a not insignificant number of writers on Substack.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.920]   I have a number of different Substack subscriptions.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.840]   These are people who, many of them are anonymous, and I like their writing.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.360]   I want to pay for it and I want them to write.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.840]   And so I subscribe to their Substack.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.120]   So for a writer right now today, and there have been previous platforms, there are other
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.640]   platforms, but for a writer today, it's never been easier to actually monetize your writing
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.640]   directly.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.760]   And again, the leader in this right now is Substack.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.960]   I think that, let's talk through some of the strategic issues.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.760]   So first of all, it's very difficult to get people to come to your corner of the universe
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.640]   unless your stuff is really, really good.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:36.600]   I want you to imagine that right now, as I record this, I am in the great state of Tennessee.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.480]   So I'm driving through the hills of Tennessee doing a couple things here.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:48.200]   And I want you to imagine that you have a little farm, a little 10-acre farm out in
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.240]   the woods of Tennessee.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:59.920]   You can put up, maybe you might make the very best, you might be the best storyteller in
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.920]   Tennessee.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.960]   In fact, you might be the best storyteller in the whole world.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.080]   But if you're going to sit on your front porch and tell stories, the number of people who
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.720]   you're going to reach with your stories is exceedingly small.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.400]   Now you might have some neighbors around, right?
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.360]   There's a guy who lives in the next hall or over that he comes by in the evening and he'll
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.120]   sit out on your front porch and he'll listen to your stories.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.120]   And that guy has a brother-in-law that he says, "Man, you ought to come and listen to
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.600]   James tell his stories.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.960]   He's really got some great stuff.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.600]   You're really going to want to hear him."
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.080]   And so you can have a few people and you might wind up with three or four people that you
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.440]   know personally or who happen to be in your part of the valley who know that you're a
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.920]   good storyteller who will come and listen to you.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.600]   But it's very unlikely that those people are going to be able to amplify your message very
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   much.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.080]   You might be a world-class storyteller, but your neighbor is almost certainly not a writer
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.120]   for the New York Times, right?
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.760]   Your next-door neighbor is almost certainly not a guy with a million Twitter followers
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.200]   who will say, "Hey, listen, James is one of the best storytellers."
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.000]   And so you're not going to be able to attract an audience to your little farm in the middle
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.160]   of nowhere, Tennessee.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.600]   And that's what a blog is, right?
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.560]   A blog is a little farm in the middle of nowhere, Tennessee, and nobody's going to come to that
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.960]   blog by accident.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.280]   Now can it be found?
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:24.840]   Well yeah, maybe one day there happens to be a writer for the New York Times, an editor
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.040]   for the New York Times who's on a road trip through Tennessee.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.640]   His car breaks down and he's hiking through the woods trying to find help from a nearby
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.480]   farmhouse, and in the evening he comes up to your front porch and you're sitting out
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.880]   there with your corncob pipe telling stories to three of your neighbors, and he listens
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.960]   from the gathering dusk and he's like, "Man, this James guy is an amazing storyteller."
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:51.020]   And then he comes up and after you finish your story he says, "James, that was fantastic."
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.040]   And then you help him fix his car and get it back on the road, and then when he goes
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.320]   back to New York City he happens to go ahead and write an article about how there's this
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:03.800]   guy named James telling stories in the middle of Tennessee, and he tells you about—and
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.280]   then some people start to find you, right?
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.680]   And eventually people start to come, and then when more and more cars are parked by the
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.800]   road then it becomes a thing.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.560]   And so this is the model that a lot of people have.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.840]   They think if I'm just sitting out in the wilderness telling my stories people will
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   come.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.560]   If I build it and I'm good enough people will come.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.360]   There was a day in which blogs themselves were more findable, right?
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.040]   This was the early days of web searches, and so if your content was well suited to be scraped
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:35.920]   by the crawlers who would find your content they would send people to your blog.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.600]   But all of those things have changed over the past years, and because they have all
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.040]   changed you have to make a difference.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.760]   So the first thing I would say is if you have a message that you want to get out and you
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:53.120]   want to tell stories it makes far more sense for you to leave the rural farm and much more
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.280]   sense for you to go where the people are.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.360]   And so maybe you go into downtown Nashville, Tennessee and you start telling stories from
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.360]   the town square.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.160]   Well you've just increased dramatically the opportunity that you have for people to
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.680]   actually hear you.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.320]   And so that's what telling stories directly on social media is.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.640]   So each of the media platforms that you have, you have Twitter, you have Facebook, you have
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.240]   LinkedIn, each of these and others as well, right?
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.040]   There are plenty of other niche sites.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.400]   Medium would be a better example of one that could be very useful.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.200]   But each of these places is like a big town square where there are lots of people gathered
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.200]   there.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   And so if you simply take your insights and you take your messages to those platforms
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.760]   there's a better chance that people will be able to find you because you're native on
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.120]   the platform.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:49.120]   In addition though what you can do with those platforms is you can go and find the conversations
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.640]   already happening.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.440]   If you imagine yourself as a street preacher, a street preacher would have a hard time,
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.240]   usually has a hard time attracting an audience.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.680]   Standing on the street corner preaching about Jesus is coming soon and you need to stand
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.160]   there and you need to repent.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.400]   A few people will stop and listen to him.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.200]   But if a preacher will go and find where something is happening and find something relevant,
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.520]   will find a place where people are gathered together and then start preaching, then there
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.160]   would be more likely that people will listen to him because he has something to say that's
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.160]   relevant.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.920]   So this is what social media does.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.040]   So if you're on Twitter and you observe how, you know what, there was just this election
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:32.760]   happening in Virginia and we see the leadership lessons, the good things and the bad things
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.600]   from this election, and you go and you start posting about topics that are very current,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.680]   that's what Twitter wants.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.520]   It wants to be very current.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.920]   And then in addition to that you can go and you can find the places where people are already
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.520]   talking about this stuff and you start talking to them about it.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.840]   You start responding, replying, sharing, etc.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.520]   And so you respond to a guy who makes a good point.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.300]   You reply back with some thoughtful comment, expand the conversation.
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.000]   He clicks on your profile, starts reading your threads, and he hits subscribe.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.040]   Now that he's hit subscribe, your subscriber base starts growing and then more and more
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.640]   people will start to see your content and Twitter starts to amplify it across the platform
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.560]   as hey, this is a guy that you might want to be seen.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.120]   And so you comment on trending topics and you show up in people's explore tab when they're
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.160]   just aimlessly flipping through.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.760]   And so I think that there's no way to get around that.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.600]   That should be your first step.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.000]   And for much of your content, even if you just hosted it natively on the platform, that's
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.760]   really the best situation.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:33.120]   Don't go to LinkedIn and post a link to your blog.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.880]   Just go and take your blog and post it into LinkedIn if it's related in some way to leadership
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.060]   and you're posting on your LinkedIn profile.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.340]   Same thing on Facebook.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.100]   Now text is not featured heavily right now by Facebook.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.100]   Video is king.
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:54.140]   Pictures are queen and text comes in at a very distant last.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:59.340]   But still, it still is more powerful for you to post an actual post, an essay natively
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:05.080]   into Facebook than to post a link outside of Facebook to your Facebook profile.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.380]   So I would build that.
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:12.180]   And then the other thing that you can do is take some of your content and go to platforms
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.980]   that have a larger web presence.
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.460]   So let's say that you have your personal blog.
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.980]   What you should additionally do though is you should additionally be taking some articles
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:26.740]   that you would otherwise post on your personal blog and post them to Medium.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.740]   Why?
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.220]   Well because Medium has a much bigger presence.
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.660]   It's much more likely to show up in the searches.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:38.020]   And so if someone's searching about something that's current, then the Medium search results
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:44.300]   will come up higher in the list than will whatever your personal URL is.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.360]   So these are just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.220]   But I think the first thing is don't spend your time telling stories on your front porch
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.920]   in the middle of nowhere.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.700]   First go to the places where there already are people and start telling your stories
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.540]   there, sharing your insights there.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:04.140]   And then from time to time go ahead and refer them back to your front porch, your personal
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.140]   blog.
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.500]   And that should be, you know, at this, when you're beginning that should be 20% of what
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.500]   you're doing.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:14.580]   In the very beginning 80% of your time and effort should be finding people out there
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:20.260]   and building up followings in the other space with 20% of your time spent building your
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.820]   own real estate.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.460]   Then as you are able to send more people to your real estate, then you focus more on your
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.700]   own personal real estate and start moving people in that direction.
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.620]   So that's how I view it, James.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.620]   Go ahead.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.620]   Sure.
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:40.500]   Yeah, just like that right now I share links to the blog on like LinkedIn, but I don't
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.500]   post it directly on LinkedIn.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.840]   So I think, and then I don't have any presence on Twitter right now.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.100]   So those are, you know, two good action steps I could go ahead and take with it.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.420]   Remember that you're trying to make things as seamless as possible for your readers.
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.820]   And most readers don't want to go outside of the native platform.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.420]   When I'm on Twitter, right, and I spend a lot of time on Twitter, when I am on Twitter,
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.500]   it's very unlike, I don't want to post on an, I don't want to click on an outside link.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.640]   Now I do it, I do it, but I often don't want to post on, click on an outside link unless
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.480]   there's some real value.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.620]   So for a 200 word essay, there's no real value of my clicking on that.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.460]   Just put that as a Twitter thread for me where I can just bookmark it right on Twitter.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.260]   Now a 6,000 word essay, don't post that on Twitter.
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:31.180]   Post that on your blog and then create a Twitter thread telling me the basic ideas and then
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:36.640]   referring me to your 6,000 word essay where I can go for the long form content.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.620]   But you'll just have, you'll have far more, find the most popular people talking about
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.100]   your subjects.
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.780]   Find the people who have the big followings, et cetera, who have the conversations and
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.540]   just start genuinely adding to those conversations.
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.940]   That's the best way for you to start building your public platform.
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.660]   Yeah, that sounds good.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.660]   Thanks for the advice, Joshua.
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.660]   My pleasure.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.660]   All right, we move on to Derek.
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.660]   Derek, welcome to the show.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.660]   How can I serve you today?
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:08.620]   Hi, is this the right Derek?
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.620]   That's the right Derek.
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.620]   Go ahead, sir.
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.620]   Okay, sorry.
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:12.620]   Hey, so I had a couple of questions.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.100]   I'll try to be quick on both.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:22.780]   One is regarding the topic of, I'm sure you've been dealing with this with clients, but we
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.620]   bought a house two years ago in New Hampshire.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.860]   And as you might imagine, it's gone up quite significantly in value.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:35.140]   And I was wondering if you've come across any topics lately about people taking advantage
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:40.860]   of that or leaving that alone because of where that might be going or what you consider good
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.780]   opportunities.
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:51.180]   We bought at around 455K and it's just a Zillow score, but they're saying it's like 600K at
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.260]   this point, just after two years, which is mind-numbing and crazy to me.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.260]   But that's what they're saying.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:06.260]   And then the other topic was just about general business starting and some threads to go down
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:11.980]   as far as if I wanted to start a business and I have a certain amount of capital potentially
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.660]   related to the first question.
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:18.820]   So I guess with the first one, have you been talking to a lot of folks about their houses
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.300]   going up in price recently and taking advantage of that?
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.300]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.620]   So let's talk about the first one and then call back next Friday for the second one and
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.260]   we can deal with that in more detail.
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.380]   But let me give you a couple of frameworks to consider this.
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:38.100]   The first thing I would say is look at your house and ask yourself, is this house an investment
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.860]   or is this house a home?
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.740]   Either is fine.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.340]   A home can be a wonderful investment, but I think there's a different way that you look
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.780]   at it and you operate differently.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:54.540]   If you buy a house as an investment, then it really doesn't have much emotional meaning
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.540]   to you.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.820]   It's not something that figures into your long-term future.
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.780]   It's just a matter of the money.
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.820]   On the other hand, a home can mean many more things.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.580]   And when I was younger, I discounted the value of those things more than I do now.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.260]   I increasingly see the value of having the home place.
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.500]   I increasingly see the value of being invested into the place that you love.
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.860]   In fact, I think that investing into the place that you live and transforming it into a place
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:26.100]   that you love is a fundamental component of actually living rich.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.780]   A number of years ago, I read the great book that Michael Masterson wrote on basically
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.780]   how to live rich.
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.420]   And he talked through – it's a topic that of course I love.
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.220]   My show was about how to live rich now.
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:43.380]   And his experience as a wealthy man, he was talking about here's how you live like a rich
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.380]   man.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.660]   And it was a very tactical book.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.300]   He talked through the kind of mattress that you live in, the kind of car you should drive,
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.140]   the kind of clothes that you should wear, the kind of music you should listen to, the
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.140]   kind of house that you should live in.
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:58.580]   And his basic argument in the house that you should live in was that if you want to live
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:03.020]   rich, you want to live like a rich man with regard to your house, you certainly should
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:07.660]   choose a house, a neighborhood, et cetera, that fits you, that likes you.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:15.580]   But the reality is what makes a house the house that a rich man owns is not how ostentatious
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.580]   it is.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:21.860]   You can go and you can buy a flashy ostentatious house that feels completely soulless.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:27.660]   What makes a house feel rich is when that house is personalized to you.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.620]   It reflects your life.
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.780]   And that can be your style.
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:37.360]   Yes, you spent $100,000 to redo the kitchen, but you redid it the way that you like a kitchen
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.360]   to be.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.380]   It can be the art that's on the walls or the books on the bookshelves, but it should be
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.900]   your house.
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.480]   It reflects you and your personality.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.380]   And I just appreciate that more and more and more.
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:53.220]   I feel like there's real value to that, and that in the US American culture where we move
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:21:00.100]   so much, we often diminish the value of having the home place, having the place that we love
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.960]   because it's ours, it reflects us.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:08.760]   And so in that situation, if you're living in a home that is a good candidate, it has
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:14.100]   the bare bones that you want, and it's the neighborhood that you like, and it has the
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.860]   structure, then I would ignore the nominal value of the home.
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:18.860]   Why?
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.900]   Well, because your house is increased in value from $455,000 to $600,000, but that means
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:30.580]   that if you sell it, the house that was $600,000 a few years ago is now $800,000.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:36.980]   And so if you just sell it and move up, you're going to wind up having the same general inflation
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.380]   that all of the home values have had.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:44.860]   And so I think that if it's your home, you basically ignore the nominal value, ignore
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:50.540]   the nominal price, and recognize that if you're buying and selling in the same market, it's
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.660]   not a deal for you to sell.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:57.060]   And in fact, you're going to incur a whole bunch of expenses, realtor expenses, financing
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:02.980]   costs, moving costs, the disruption in your life, the time involved packing all your stuff
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.740]   and getting the next house just right and getting the next house's furniture fit because
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.980]   your previous furniture doesn't fit the room quite so well.
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:15.140]   I think that if it's your home, you ignore the nominal value and just simply keep it.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:20.220]   Now, if it's an investment, here are the arguments in favor of you going ahead and selling.
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:28.420]   To begin with, you look and say, "Is the increase in my home value due to this particular property
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.500]   or due to the general market?"
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.000]   So if you bought the house for $455,000 and you could sell it today for $600,000, but
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.300]   every other house that you're going to buy has also had the similar increase in value,
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.780]   it's not that much of a deal for you to upgrade.
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.340]   You're going to wind up with a larger mortgage.
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.160]   You're going to wind up with higher property taxes.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.860]   You're going to wind up with your own expenses going up.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.500]   You might as well just sit with the $455,000 house.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.380]   On the other hand, if you bought a house strategically, maybe you forced up the value a little bit
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.480]   by fixing up something that was messed up, or you bought a house that was strategically
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:05.340]   growing because it was an attractive neighborhood, and if you have some arbitrage opportunity,
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.140]   then absolutely it can work well.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.020]   So I guess the question is, do you have an arbitrage opportunity?
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.180]   Do you have an opportunity to move from a neighborhood that's increasing value to the
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.340]   neighborhood that's going to increase in value next?
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.860]   Do you have an arbitrage opportunity to move from one house to a significantly better house
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.140]   that you've got an angle on?
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.900]   Do you have an arbitrage opportunity to move from one state to another state?
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:30.140]   Do you have an arbitrage opportunity to sell now, take some tax-free money, and then wait
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:35.440]   for a downturn in your neighborhood because your market is artificially inflated in terms
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.700]   of the demand?
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.660]   These are all dangerous games, meaning they're not guaranteed.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:46.620]   You can be priced out of the market fairly quickly, but if you're wrong, and I'll just
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:53.380]   give you an example, in 2017, I sold the house that I was living in at that time, and I sold
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:57.540]   it because I wanted to sell it and I didn't want to own a house, but I thought that I
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.420]   was – excuse me, I guess it was 2016.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:04.020]   I sold it because I didn't want to own a house at that point in time, but I had a good
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.020]   bit of appreciation.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:09.260]   I wanted to take some profits off the market, and I wanted to move and change my living
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:10.300]   situation.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:15.460]   But I did think that there was going to be a decline in real estate prices in the next
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.620]   year or so.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.860]   So I thought, "You know what?
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.980]   Maybe I'm selling six months early, but I'd rather be six months early than six days late,"
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.860]   because I thought prices are getting high.
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.500]   I think there's going to be a correction.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.980]   I think there's going to be a major change.
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.020]   I thought that.
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.020]   I was wrong.
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.020]   Then I thought, "Okay, 2017, there'll probably be a recession."
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.020]   I was wrong.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.340]   2018, yeah, I was still wrong.
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.700]   2019, there's got to be a recession.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.700]   Nope, wrong.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.060]   2020, all right, maybe there's not going to be a recession, but it's still possible.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.220]   But then the recession came in 2020.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:50.180]   And then two weeks later, the recession was over, and housing prices in my market had
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.820]   not changed at all.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.300]   And so now, here we are in 2021.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.980]   I don't want to own a house, but I've been house shopping.
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:01.660]   And so I've looked at it, and I'm fascinated to see so many people are priced out of the
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.660]   market.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:08.100]   Thankfully, I'm not personally, because I make excellent money, and I'm not broke.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.860]   But I've watched, if I didn't make good money, if I were broke, I would be priced out of
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:13.860]   the market.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.540]   I have a friend of mine that I've given advice, right?
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.660]   Had a house, sold his house, wanted to get cashed in, right?
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.020]   But now, he's trying to move back to the same place, but he spent the money, and he's priced
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.020]   out of the market.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.280]   He's not going to be able to live there because he's priced out.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:32.500]   So you got to be clear on your plan and understand, "Okay, if I'm going to play this strategically,
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.340]   how am I going to make sure that it's a win-win?"
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:39.780]   And I do think that selling, locking in profits, especially tax-free profits with the sale
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:45.780]   of a house, I think that these are all really good options, but you need to be clear that
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.260]   you're going to invest the money into something better.
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:53.420]   Otherwise, often, the expenses are higher than you think, the expenses of time, mental
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:59.380]   energy, et cetera, and often it's best just to sit tight until your plan changes.
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.380]   Sure.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:09.700]   Yeah, so I was actually going, what you were saying was interesting to me, so I didn't
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.700]   stop you.
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:17.980]   The route that I was kind of trying to lean you towards was not keeping versus selling.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:23.540]   It was more along the lines of opportunities associated with refinancing.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:32.460]   But your answer to the first use case of living richly in the house and investing in it, it
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:40.500]   kind of affirms one of the two routes that I was taking on, taking the $150K, $120K,
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.380]   whatever, and putting it back into the house to make it more...
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:48.180]   Because I think that we overpaid for the house.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:54.660]   It's not as updated as it probably should have been even back in 2019, but there's definitely
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:27:00.740]   a lot that I could do with $120,000 to put it back into the house.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.420]   And this is definitely a home for us.
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.420]   Good.
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.180]   In fact, we've actually taken on...
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:13.980]   We've moved up my parents-in-law to live with us from Philadelphia, and that's been its
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:22.220]   own adventure, as you might imagine, but we're building quite a location here, I think, as
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.660]   far as inside the house.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:31.740]   But you've definitely affirmed the idea of reinvesting into it with the increase in value
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.740]   for me.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:37.020]   If you have the money and it's not going to cost you...
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:41.260]   If you have the money, then definitely you should reinvest into the home.
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.900]   Number one, this is a very good investment.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:50.700]   Investing into your personal residence is a very good investment for most people, and
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.620]   it's an investment that has benefits.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:58.380]   The financing costs of your own residence in the United States, very inexpensive.
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.120]   The tax benefits, massive.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:05.860]   The security, the protection from difficult real estate situations are substantial, even
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.900]   including foreclosure.
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.580]   So even if you got into stress, you definitely want to be foreclosed on a house that you
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:17.220]   own and live in, rather than a rental house, in terms of your legal protections and the
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.300]   bank's willingness to work with you.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:23.220]   And so if you can spend some money and update it, go ahead and borrow it out at low rates,
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.140]   et cetera, and update the house, then do it.
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.580]   And do it while you can enjoy it.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.500]   One of the things that a lot of us tend to do is we wait until we're ready to list the
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.180]   house or we're going to sell the house a year from now, and then we start spending money
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.660]   left and right, fixing the house up, getting ready for the buyer.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.820]   Well, in that case, you don't get to enjoy it because you deal with months and months
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.900]   of construction hassle, and then the house is wonderful, and then you're gone.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:50.940]   Fix the house up when you move into it so that you can enjoy the updates, and you'll
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.220]   get more use of your money.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.180]   Thank you very much.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.860]   That was a great thinking on your part.
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:01.860]   Great to meet you.
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.860]   Good, my pleasure.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.700]   Call in next week, and we will talk about your business question.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.060]   All right, move on to John.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.060]   John, welcome to the show.
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.060]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.060]   We're delighted to serve you today.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.060]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:17.060]   I have a question about moving cash around physically.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:26.740]   I had a friend a month or so back who had a loss of their, I think it was a grandmother.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:33.180]   And the grandmother was moving across country to be with the kids.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:37.780]   And she didn't know much about their finances, but the grandfather had a substantial amount
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:45.100]   of cash in his safe deposit box, presumably for a specific reason, which I kind of thought
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.060]   of, maybe they shouldn't put that money in the bank to transfer it.
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.940]   Maybe they should just physically move it.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.940]   I'm not sure what they really did.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:57.940]   I didn't really follow up, but it kind of brought that question to me about how would
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:04.460]   you, not crossing international borders, just going a far physical distance away within
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:10.300]   the United States, what would be the best way to move that money, if not just physically
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:16.860]   transporting the cash, which can be bulky, not really educated on the transition costs,
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:22.460]   carrying things to gold and back to make it more compact, or things like, obviously, there's
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:28.420]   Bitcoin, if it's a short term, maybe that's a viable way to transfer the value across
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.420]   the country.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.940]   But what would your take on that be?
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.740]   I think the value, by the way, was somewhere, my best guess from talking to them was somewhere
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:41.900]   in the range of like 50,000 to, I don't know, I can't imagine it was over 250,000, but I'd
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.660]   say it's somewhere in that range.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.700]   So 50 to $250,000 is not that big of a deal, right?
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:52.220]   This is money that can fit into a small, a few envelopes, more than a few envelopes.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.540]   Right, well, a van full of cash.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.740]   It's not that much, right?
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.780]   If we're talking millions of dollars of cash, then it gets very different.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.300]   But 50 to $250,000 is not that big of a deal.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:09.300]   So I'll give you two, the two methods that work is to take it, and you can take it, you
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.940]   can take it on an airplane, you can take it on a car.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:16.580]   I'll talk to you about the advantages and disadvantages of both, and/or to mail it.
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:20.040]   And mailing it is a very good way of sending cash as well.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.460]   So I'll describe both of these, both of these things, and I'll give you the rules that you
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.580]   would follow if you chose one or the other.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:34.340]   To begin with, there is nothing illegal about having and moving around with significant
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.340]   amounts of cash.
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.500]   There is no law being broken.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.920]   There's nothing illegal about it.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:46.980]   The concern that there is, is one small concern, and that concern is confiscation by a police
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.340]   officer.
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.860]   That is the concern.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:53.660]   Now here, it's hard because that concern can be quite overblown, right?
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:58.320]   I did a show, I talked about this in a podcast recently where I explained how, when a police
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:04.780]   officer confiscates money, I'm blanking on, what is it called, the seizure, help me out
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.300]   John, what is the term, the technical term?
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.300]   >>John: I think it's just seizure of assets.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.980]   >>Steven: Yeah, but there's a technical, it'll come to me in a moment as I'm speaking.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:20.220]   But there is a seizure process that the, this is bugging me, hold on a second.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.380]   >>John: It's the end of the show, so you'll have to remember.
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.380]   >>Steven Yeah, okay.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.660]   So, civil asset forfeiture, and sorry for the blip, I bumped the wrong button on my
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.580]   recorder in just 20 seconds while I was looking it up.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.580]   Civil asset forfeiture.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.020]   The term is civil asset forfeiture.
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.380]   So what is civil asset forfeiture?
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:40.180]   In the United States, in most states, there's one or two minor exceptions like the state
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:41.500]   of Maine, et cetera.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.020]   But in the United States, there is a risk of what's called civil asset forfeiture.
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:52.900]   Basically, if a police officer comes into contact with a large amount of currency, physical
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:33:01.380]   currency, that police officer can seize the currency until or unless you can prove its
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.400]   legal provenance, right?
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.700]   You can prove how you came by it legally.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.700]   That's the law.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:13.140]   Now, this law is the worst civil asset, one of the worst civil rights abuses right now
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.180]   in the United States that happens.
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.740]   But how often does it happen?
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.900]   It's not, I don't know how to describe it, right?
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.660]   It happens frequently, but it's not like every police officer is out there searching every
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.180]   person and saying, "Oh, here, you have 20 bucks on you.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.180]   This is gone."
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.180]   So what are the rules, right?
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.340]   Well, the first thing is generally $5,000 is considered to be the number.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:39.660]   So if you're in possession of more than $5,000 of physical currency, you wind up having a
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:45.300]   risk to the possession of that currency, and it could be subject to civil asset forfeiture.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.300]   But most police officers, first, they're not going to come into contact with it.
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:53.660]   Number two, they're not necessarily going to take it, especially if you've got a good
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.780]   explanation.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:34:00.760]   So if you look like a drug dealer, you smell like a drug dealer, and you've got a suitcase
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.060]   full of cash like a drug dealer, yeah, they're going to take it.
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.980]   And then you're going to have to sue them to get it back.
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:10.300]   And the suing process is a real hassle because you have to prove it to their satisfaction
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.380]   order for them to get it right.
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.260]   You're not innocent until proven guilty.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.580]   You're guilty until you can prove that you're innocent.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.740]   So it is a serious risk, but we also have to put it into a framework of recognizing
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:25.620]   that it's not like you could just never carry $50,000 in a bag.
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.900]   You could carry $50,000 in a bag.
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.240]   But that is the risk.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:33.620]   That's what you have to be concerned about is the civil asset forfeiture.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.620]   So what would you do?
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:40.500]   Well, if you wanted to move $200,000 of currency from one side of the country to the other,
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.860]   you have two ways to get-- again, we're going to talk about taking it there and then mailing
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:44.860]   it there.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.900]   The other way would be taking it there in a car.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.460]   So you say, I'm going to drive from one side of the country to the other.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.060]   Again, there's nothing wrong with this.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.020]   There's no law being broken.
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.380]   You're not doing anything suspicious.
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.380]   It's your money.
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.680]   You can do whatever you want with it.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:03.420]   So what could you do in order to improve the likelihood of your getting it to the other
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.260]   side of the country without it being seized by the police?
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:11.660]   The first thing that you want to do is you want to make sure that there are no indications
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.860]   on your car that would wind up having you run a risk of being pulled over.
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.940]   So the first thing that you do is you check your automobile, and you make sure that your
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:22.260]   automobile is a legal automobile.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.820]   By legal, I mean it doesn't have green-colored lights on the front, which in some states
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:26.820]   would be illegal.
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:31.340]   By legal, I mean it doesn't have a radar detector sitting in the window, which in a couple of
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.260]   states is illegal, and it gives them cause for them to pull you over.
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:38.740]   By legal, I mean it doesn't have tinting that's too dark, which a police officer can pull
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.820]   you over because the tinting is too dark.
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.780]   By legal, I mean that the lights work.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.740]   There's two lights on the license plate.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.300]   The license plate is not obscured.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.100]   It doesn't have a border around it.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.860]   You can't have a border or a cover, even a translucent cover on a license plate in most
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:52.860]   states.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.180]   By legal, I mean all the lights work.
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.500]   By legal, I mean you have tires that have the proper amount of tread that are properly
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.500]   inflated.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:03.060]   By legal, I mean your car is not covered in Bondo and sagging at the back because one
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.060]   of the shocks is broken.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.880]   It's just a normal, appropriate automobile.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:12.420]   If you will drive a normal, appropriate automobile without all of these indications of your being
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:18.180]   either poor or a crook or having some weird thing going on, "Hey, the back of that car
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:25.580]   is too low," then your likelihood of being targeted by the police is extremely low.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:30.700]   You definitely don't want to load up three of your buddies and drive across the country
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:35.260]   with four of you sitting in a car, crew cab style, when you have a bunch of cash.
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.820]   That is a major reason why a police will pull you over.
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.860]   They'll pull you over because there's four guys in a car, especially if you're young.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:45.500]   If you've got four guys riding crew cab style in a car, you're going to be pulled over because
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:51.060]   there's a very good chance that a police officer can find a warrant on one of you.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:57.020]   You go with a couple or one person or a family, not four young males in a car.
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.940]   The next thing is you just drive appropriately.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.540]   You drive the speed limit.
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:07.220]   Probably best in most places, three and a half miles an hour over the speed limit.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.220]   You drive safely.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.260]   If you speed, you can get pulled over.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.620]   If you go too slow, you can get pulled over.
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.380]   If you drive too carefully, if the speed limit is 60 miles an hour and you're driving 60
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.940]   miles an hour, you can get pulled over because this guy is driving too carefully.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.920]   He's probably trying to hide something.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:26.220]   If you don't run a stop sign, you just drive properly and your chances of being pulled
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.380]   over are very, very low.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.240]   You should prepare for being pulled over.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.520]   What do you need to do to prepare for being pulled over?
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.740]   Make sure that the car has a clean title, that it's not wanted by somebody, that it
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:42.640]   wasn't stolen, it doesn't have a stolen tag because then it alerts on some automatic license
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.700]   plate reader system, "Hey, there's a stolen car.
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:45.700]   Get pulled over."
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:50.220]   If there's any question about there being some kind of problem with your car, you got
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.220]   a problem.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.040]   Make sure that you don't have any warrants.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.040]   Check your driver's license.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.660]   Make sure there's no warrants out for your arrest.
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.500]   Make sure there's no giant stack of unpaid parking tickets, et cetera.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:02.980]   If a police officer pulls you over and runs your driver's license, that there's no problem
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.980]   there.
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:08.740]   Make sure that you're clean driver record and a clean car.
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:16.020]   Then you want to prepare your automobile defensively in case of search and/or seizure by the police.
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.020]   What do you do?
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.260]   First, you want to make sure that your automobile is clean, that there's no reason why a police
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.940]   officer would want to search your car.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:29.380]   It would be a good idea not to carry around a gun visible on the back seat.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:33.100]   Police officer walking up to your car, sees a gun sitting there, that's a problem.
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.420]   Or any indications of that, spent ammo or something like that.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:40.860]   It'd be a good idea not to have to make sure that your car is clean of drugs so there's
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.480]   no odor of marijuana coming out of the car.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:50.260]   You want to make sure that there's no reason that would create a suspicion in an officer's
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.260]   mind.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:55.420]   In order for an officer to search your vehicle without permission, which we'll get to in
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:39:02.620]   a moment, the officer needs some level of reasonable articulable suspicion for some
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:07.980]   searches and/or some level of probable cause.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.820]   With probable cause, the officer can search your vehicle.
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:17.860]   You eliminate anything that could lead to probable cause or its junior neighbor, reasonable
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.420]   articulable suspicion.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.140]   You make sure that there's nothing there.
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:27.660]   I would drive with the vehicle totally empty inside.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.940]   Or if you had something, it would be something innocuous.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.500]   It would be a car seat strapped in the back.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:37.180]   Something innocuous, not full of junk, not full of things that go, "What's that down
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.180]   there?
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.580]   Does that look like a marijuana roach down there?"
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.580]   Things like that.
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.180]   Make sure the car is clean and empty.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.560]   Doesn't say too much of a story about you.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:51.560]   You want your cash to be in a locked container in a separate locked compartment of the car.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:55.960]   Now, here I'll give you a couple of the things, but some of these are harder to do.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.020]   But there are levels of search.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:04.100]   When a police officer has searchability, the levels of search are based upon the amount
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.640]   of probable cause that he has.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:10.200]   For example, in any state of the United States, if you're walking down the street and a police
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:15.160]   officer stops you, the police officer can do what's called a Terry Frisk.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:22.000]   A Terry Frisk is a very simple outside of the clothing pat down or wipe down to make
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.440]   sure that you're not carrying large obvious weapons.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:30.260]   This is where if a police officer says, "John, will you please step out of the car?"
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.260]   You step out of the car.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.380]   A police officer has the right to search the outside of your clothing.
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.400]   This is known as a Terry Frisk for officer safety.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.760]   What the police officer cannot do is start going through all your papers.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.440]   You can't pull out your wallet and start digging through your receipts to try to figure it
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.440]   out.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.080]   This is a pat down for officer safety.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:51.840]   Now if a police officer has additional cause, then that police officer's search—again,
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.640]   this is all without consent.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.720]   If you give consent, it's all over.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.400]   But without concern, the officer's search can go farther.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:04.720]   So let's say that the officer is concerned about officer safety and pulls you over on
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.160]   the side of the road and says, "John, step out of the car."
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:10.960]   The officer can do a Terry Frisk on your purse, can move you to the back of the car, and can
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:15.720]   do a quick visual inspection or maybe a quick look underneath the front seat, etc.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:21.280]   What the officer can't do is open up a locked trunk because the locked trunk is not a concern,
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.360]   is not a threat to officer safety.
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:27.720]   If the officer has probable cause that you might have some kind of illegal substance
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:33.760]   in your trunk, for example, if the officer has called out a canine unit and the canine—the
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.960]   dog has alerted to the presence of drugs in your trunk, now the officer has probable cause
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.400]   and can force the search of your vehicle with a warrant.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:48.520]   But if there's no probable cause, then what's in your trunk is not going to cause the officer
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.980]   any safety concerns.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.800]   So you want to create separation.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.400]   And you want to make sure that there is a locked container.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.960]   In addition, you want to heighten your expectation of personal privacy.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.760]   So if I were transporting the cash, I would get some sort of locked container.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.400]   It could be a locked briefcase.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.600]   It could be a locked toolbox.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.360]   It could be a locked Pelican case.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.880]   It could be a locked—any kind of—anything that's locked because this adds weight to
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.720]   your legal argument that you have a heightened expectation of privacy.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:20.960]   I would have a locked container, and then I would keep that locked container in a separate
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.640]   locked part of the vehicle.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.680]   So if you have a car with a trunk, that's ideal because you have a separate locked trunk.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:31.260]   Now if you were doing this every day, if I were transporting cash for some business or
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:37.640]   something like this, maybe, for example, you are running a marijuana business in a state
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.560]   where marijuana—the sale of marijuana is legal.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.920]   Licensed marijuana dealers have a problem right now.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:49.180]   Their trade has been deemed legal in certain states.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.440]   They have a license from the state.
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:56.440]   They can have a marijuana dispensary, whether it be for medical marijuana or for recreational
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.440]   marijuana.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:03.000]   So their business is legal in the state, but because marijuana possession is still illegal
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.260]   on a federal basis, they have a very difficult time getting bank accounts.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:10.880]   So let's pretend that I were running a very successful marijuana business and I hadn't
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.280]   hired an armed guard service to move my cash, which would be the obvious solution.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.280]   What would I do?
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:21.560]   I would have a vehicle that has a locked trunk, and I would make sure that the trunk of that
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:27.400]   vehicle is on a separate key and that the remote release of that vehicle has been disabled.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:32.420]   So if you go back and you study police searches over the years, if a police officer has reason
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.200]   to search your car and there's a little trunk release there, then the officer can just pop
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:42.280]   the trunk release and can pop the trunk open and find whatever's in the trunk.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:46.680]   But if the trunk release has been disabled and the officer doesn't have a key for the
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:51.680]   trunk, well now he has to have a higher level of proof to get a warrant to actually impound
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.840]   the car.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.720]   Years ago, there was a case, and I looked for this story.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:01.880]   I read the story in one of the resources that I had found, but I looked for the case and
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.880]   I couldn't find it.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:08.680]   I read a story about a drug dealer, a guy, like on the street drug dealer, who carried
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.680]   cocaine in his car.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:16.000]   But what he had done was he had installed a private safe in the trunk of his car, meaning
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.400]   just like a house safe.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:23.560]   He had bolted it into the trunk of his car and he carried his cocaine that he was dealing
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:26.040]   in that safe in the trunk of his car.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.960]   Well it so happened that the drug dealer got pulled over, got arrested, and his car was
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.800]   impounded by the police.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.200]   But it was impounded by the police and it was in the impound yard for several days while
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.760]   the police were trying to figure out how to get into it.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:43.280]   By the way, when you're arrested, then your car is searched either with a search incident
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.320]   to arrest or with an inventory search.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:51.080]   When the police confiscate something, they do an inventory search of the car so they
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.080]   know what's in it.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.560]   So this can put you in a vulnerable position.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.480]   So police did an inventory search of his car, but they couldn't get into the safe.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.400]   They couldn't bring in the safe cracker to actually get into the safe.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.280]   So the guy got out of prison within a couple of days.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.760]   He bailed out, bonded out, et cetera.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:09.440]   And he went and he got his car back and the police never found the cocaine that was in
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.320]   the safe in the guy's car.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:16.640]   So that's the basic concept that you're trying to follow, legally speaking, is you're establishing
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:22.360]   a heightened expectation of privacy and then you're putting in place these hurdles so that
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:29.920]   if you are subject to search non-voluntarily, that there's no reason why a police officer
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:35.880]   would be able to invade your privacy, which is a violation of the Fourth Amendment, would
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:41.760]   be able to invade your privacy in order to confiscate, to find and then confiscate the
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.900]   cash.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.960]   So the final piece of all of this is you never consent to searches.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.120]   You do not consent to searches.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.200]   And so if you just simply know how to not consent to searches and you don't consent
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:59.920]   to searches, then this practice, while civil asset forfeiture is a legitimate threat, and
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.880]   I would be concerned driving across the country with $100,000 of physical currency in my back
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:12.400]   pocket, if you put these things into place, then there's virtually no chance that your
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:16.120]   cash would be actually confiscated.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.980]   Because in order for it to be confiscated, you would have to have come to the attention
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.800]   of a police officer, in addition to coming to the attention of the police officer, the
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:30.760]   police officer would have to have some sort of cause, some sort of probable cause for
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.600]   pulling you over in a traffic stop.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:38.320]   That police officer would have to have some kind of cause for forcing a search.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:42.000]   If you refuse a search of your vehicle, then he has to have some kind of probable cause
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.320]   to get a search.
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.460]   If he's got probable cause to search inside of your vehicle, okay, maybe, but he's got
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:52.760]   no probable cause without a warrant to actually invade something like a locked container held
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:56.960]   inside of a locked container such as your trunk in a separate compartment from the vehicle
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.720]   because he cannot argue that there's any threat to officer safety from something that's held
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.680]   in a separate compartment of the vehicle.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:09.720]   So if you put that in place, that will exploit the laws that are in place for your protection
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:16.440]   and that will allow you to assert your constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy in your person's
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:20.520]   papers and effects against the police search.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.760]   And I think in that situation it'd be very safe.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:28.060]   Now you also need to think about, okay, what would happen if this cash were actually confiscated
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.060]   from me?
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:34.160]   Can I prove in a court of law where it came from such that I can get it back?
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.700]   Good chance that probably not.
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.200]   You can't prove it right now.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:43.560]   If this was your grandfather who 30 years ago sold a house to some guy for physical
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:48.320]   currency and he put the money into a safe or a safety deposit box at the bank, you probably
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.880]   don't have those records.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.200]   And so you would want to be very thoughtful about that.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:56.120]   And if it's a concern, you take these more heightened steps.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.180]   Now at the end of the day, I think it's still fairly safe.
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:02.640]   But if there were really a concern, then you would do multiple shipments, right?
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.080]   You would split it up.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:08.920]   Maybe you'd do $100,000 one time and $100,000 a second time.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.900]   And so that all of your currency is not exposed to one potential confiscation.
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:17.000]   I think the risk is very low if you do all the stuff I've described, but it does still
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   exist.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.160]   Now, can you fly with it?
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.360]   Absolutely.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.360]   You absolutely can fly with it.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.240]   So let me give you a couple of ways that you could do it.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:33.220]   I don't think I would because when you pass through the airport system, you are giving
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:37.600]   up your personal rights to privacy to a degree.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:41.080]   Generally this is not a problem, but you're generally giving up your personal right to
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.200]   privacy.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.960]   So if I were doing this, I absolutely would keep it on my person.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:50.680]   And I have flown with significant amounts of cash, never $100,000 or even $50,000, but
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.720]   I've flown with tens of thousands of dollars of cash.
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.860]   And it's not that big of a deal.
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:49:00.520]   You do want to make sure that you find a way to secure it in your effect so that it's safe,
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:04.200]   so you don't just leave it somewhere, leave your bag somewhere accidentally.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.160]   But generally speaking, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.160]   Why?
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.140]   Well, the time when you're most vulnerable is passing through a security checkpoint.
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:18.800]   But the TSA officers who are examining the security, who are studying the security thing,
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:23.560]   they're looking for bomb making, things that look like bombs, explosives, firearms, or
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:24.560]   edged weapons.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.320]   They're not looking for paper.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:30.760]   So you can have just a stack of paper, and a stack of paper looks like a stack of paper.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.300]   And as long as there's no other indications, the X-ray machine is not going to have any
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.680]   problem with it.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:41.640]   They say there's drug residue on basically all physical currency.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.380]   I doubt that that's a real concern.
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:46.920]   And so I think that you're fine traveling with it.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.400]   And the time at which somebody is most likely to see it, it really doesn't matter.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.340]   In addition, TSA agents are not police.
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.480]   They're not in the business of, in the United States.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.880]   Maybe in some other countries they're in the business of confiscating money, but in the
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.720]   United States they're not in the business of confiscating money.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:07.080]   And so there's nothing illegal about having it, but you do have a greater concern because
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.080]   it does exist.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:13.220]   Now, if you had some kind of history in your past, let's say that you had a warrant out
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:18.200]   for your arrest or something like that, then absolutely that would be completely unacceptable.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:24.680]   It would be unacceptable because you have reasons to be brought to a police officer's
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:25.680]   attention.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:30.040]   But me personally, I mean, I guess I'd be a little nervous at a hundred grand, but I
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:34.320]   wouldn't bother me too much to travel with 30, 40, 50 thousand dollars.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.440]   And I would just look like the kind of person who had reason to have 30, 40, 50 thousand
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.440]   dollars.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.520]   I would secure it in my personal papers.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:44.520]   I would make sure that it is in my bag, in a bag where it doesn't have to be opened up,
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:51.080]   kind of with stuff dumped into the bin exterior and just can be transported.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.080]   I wouldn't try to hide it.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:56.480]   I don't try to hide it when I travel with currency.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.760]   I want to make sure it's in a wallet, so it looks like it's a wallet.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.480]   And so in that situation, I would have like a passport wallet with a zippered compartment
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.560]   where it's very clear that it's just sitting there.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.560]   This is cash.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.360]   And the TSA agents probably in many cases know what it is.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:15.240]   In the past, I have flown with things like travel money wallets, money belts, et cetera.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:18.700]   Everyone knows, they know it's cash, but their job is not to find people with cash.
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.960]   Their job is not to be the IRS.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.880]   Their job is not to be the customs officials, et cetera.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.240]   That's different at an international border.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.720]   At an international border, when you go through a scanning device, there you have a customs
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:32.800]   agent and it is the customs agent's job to identify the cash.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.040]   Now could you fly with it in checked luggage?
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.800]   Obviously this would be a kind of a foolish thing to do, but there are times, at other
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:45.800]   times when you may have other things that you need to, that are valuable like cash that
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   you can't bring with you.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:51.320]   And so what I would encourage you to do in that situation in the United States is to
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.760]   fly with a firearm.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:52:00.440]   So there is a way in US law that if you want to fly, you can fly with a locked suitcase
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:07.440]   and not one of those stupid TSA locks that every single security agent has access to
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:11.980]   and anybody who has a 3D printer or anybody who can go online can just simply download
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:17.180]   the schematics and file your own little key out of a piece of aluminum foil.
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:25.520]   So if a suitcase has a TSA lock on it, that suitcase can be opened by practically anyone.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.500]   It adds virtually no security whatsoever.
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:33.400]   You can buy all of the keys to those TSA locks easily online.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:39.360]   But what you can do is you can put on a proper lock on your suitcase if you fly with a firearm.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:44.940]   And so let's say that you needed to travel from Pennsylvania to Florida with the cash
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:48.720]   and you wanted to, or with something else, again the cash I think should be on your person,
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.240]   but you wanted to travel with a locked suitcase.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.240]   How do you do that?
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.640]   The answer is you fly with a gun.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:57.520]   Because the way that the law works on flying with a gun is you go to the airline, you need
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:03.680]   to have the gun unloaded, and it needs to be in a locked case.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:09.300]   Now a lot of times you can see people fly with a visible gun case, but there's no clear
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:14.920]   requirement by the TSA on the specifics of that locked case, other than it has to be
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.240]   a locked case.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:24.080]   And by law, the lock must be a lock that the security agent does not have the key to.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.080]   That's the law.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.240]   I'll get to the actual practice in a moment.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:30.620]   But the law is that you have to travel with a locked case the security agent does not
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.160]   have the key to.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.640]   So in this situation, the way it works is you go to the counter, you declare your gun,
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:41.760]   you say I'm flying from Pennsylvania to Florida, I'm flying with a gun today.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:47.120]   You need to go and you need to demonstrate to the airline agent that the gun is unloaded
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:51.300]   and that the ammunition is held in a separate box case and the gun is unloaded.
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.560]   Then you're supposed to be conducted to a private security checking.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.440]   So you have an agent that does a private security scan, verifies the firearm, then in the presence
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:05.360]   of the security officer, you close the case, you lock the case, and then the bag is sent
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.040]   through checked baggage.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.320]   That's the law.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:14.040]   And then that bag cannot be opened again by law until you're at the other end.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:19.200]   Now what happens when people do this is about half the time, the security agents will want
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:23.600]   to open the bag again and they wind up cutting the lock off with the bolt cutters or cutting
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.100]   the case apart to get into it, etc.
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:32.200]   And so while that is the law, the law seems to be very poorly applied in most circumstances.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:36.480]   And many times when people travel with guns, they wind up having their cases opened and
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.980]   their locks tested.
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:41.360]   But if you're traveling with things, right, where you have a bunch of electronics, you're
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:46.780]   traveling with 30 iPhones or something like that that you have to transport to an event
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:48.640]   or a bunch of computers or etc.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.800]   This is your secret, is fly with a gun.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:51.940]   Now here's what's interesting.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:55.720]   There may be times where you may not actually want to have a gun.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:00.480]   You might be flying from Florida into JFK, right, and you're going to be in downtown
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.360]   Manhattan, and your destination is in Manhattan.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:09.440]   Well that would be, in Florida you might be fine with your Glock 19 that you carry all
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:13.160]   the time, and if you were flying from Florida to Texas, then of course you'd have your Glock
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:15.280]   19 that you could carry in Texas and in Florida.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.840]   But that's very troublesome in Manhattan.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:18.820]   So how do you fly with a gun?
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:25.320]   If you read the TSA regulations on what is characterized as a gun, it includes a number
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.320]   of important pieces.
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:31.920]   So the key ones are replica pistols are often characterized as a gun.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:37.480]   So if you have some kind of stage replica, not the kind of stage replica that Alec Baldwin
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:42.200]   might be holding and playing with and shooting people with, but rather a stage replica that
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.280]   doesn't actually accept ammunition.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:48.160]   You can do a starter pistol, and a starter pistol won't accept live rounds, but some
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:52.880]   kind of stage replica will work, and that can often get around the rules of a very restrictive
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.600]   place like Manhattan.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:56:00.640]   In addition, my two favorites are a flare pistol, so a flare pistol for like boating
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:01.640]   safety.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:06.280]   A flare pistol, even an empty flare pistol with no flares with you, that is legally speaking
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.360]   a gun.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:12.220]   And so if I were wanting to do that, I would have a flare pistol, bright orange safety
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:16.960]   flare pistol, no ammunition, so I don't have any explosives, and I would go up to the agent
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:20.320]   and I would say, "I'm flying with a firearm.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:25.240]   Here's the firearm," and the whole legal process applies, but you don't have to necessarily
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:28.080]   travel with your Glock 19.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:33.440]   In addition, kind of the final piece is you could take a modular firearm like an AR-15,
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:38.940]   and the legal firearm piece of an AR-15 is the lower, right?
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:43.680]   So you could just take an AR-15 lower, which is, for the uninitiated, simply a piece of
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.840]   metal that has a trigger assembly on it, but there's no barrel.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.080]   It doesn't accept a magazine.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.080]   There's no stock.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:53.480]   It's just a hunk of metal ground out, but it has a serial number on it.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:58.240]   Because that piece has the serial number on it, that is technically considered a firearm.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:05.340]   And so you could grab yourself a $30 or $50 lower, and that's a gun, and now you can use
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:13.400]   that gun to actually secure your suitcase and actually travel through an airport with
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:14.400]   it.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.520]   And so those are my tips.
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:20.240]   So I don't think you should do cash, but if other people have valuable items that they
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:25.080]   did need to actually run the risk of checking, those are some of the tips for you.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:29.600]   I would encourage you, though, not to check items that are valuable if you can possibly
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:34.000]   avoid it, because those who have done this and are doing it, again, frequently, even
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.640]   when the person uses high-quality locks, a high-quality locked case, et cetera, they
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:44.540]   wind up having their items opened, their locks cut off, their cases destroyed.
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:47.480]   Sometimes they can't get the locks cut off, and so they just destroy the case to get it
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.480]   open.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:52.560]   So you're not supposed to do that, but that's what is happening now when people are doing
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:53.560]   it.
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.860]   Finally, let's talk about mailing money.
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:59.200]   Mailing money is a really good way of moving money.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:06.260]   Now in this case, I would use the US Postal Service, not FedEx or UPS, because you actually
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:11.380]   have more protection from the US Postal Service than you do with FedEx and UPS.
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:17.680]   First of all, FedEx and UPS are spies for the US government, and they are charged with
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:21.040]   reporting anything that is suspicious to the US government.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:26.480]   They scan all documents, all packages, et cetera, and if they are aware of something,
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:31.120]   you grab a FedEx envelope and you put $100,000 of cash in the FedEx envelope, it's not going
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.420]   to make it to its destination.
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:36.360]   It will be referred to a federal agent of some kind for investigation, so you cannot
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.000]   use one of those.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.440]   But USPS is actually good.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:44.700]   First of all, there's good legal protections for the US Postal Service.
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:52.980]   Those legal protections are that it's only the Postmaster General and the US Postal Inspectors
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:56.080]   who are legally allowed to open mail.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:02.120]   One technique that you can do, which is legally speaking, if you have very important documents,
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:07.380]   and in this case, one of the tools that you could use, if I were flying with mail, is
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:18.780]   if you secure those documents in an envelope that is addressed, properly addressed from
[00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:26.000]   you to a recipient, properly stamped, some people argue that that mail is protected even
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:32.860]   from search by law, from search by regular police officers, et cetera, because legally
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:36.380]   speaking it's supposed to be the Postmaster General and/or the Postal Inspectors who can
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:38.860]   access the contents of that mail.
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:41.820]   I'm not aware of ever having that having been tested.
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:44.660]   I don't know if that's ever actually been tested, if anyone's ever sued it.
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.740]   I just know that technically speaking, that's a little loophole that I've read about that
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:52.380]   is supposed to be in case, and if I were flying with $100,000 cash, I would make sure that
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:57.860]   that's probably one of the wrappers that I put on the cash to protect it for all the
[00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:59.860]   reasons that I've just said.
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:05.460]   But beyond that, the point is that mail that's in transit is secure.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:07.820]   Now would I send all of it in one envelope?
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:13.400]   Absolutely not, but you can very easily, even just sending $100 bills, you can pretty easily
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:18.060]   send a couple thousand dollars in first class mail and it's really reliable.
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.060]   It's pretty good.
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.380]   So in that situation, what do you do?
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:24.180]   Well you make sure that you cut out, remember mail's going to be scanned and it's going
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:27.980]   to be scanned both by the US Postal Service machines in the United States.
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.020]   By the way, a couple of quick things on mail security.
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:34.500]   In the United States, all mail is scanned and those scans are saved.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:39.620]   So you have the sender and the recipient of all mail is scanned and stored in a database.
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.100]   And then in addition, the actual envelopes are scanned.
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:46.300]   And if there's some reason why the Postal Service has a reason to open your mail, they
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.380]   can do that.
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:52.520]   And then of course, the mail could be scanned by somebody individually who's trying to steal
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:55.780]   from a mailbox.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:59.580]   Your aunt receives her social security check in the mail.
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.740]   Somebody knows that the social security check arrives on the first of the month, opens it
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:03.740]   up.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.740]   It's a social security check.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:07.020]   People have had their mail stolen for years.
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:11.900]   But within those constraints, if I were wanting to send $100,000 across the country, you just
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:16.300]   take it out and divide it into say $3,000 or $4,000 a piece.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:19.060]   That's not that big a deal with sending $100 bills.
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:25.180]   Wrap it up in torn out pages from a magazine, put it in a security envelope.
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:28.060]   Probably good to do this spread out over a period of time.
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:31.580]   Probably good to make sure that you're sending it to someone with a secure mailbox, not just
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.240]   sitting on the street.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.260]   But you can easily send thousands of dollars back and forth by the mail with just bills
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:40.980]   in between magazine pages or whatever, and it's very safe.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:45.460]   And so you might want to use a couple names, couple addresses, etc. if you have those available,
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.420]   or just do it over a period of time.
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:50.460]   But I think that's a very reliable way to do that.
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:57.940]   I learned all that from JJ Luna, who being a privacy aficionado, he believed very strongly
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:04.380]   that to send, he wrote a book on how to hide your money, your cash, whatnot.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:08.980]   And he believed very strongly that the best way to move physical cash was just simply
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:09.980]   with the US mail.
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.740]   And I've tested it and it works fine.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:12.740]   It works great.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:19.080]   So those are probably more than you expected, John, but those are my pieces of advice on
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.080]   how to do it.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:26.880]   I guess for sake of completion, I would simply add that in many cases it may be better for
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.020]   you to choose something other than physical cash.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:37.140]   And so there are financial systems that some people have, I forget the specific name of
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:42.760]   it, but basically let's say that somebody is sending remittances.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:50.160]   I've used this to get money into places for relief work that we couldn't get money in
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.160]   other ways.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:54.900]   And I wish I could remember the name of it, but there's a specific name for it.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:59.640]   But the idea is in many cultures, let's say that I'm trying to send money into a place
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.240]   where that money is not being accepted.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:06.980]   I'm trying to do something that is morally right, but legally wrong.
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:12.080]   So I'm sending money and food and medical supplies to help people who are in need, but
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.080]   the government of a certain place says you can't do it.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.080]   What do you do?
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:21.780]   Well, you find somebody who has a family connection or a friend connection in that local place.
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:25.280]   And so you go to the person, let's say that you're in the United States, you go to the
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:29.000]   person in the United States that has a family connection there and you say, "Here, here's
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.240]   $50,000 or $5,000."
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.000]   And that person says, "Okay, I'll take the $5,000 of cash."
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.320]   Then that person speaks to their family member who's in the restricted country or restricted
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.620]   place and says, "Okay, I've got $5,000 cash.
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:48.540]   Go ahead and give the intended recipient the money."
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.880]   And obviously they're going to charge money for it.
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:54.520]   Usually it's quite steep, 20%.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.240]   You might pay a 20% fee for the conversion.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:02.920]   But this allows you to actually transfer the money from one place into another place without
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.680]   having to physically send the money.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.840]   There's no physical transfer of money.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.900]   There's no even digital transfer.
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.320]   The money never changes.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:15.400]   It's just held in the accounts based upon the honor and the relationship of those people
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.400]   involved.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.860]   And so the guy in the restricted country knows that he's got a $5,000 credit with his family
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:23.240]   member living in the United States.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.440]   So that's another system that can be used in situations where you have to do it.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:30.040]   But I don't think that any of that is practical to your needs.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.040]   So there you go, John.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.040]   Hope it helps.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.040]   John Ligato: Yeah, I appreciate it.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.040]   Thank you very much.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:39.040]   It's as thorough as I expected it to be and very, very much on brand.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.040]   Thank you.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.840]   Dave: We're on brand for radical personal finance.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.840]   Exactly.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.840]   All right.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.840]   Two other callers.
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.080]   Two, six, seven, eight.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.080]   Welcome to the radical personal finance.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.080]   How can I serve you today?
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.560]   Joshua Steinberg, CFO Alphabet and Google: Hi, Joshua.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:56.840]   I have questions about designing a sovereign lifestyle that really fits in well with your
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:00.720]   how to survive and thrive during the coming economic crisis course.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.360]   Dave: Okay, great.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:05.640]   Joshua Steinberg, CFO Alphabet and Google: Basically, I want guidance on inexpensively
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:12.400]   living in Florida and then Asia for the next few years, waiting for assets to appreciate
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:18.400]   with the current COVID restrictions and inflation expectations.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:24.040]   And quick background is basically six months ago, I fell down the Bitcoin rabbit hole.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:29.800]   It really gave me a deep understanding of the legacy financial system in addition to
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.800]   Bitcoin.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:35.120]   And I currently have 565,000 in Bitcoin.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:39.840]   300 is in a traditional self-directed IRA.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:46.120]   75,000 is in a Roth self-directed IRA, and then 190,000 in taxable accounts.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:54.200]   So I am currently doing a Roth conversion on that 300,000, which will result in me owing
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:06:00.320]   an additional 105,000 this coming April 15th.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:06.160]   For assets, I have a home worth 293,000 without a mortgage.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:11.000]   I'm currently downsizing the personal belongings in advance of the sale.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.560]   And then so 105,000 of that will go for the Roth conversion.
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:20.480]   And I'd like to use the remaining amount to live on for the next few years until the Bitcoin
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.480]   appreciates.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:31.200]   And in addition, there's 115,000 in gold coins, depending on how they are graded.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:37.920]   There's one very special Liberty head that could be worth $50,000, and the rest are St.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:43.960]   Gaudens or modern Olympic or American Arts medals.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:52.320]   And I have no 16, in addition, there's 16,500 in cash and no credit card debt.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:58.160]   And are you a single man or are there other family members living with you?
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:02.600]   I'm 51 years old, unmarried with no children.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:07.400]   The only physical limitations are a past lower back injury that prevents me from lifting
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.840]   heavy items.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:16.240]   And my 81 year old father who lives with me, he's in good health and he's joined me down
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.520]   the Bitcoin rabbit hole.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:23.320]   And whether I go to Florida or Asia, he wants to join me.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.720]   It's like we're looking forward to this together.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.920]   Awesome.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.040]   So I think this is great.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:36.200]   And so the idea is you want to live frugally for the next few years, not work, but live
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.880]   frugally while you wait for Bitcoin to appreciate.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.320]   That's the plan, right?
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:43.160]   Well, I'm not opposed to working.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:50.600]   I left my job in September, my job of 17 years in September.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:57.040]   Basically, if we're staying somewhere that's very low, low cost, I'd like to spend the
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:06.000]   time studying whether it's I've been looking into Salesforce admin certification, several
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.200]   of the IT certifications.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:13.440]   And just I generally like to learn more about Bitcoin and lightning and IT just to just
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.320]   to secure my own assets so they can't get taken.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:18.320]   Right.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.760]   Are you willing to live in an RV at least for a time or seasonally?
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:28.440]   That is not something that my father enjoys.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.440]   No.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:35.920]   And I'm a person we do enjoy Florida.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:42.160]   But when I went to Asia several times, it's like that really speaks to me.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:49.320]   It's the I apologize.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:54.720]   It's the the interest in social cohesiveness, the politeness.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:58.720]   I'm kind of a type B person, but very driven.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.240]   And it just spoke to me well.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:07.920]   So that that that is where I'd like, you know, that's where I ultimately want to live.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:13.720]   And the goal is to, you know, when the Bitcoin finally appreciates it, it'll be picking up
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.280]   the residencies and citizenships.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:20.480]   And ultimately, you know, I'd love to say goodbye to that U.S. citizenship.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.480]   OK.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:27.280]   When you think about going back and forth from Asia and Florida, is it important to
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:31.920]   you that you do it regularly, meaning you want to spend six months in Florida, six months
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.000]   in Asia?
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.600]   Or are you willing to spend longer amounts of time in one of those two places?
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.600]   Definitely not.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:45.040]   It would it would it would be I would see coming back to the U.S. when maybe, oh, we've
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:51.120]   been out there two years, maybe three years and we just missed missed the U.S.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:57.040]   I mean, the immediate thoughts were to move to Florida to establish residency there because
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:04.120]   current my current state has a state income tax, establish a mail forwarding service there
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:08.520]   and just get a small storage unit for for minimal personal belongings.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:13.680]   May or may not even keep the furniture and then decide what to do about the cars.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:22.920]   I mean, I would love to live kind of a permanent tourist situation for the near future just
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.840]   to see if dad's comfortable with it.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:32.080]   If if he if he's not, you know, we come back to the U.S. and at least then still have possibly
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.640]   the cars and the furniture and not have to recreate that.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.680]   But if but if abroad is is what's suiting as well, you know, next time we come back,
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:46.440]   it'd be just sell everything except for the essentials and have it in a very small, small
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.440]   storage unit.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.240]   And dad has Social Security income.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:54.400]   Does he also have other regular forms of income, such as other pension flows or investment
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.400]   flows?
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:56.840]   He does not.
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:03.040]   He has he has just his Social Security and a minimal amount of personal assets.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:11.360]   So the goal is is just for for him not to not to have to to to pay down on any of that.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:18.360]   And there were there were areas I know it's not open yet, but Dumaguete in in in the Philippines
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:23.880]   just seems like a nice it's a college town where food is inexpensive.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:28.440]   You know, housing doesn't appear to be bad and health care is affordable.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:34.200]   And it'd be a nice, nice springboard for Southeast Asia, you know, with with our eyes on, you
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:42.040]   know, in the long term, more of a Malaysia residency just just for the for the lifestyle
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:47.040]   and and and the fact that they don't don't tax your outside income.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040]   Right.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.040]   Right.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.400]   So let me walk you through this first.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:58.240]   I would encourage you at this stage, based upon what you have described at this stage,
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:04.440]   I would encourage you to spend to not worry too much about the paperwork of, you know,
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.400]   second citizenship residency permits.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.480]   Yes, we do need to pay attention to.
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:15.560]   But there would be little reason at this stage for you as a US citizen to take the very significant
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.480]   step of renouncing your citizenship.
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:21.480]   A few years down the road, yes.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:25.060]   And the yes, maybe is the question.
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:29.720]   The yes, maybe is based upon why do you need to renounce citizenship?
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:35.040]   If the question is tax planning, the biggest thing that you need to pay careful attention
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:38.880]   to, contrary to what you hear on the Internet, is that you need to pay careful attention
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:45.280]   to the fact that significant amounts of your personal Bitcoin investments are inside of
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.680]   IRAs and Roth IRAs.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.680]   This is not bad.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:50.640]   I'm not saying it's a problem.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:56.100]   What it means is that your tax planning considerations are very different than other people.
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:03.660]   And in fact, renunciation of citizenship for those assets when they're held in IRAs is
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.460]   not a good solution.
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:10.400]   And the reason is that on the day that you renounce citizenship, all of your assets are
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.340]   marked to the market and taxes are due.
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:18.740]   But there's a difference here between how your IRA and your Roth IRA assets are treated
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:22.780]   as compared to your personally owned capital gains assets.
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:28.460]   So let's pretend that I'll just add zeros to what you described of your asset mix just
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:32.480]   to make things interesting in terms of what you're hoping for and what you're anticipating
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:36.780]   could possibly happen with your Bitcoin holdings.
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:45.500]   Let's pretend that you were 55 years old and you had $3 million of Bitcoin in an IRA, $750,000
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:52.740]   of Bitcoin in a Roth IRA, and then $1.9 million of Bitcoin in a taxable account.
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:14:01.380]   On the day of your citizenship renunciation, you would incur $3,750,000 of ordinary income
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:06.980]   that is all fully taxable to you on your final tax return because the Bitcoin assets are
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:10.200]   held in your IRA or your Roth IRA.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:16.860]   So that would obviously be the worst possible thing that you could do, meaning to generate
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:22.760]   a taxable income of $3.75 million immediately puts you into the top tax bracket.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.880]   And then that's all ordinary income.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:28.000]   It's not capital gains income.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.720]   Now if you wait until you're 59 and a half and then you renounce income, that plan would
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.080]   be different.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:40.500]   So for example, at that point in time, your Roth IRA assets would be received tax free.
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:44.200]   And then if you continue to do Roth conversions, perhaps even by then all the money is in your
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.460]   Roth IRA.
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:50.240]   But at the moment, definitely you would not renounce citizenship.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:55.280]   And you would not renounce citizenship even if you have assets in the Roth IRA until you're
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.500]   59 and a half.
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:15:01.640]   Because if you renounce citizenship, all of the assets in the Roth IRA get turned into
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:06.640]   ordinary income, which is then fully taxable because it's not a qualified distribution
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.280]   from the Roth IRA.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:12.760]   And so it's a bad, bad move for you based upon what you're describing to be considering
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:15.940]   renouncing citizenship at this point in time.
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.760]   That may change after 59 and a half.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.700]   If you have not seen it, go to Nomad Capitalist channel and find the video that I did on Peter
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:30.200]   Thiel's $5 billion Roth IRA and how Peter Thiel could renounce US citizenship at the
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:35.640]   age of 59 and a half, take his $5 billion that's in his Roth IRA, and potentially, according
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:40.880]   to my understanding of the tax law, could potentially have that money income tax free.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:43.360]   Because that could in theory apply to you.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.160]   The challenge is you're 51 years old, and I expect that law to change within the next
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.280]   eight years.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:54.320]   But you should pay attention to it and see, because as you approach 59 and a half, if
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:58.800]   you complete these Roth conversions, such that virtually all of your Bitcoin, or at
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:04.920]   least all the Bitcoin that's currently in the IRA, goes into the Roth IRA, and if Bitcoin
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:11.120]   does do what you anticipate and does massively increase, then potentially you could follow
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:15.720]   the path that I described about Thiel in that video that I did for the Nomad Capitalist
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:18.480]   channel of the $5 billion Roth IRA.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.120]   So it's not something that you should ignore forever, but it is something that you should
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.660]   ignore for now.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:30.200]   You definitely will not want to renounce citizenship, as from my perspective, until you're 59 and
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.200]   a half.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:35.480]   And as an American, in your current asset structure, there's really no reason to renounce
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.840]   citizenship at this point in time.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.880]   There are enough other things that you can do that most likely you would be the guy who
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:46.000]   would be best suited for, yes, getting a residence visa for the Philippines or Malaysia or something
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.920]   else, but maintaining your American citizenship.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:55.400]   If you do wind up with massive increases in Bitcoin values, then what I definitely would
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:01.820]   do is I definitely would go ahead and purchase a second citizenship.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:04.040]   I mean, here, not today.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.560]   Today you don't have enough assets to make it the best move.
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:11.340]   But if you wound up with millions of dollars, then definitely I would purchase a Caribbean
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:15.980]   citizenship from one of the Caribbean Citizenship by Investment programs, so that you would
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:20.700]   be positioned to renounce, but don't go down that path right now.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:26.080]   There are some unique tax ramifications of your IRAs and your Roth IRAs that would make
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.720]   that plan a bad plan for you.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.740]   So let's go back from that.
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:32.740]   Just finish it out.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:33.820]   What could you get?
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:34.820]   What should you get?
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:37.740]   You probably should get a residency permit from a country in Asia that you would want
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:38.740]   to be in.
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:43.540]   I think here, definitely, the Philippines just redid the rules on the retirement visa,
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:47.660]   but I think the Philippines would be a wonderful place for you to start.
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:54.300]   I think that the Philippines, culturally speaking, is a very comfortable place for English-speaking
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:55.300]   Americans.
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:18:00.620]   I mean, the Filipino culture is just generally so pleasing for Americans.
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:06.520]   There's just a good cultural connection there, and the Filipinos are very nice.
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.520]   They like Americans.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.520]   They're very welcoming.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.440]   There's a good cultural fit.
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:15.060]   From a language perspective, the Philippines' English is so widely spoken that I think it
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:16.180]   would be wonderful.
[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:22.540]   From a cost perspective, it's very doable to live very inexpensively in the Philippines.
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:27.660]   You've got great tax benefits of the Philippines and a pretty easy residency program using
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:32.500]   one of their retirement visas, which certainly your father could get and you could get.
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.780]   And so I think that's a good place to start.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:40.420]   Malaysia, they've been dickering around with their My Second Home program, which was probably
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:44.180]   the world's best option and is now different, but they're fighting about it.
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:48.940]   So I think some time would wait to see, and they've been slower to reopen than the Philippines,
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.780]   so you may just need to wait on that.
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:54.020]   But I think that if you set up a base in the Philippines and then just traveled from there
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:58.060]   as a tourist, that could be a really good way for you to get to know more parts of Asia
[01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:00.820]   and see, do you enjoy more being in Dumaguete?
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:02.940]   Do you enjoy more being in Malaysia?
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:04.820]   Do you enjoy more being in Vietnam?
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:08.300]   I mean, it's just benefits of all of the above.
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.260]   So practically speaking, here's what I would say.
[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:15.860]   The reason I asked about the part-time part-time is you can save a lot of money and live very
[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:19.860]   well in Asia as long as you're not trying to come back to the United States every few
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:23.940]   months, because the airfares are generally pretty significant.
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:28.700]   I mean, you can find deals if you're willing to be, but basically it's a thousand bucks
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:31.580]   back and forth, and the flights are not fun.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:37.500]   You know, 16 hours, 14 hours, 13 hours, it's not fun to do those flights regularly.
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:42.040]   And so it's music to my ears that you say, "We want to try going to Asia and spending
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:46.380]   time in Asia and just be there, and then, hey, in a couple of years, if we want to come
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.100]   back, we want to come back."
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:52.340]   So what I would encourage you to do if I were in your shoes is I would store my furniture
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:55.580]   and my cars on Craigslist or on Facebook.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:20:00.980]   I would not store them in a locally rented storage unit, especially right now with the
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:03.060]   high values of used vehicles.
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.120]   Sell your cars.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.860]   No question, sell your cars.
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.540]   In addition, sell your furniture.
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:11.420]   Unless, I mean, most people, it's just not worth it.
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:16.240]   Those things should be sold, and you should store your cars and furniture in the form
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:21.500]   of cash, and just set it aside if you need to, or in your case, you'll buy more Bitcoin,
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:25.000]   but just set it aside and know, "Hey, I can always buy a car."
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.340]   Cars and furniture are easy, but yet having them will be one of the biggest frustrations
[01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:32.140]   to you personally.
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:36.060]   So when I got ready to travel the world, I did a few things.
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.740]   First, go through your personal effects.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.260]   I scanned my entire library.
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.300]   I scanned thousands of books.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:42.620]   You may or may not need to do that.
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.260]   In fact, I recommend you probably don't.
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:47.940]   It's a lot of work and a real hassle, and unless you make a living like I do from the
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:52.180]   knowledge that's in your head and you need the ability to pull up your books because
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:55.860]   your brain can see the page that you need to look at from time to time to remember something,
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:58.200]   then you probably just get rid of all that stuff.
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:04.280]   Get rid of all your personal belongings, except just a few mementos, et cetera, and get whatever
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:09.740]   is really, truly necessary, and be as minimalistic in your approach as possible.
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:15.000]   If you do this, it makes traveling easy, because what you haven't yet grasped since you've
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.740]   been living conventionally is that you can live very well, especially as two single men,
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:27.760]   you can live very well even just on short-term arrangements, short-term accommodations.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:34.760]   So when I'm traveling, even with four children, I basically plan, depending on where I'm at,
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:39.060]   I basically plan in my head that I'm going to spend $100 a day on accommodation.
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:42.960]   Now I'm traveling with four children and a wife, and we work from home, we homeschool,
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:48.000]   et cetera, and so I'm generally spending quite a lot more money than I used to when I was
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   a backpacker.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.400]   I'm staying in normal business class hotels.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:54.840]   I'm staying in upscale Airbnb apartments.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:22:00.800]   I'm not roughing it because of the family considerations.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:05.760]   But for a lot of people, paying $3,000 a month on rent is not, I mean, that's about what
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:06.760]   it winds up being.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:15.160]   And so I can travel with my family of four for more or less about $3,000 a month of accommodations,
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:18.860]   even just using short-term accommodations.
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:23.520]   Now you want to live frugally, and so if you're going to places that are generally less costly,
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:30.000]   places like the Philippines, places like Southeast Asia, you have access to a whole raft of hostels,
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.320]   guest houses, hotels, et cetera.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:37.100]   The nightly cost there, you can do very well at $30 or $40 a night.
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:40.280]   You can find budget options at $20 a night.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:45.120]   So if you traveled on a budget of $50 a day, you wouldn't be suffering as long as you guys
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.120]   are willing to embrace the adventure.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.460]   You can do $50 a day.
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:55.340]   You can do $75 a day total all in with accommodations, transportation, et cetera.
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:57.520]   And so that's the kind of budget that you can do.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:05.500]   If you give yourself $100 a day, $3,000 a month, maybe, again, depending on your personal
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:10.800]   constraints and how much you care about living frugally versus how much you care about living
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:16.200]   fancy, then you can do very well on that as long as you're not doing your plane tickets
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.720]   back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:24.400]   So I would dump the furniture in the cars, sell those things, and store them in the form
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:29.400]   of money so that wherever you wind up going, you can buy new furniture and buy new cars
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:30.400]   there.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:34.080]   And especially even in the case of a move to Florida, are you going to put your stuff
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.960]   in a storage unit where home is now in whatever state it is now?
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:40.880]   Well, if you do that, then you're paying storage unit there.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.160]   Are you going to drive it to Florida?
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.920]   You wind up paying truck rental expenses.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:49.440]   I mean, most people, if they're doing an out-of-town move, should probably get rid of most of their
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:53.400]   stuff, especially most single people, most flexible people.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.100]   The reason I'm articulating this difference is simply that it's different.
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:58.620]   You have different needs if you have a bunch of children.
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:00.080]   And so family needs are different.
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:04.240]   But in your situation, you and your dad should be able to live very simply and just simply
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.240]   go to Florida.
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:10.960]   And if you could get by with just a very small storage unit, with monthly rental of, say,
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:16.480]   $10 a month, a little 5x5 locker, something like that, stuff that you could fit into just
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:21.880]   a standard rental minivan or a standard rental car, then you're in the range at which it's
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.680]   no problem to keep that, to keep your mementos safe in a storage unit.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:26.880]   And then you're totally free.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.080]   And you can follow your interests wherever they go.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:34.560]   And this could be just the greatest adventure ever imaginable with your dad.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:39.240]   Because the two of you traveling together, you have camaraderie, company, et cetera.
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:43.200]   And this just, I can't think of a better way to spend time with my 81-year-old father than
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:44.580]   what you're describing.
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:47.560]   But you'll want to be light, as light as possible.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:52.180]   And so I would get rid of that stuff so that you don't have $200 a month of storage fees
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:54.680]   for stuff that, I mean, just imagine, right?
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:25:00.720]   If you're paying $200 a month for a big enough storage fee to store your furniture in a car,
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.520]   maybe, there's no way to ever recoup that if you're gone for two years.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.500]   $30 a month, absolutely.
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.500]   Do that.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:10.560]   If you're going to buy a 5.5 locker and put all your stuff in there, do that.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:13.680]   But don't do a storage unit for furniture and cars.
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:16.380]   >>Steve: Good, good.
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:17.440]   Do you have any advice?
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:23.560]   I've heard you speak about gold in the past, about how to get rid of the gold.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:29.920]   We've explored PCGS, but we don't know if we should mail it into them.
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.360]   Do we bring the good ones there to two of the events that are coming up?
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.200]   What's been your experience with gold in the past?
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.860]   >>AJ: I think that the question would be, do you want to store it and keep it in the
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:43.740]   form of gold, or do you want to try to convert your gold to Bitcoin?
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:50.020]   I would rather you not be 100% all in on Bitcoin.
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:55.220]   I feel like that's not the right plan.
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:57.900]   I don't want you to be 100% on Bitcoin.
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:58.940]   That's just foolish.
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:06.060]   Even the most bullish Bitcoin maximalist, being 100% all in, especially at your age,
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:10.340]   your father's age, et cetera, unless you have very marketable skills, which you're talking
[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:15.220]   about, educating yourself, I think it would be foolish to be all in.
[01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:19.780]   I would like to see you keep the money in the form of gold, and I would also like to
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:23.340]   see you make sure that you keep enough cash.
[01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:24.820]   I don't mean here currency.
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:30.300]   I mean working bank accounts, so that you could at least resettle yourself in the United
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:33.080]   States and get another job if you needed to.
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:36.600]   When you're traveling, you should have a resettlement fund.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.640]   You should have an amount of money that you've said, "Hey, dad, if I...
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:45.720]   Let's say that you go to Asia, your dad dies, and you're totally broke, and Bitcoin goes
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:47.680]   to zero.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:51.680]   You need to have a resettlement fund where you could move back to the United States."
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.760]   It's the single most important reason why you keep your US citizenship at this point,
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:01.120]   is because there is no better job market in the world for you than the United States.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:06.300]   If you came back to the United States as a US citizen, you can get any job in the world
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:07.960]   that you want.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:13.120]   But if you are not a US citizen, and there's a total crash of some kind and you need a
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.720]   job, you will have a very, very hard time.
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.800]   And while you might make it as a bartender at some beach bar in Dumaguete, Philippines,
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.660]   it would be a whole lot better for you to move back to where you're from, where you
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:27.560]   have a network, and get really any job, and kind of rebuild and get going forward again.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:32.040]   So keep a resettlement fund, keep an amount of money available to you where you can buy
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.020]   yourself a plane ticket back home from anywhere in the world.
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:39.920]   Keep a resettlement fund enough to get your first, last insecurity on an apartment.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.680]   Keep a resettlement fund enough for you to buy yourself a used car, to get yourself some
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.040]   furniture, etc.
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:50.700]   And keep a resettlement fund of an emergency fund that's big enough for you to have several
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:53.760]   months of living expenses so that you could find a job.
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:58.680]   And so if you imagine Bitcoin going to zero and everything falling apart, if you had,
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:06.300]   I mean, with those numbers, let's say 15,000 to 20,000 of cash set aside as like an emergency
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:10.520]   fund, a last-ditch emergency fund to get you home, get you employed, get a roof over your
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.120]   head, to me that would be the smart move.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:17.540]   And then on top of that, of course, you'll need your petty cash for traveling.
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:20.360]   But I would always keep that aside.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:23.120]   And then in this case, I think I would store my gold.
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:27.840]   I would find secure storage here, I think in your case, just a bank safety deposit box
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:28.840]   would work fine.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:30.040]   It gives you some protection.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:33.720]   As long as there's no legal risk that you have right now, then I wouldn't worry too
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.360]   much about the banking relationship.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:39.000]   Otherwise, you could sign up for private storage where there's no bank involved.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.880]   Do private storage on your gold.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:46.340]   Keep it set aside as kind of your return home fund as well, and then wait and watch and
[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:47.560]   see over the coming years.
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:53.840]   But I would do that before I would go and try to ship it.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:57.200]   Thank you so much for your guidance.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:02.680]   These are just the kind of problems that I, or questions that I see you come alive at.
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:06.560]   And this has been a long time coming.
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:16.080]   And yes, the podcast you did about Peter Thiel with Nomad Capitalist and Andrew Henderson,
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.960]   it's just keep doing what you're doing.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:24.760]   It's just you are speaking to that remnant and the ones who are out here and are listening
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:29.160]   are gaining so much from few other people.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:37.240]   I mean, I did initiate the Roth conversion actually just today after speaking with my
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:38.760]   tax man.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:46.720]   And he's an accountant, lifelong friend of my father's, and he actually had no clients
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:48.720]   who have self-directed IRAs.
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:53.760]   So I guess the more I absorb, I think that everybody else must be getting all this that
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.640]   I am, but I'm still that outlier and that weirdo.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:05.800]   Even given the changes that are harder and harder for everyone to ignore with the inflation,
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:13.160]   with the questions over there that quickly switch from taking the income of the rich
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:18.120]   to taking the wealth of the rich, and then changing the definition of what is rich.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:20.120]   It's just, it's scary.
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:23.480]   Yeah, I don't disagree.
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:28.080]   It's funny because we all get into our own echo chambers and then we think like, "Well,
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.520]   we're just like all of our other people."
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:34.840]   But when you look at the civilization broadly, all of our neighbors, like, "No, they're
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.760]   in their own echo chambers."
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:42.440]   But there are very few people who actually do this stuff, which is what many of the Bitcoin
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:43.440]   aficionados see.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:47.100]   They're like, "Well, this seems logically inevitable."
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:50.400]   And so it's just people are paying attention as people pay attention.
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.520]   Let me give you one last tip before I go on to my final caller.
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:56.040]   You mentioned moving to Florida.
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:59.680]   I think that that can work, but here's what I want you to know.
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:01.640]   First of all, you should check your state.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:05.720]   And if you're not going to be physically present, then in most states there's probably no reason
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:09.340]   why you have to actually move your residence to Florida.
[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:12.840]   Because if you're not going to be physically present, most states will exempt you completely
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:14.600]   from taxes.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:18.120]   Some states do not have those rules and some states do.
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:20.640]   I recently was looking at California, right?
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:25.440]   California does not have an explicitly stated thing such as, "Hey, if you qualify for the
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:28.800]   foreign earned income exemption because you're out of the United States for 330 days per
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:31.520]   year, we'll also exempt you from state income taxes."
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:35.160]   They still go based upon, "Well, we're going to look at all these factors."
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:38.680]   And so if I were living in California and going and doing what you're describing, I
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:45.160]   definitely would move from California to a free state such as Florida or Texas or South
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:50.620]   Dakota and move my residency to one of those states before going abroad.
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:52.720]   But that's not necessary with every state.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:58.160]   And the downside that you're going to face is that when you move your residency to Florida
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:02.560]   or to South Dakota or to Texas, and these are all three states that we talk about because
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.520]   they all allow nomad residents.
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:11.520]   They are no state income tax states and so they don't mind having people registered in
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.520]   their state as a resident who aren't paying taxes because they don't charge state income
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:15.520]   taxes.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:19.600]   They'd rather have more residents than fewer because it enhances their personal standing,
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.600]   etc.
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:24.860]   And so that's why these states are used by, say, full-time RVers as a place to set up
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:26.120]   a home base.
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:27.120]   You can do it.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:31.380]   But the problem is that there are some downsides that come with it.
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:34.240]   So things like credit card registrations.
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:38.800]   Your credit cards, you will have a hard time getting new credit cards if you register your
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:43.320]   address to a postal service in one of those states.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:47.400]   You will have a very hard time getting new bank accounts if you register your address
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:50.840]   to a postal service in one of those banks.
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:54.240]   Registering your address in one of those places is completely legal.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:58.920]   You can wind up with a driver's license that says your state of residence is Texas and
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:00.340]   everything is good.
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:04.800]   But the banks and the credit card companies are picky, which is one more reason why banks
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:07.760]   are zeros, right, to play the Bitcoin game.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:08.760]   And I don't mind it.
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:13.160]   But what you'll find is that those banks and credit cards are quite useful to you still
[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:18.760]   in the current world while you wait for the new world order with regard to currency to
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:20.120]   be created.
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:27.160]   And so what I would rather see you do is choose a trusted relative to simply move your affairs
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.160]   to.
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:31.640]   Choose a trusted relative and then you and your dad move your address to that trusted
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:37.740]   relative's home and register that as your address as long as you can look at the rules
[01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:43.520]   of your state and they might clearly exempt you from state income tax due to being abroad.
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:50.000]   The other thing that would be useful about it is that if you do that, whenever you need
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.080]   to handle administrative stuff, it'll be easier for you to handle administrative stuff, right,
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:55.960]   like renewing your driver's license.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:58.560]   And so you should do all of that.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:03.600]   You should renew all those documents as much as you can now.
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.760]   But if you need to renew your driver's license, if you don't know anybody in Florida and you're
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:10.520]   just going to Florida or just going to Texas to renew your driver's license, that's not
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:16.120]   such a fun trip back to the United States as it is going back home, wherever home was,
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.880]   staying with a friend, spending a few days, renewing your driver's license, getting new
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:22.480]   bank cards, et cetera, things like that.
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:27.000]   So just a thought for you is check the laws clearly.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:34.200]   In addition, just as Josh was moving abroad thing, lesson's hard one, okay, make sure
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.360]   your banking infrastructure is all set up.
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:38.780]   Make sure your credit card infrastructure is all set up.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:42.840]   Make sure your communications infrastructure is all set up, depending on what you're going
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:45.280]   to need there.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:50.720]   Otherwise, in the moment, there's no truly global option from the United States.
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:54.720]   So the only option that I recommend is that you have redundancy.
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:59.860]   So you might go with a Google Fi or a T-Mobile plan, et cetera, but they will both eventually
[01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:02.640]   cut you off if you don't come back to the United States and if you're using lots of
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:03.640]   data.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:06.740]   So they're a good option for you, but you should additional probably have a Google voice
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:11.880]   number and/or some other VoIP service as well, and then use your local SIM cards.
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:16.160]   You will want to move as many of your contacts and friends over to messaging services rather
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:22.680]   than phone calls, whether that's iMessaging, WhatsApp, Signal, Wire, Facebook Messenger,
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:26.520]   whatever email, whatever you're using, get them accustomed to speaking with you so that
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:29.040]   you can continue those relationships.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:35.120]   Also, from a practical perspective, before you leave, what you want to do now, especially
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:41.360]   for residency stuff, you need to go down and for both you and your dad, get about five
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:47.880]   to ten original copies of your birth certificate and have them apostilled by your estate.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:51.480]   So get your apostills done now and have those with you.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:56.280]   Additionally, I would encourage you go to your local sheriff's office, get about five
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:00.920]   to ten, I would encourage ten, but ten sounds excessive, I have ten of all this stuff, go
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:06.720]   and get ten copies of your fingerprint cards that you can send in for your FBI background
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:12.320]   checks, because with every residency application, you will have to send in a current background
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:18.440]   check for law enforcement, and that's really inconvenient to go and get fingerprints done
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.860]   in Dumaguete, Philippines and then send those into the FBI.
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:26.200]   So go and get ten copies of your fingerprint cards made for you and of your dad.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:30.120]   They may or may not always be accepted, depending on how your local sheriff's department dates
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:34.080]   those forms, but it's much better for you to have those and leave those with a trusted
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.080]   friend.
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:43.600]   So original apostilled birth certificates, extra copies of your FBI fingerprint cards,
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:50.600]   original apostilled copies of marriage certificates and/or divorce records.
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:55.080]   So you won't have apostilled copies of divorce records, but if either you or your father
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.960]   have been divorced, get the marriage certificate and then get the divorce records and have
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:01.160]   those.
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:06.080]   Transcripts can be useful, so call your alma mater, go ahead and order an extra sealed
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:11.360]   copy of your college and your high school transcripts, get those sent to and hold those
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.720]   somewhere with a trusted friend.
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:18.920]   And let me think, birth certificates, marriage certificates, divorce certificates, fingerprints,
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:22.600]   those are the main ones that you need.
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.560]   And then academic records.
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:30.680]   Then what you should do also is you want to work out a system with your bank for doing
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:31.680]   bank records.
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.680]   And this is also something you need to be careful of with so much money of your money
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.240]   in Bitcoin.
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:40.400]   Almost any visa program that you're going to do is going to require you to demonstrate
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:43.400]   a certain amount of income and/or a certain amount of assets.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:49.840]   And they're not going to accept the first three passcodes for your cold wallet.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.800]   They want to see money in a bank.
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:55.960]   And so especially right now when you have money in a bank, you need to be strategic
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:59.400]   with the sale of your house as to what you do.
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:03.200]   So you're going to want to see that money seasoned and in a bank.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:05.920]   And that's when you're going to want to do your residency applications.
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:09.680]   So sell the house, put the money in the bank, let it sit.
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:13.560]   Defer your tax bill for the largest amount of time.
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:16.800]   And this is the time when you need to line up your residency applications.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:22.520]   You'll get bank statements, and in some countries you'll need to get those bank statements apostilled.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:25.720]   This is a process that most Americans are unfamiliar with.
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:28.740]   They don't know, they've never had anything apostilled.
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:33.280]   So check your state, but the way it works in most states is you'll need to get a notarized
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:38.800]   copy of a bank statement or a letter from your bank saying, "Hey, we see that so-and-so
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:42.520]   has this amount of money and they've had an average balance in his account of XYZ or an
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:44.920]   average income of his account of XYZ."
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:48.800]   So you'll get a notary at the bank to notarize that document.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:57.120]   Then you'll take that document to your state, and the state will apostill the authenticity
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:02.360]   of the notary stamp, and that will be good enough for the countries that require apostilled
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.600]   bank records.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:07.880]   Some other countries have an automatic process of apostilling bank records, but the United
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:09.400]   States does not.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:16.440]   And so you'll need to understand how to get that notary signature apostilled so that they'll
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.760]   be willing to accept your documents.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:21.680]   And then just be careful with that, because that's going to be the key thing.
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:26.640]   If you wind up with $30,000 in a bank account and all the rest of your money is in Bitcoin,
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:30.520]   and then you got to try to go to apply for Malaysia's My Second Home program, it ain't
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:31.800]   going to work.
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:33.680]   And so Philippines, I think you can get it done.
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:38.880]   I think the Philippines is the best state place for you to start.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:42.600]   And then I would just tell you that you probably don't need many more residencies than that.
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:46.760]   If you're willing to move around, I would only worry much with a residency.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:50.920]   Most of those places you can do perpetual tourism, and as long as there's not a pandemic
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:54.080]   on, I think you're good to go with minimal residencies.
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.080]   So those are my thoughts.
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:40:00.760]   >>TED: Thank you for answering the questions that I didn't think to ask.
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:01.760]   That's awesome.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:06.200]   >>TED: Well, if you want to know how I learned all this stuff, it's been extremely expensive.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:12.280]   >>TED: Extremely expensive and hard-won advice.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.000]   I literally have had so many bank accounts declined.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000]   I've had to fly.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.360]   I've been back to the United States so many times to work out this stuff.
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:24.560]   And you do that enough times, you want people to have their problems solved first up.
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.480]   All right, we finish off the call in 360.
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:27.480]   Welcome to the show.
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:28.480]   How can I serve you today?
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:29.480]   >>ROJAS: Hi, Joshua.
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:30.480]   Thank you for taking my call.
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.480]   >>TED: My pleasure.
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:32.480]   >>ROJAS: This is Rojas.
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.480]   >>TED: Hi, Rojas.
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:40.600]   >>ROJAS: I have a question on when would be a good time for my wife and I to talk with
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:45.320]   you as far as a consulting call or take on a financial planner?
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:48.080]   And there's three sub-factors on that.
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:54.200]   I've already received so much good advice that I haven't used yet, and there's still
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.800]   so much I need to put into practice.
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:01.520]   So is it worth talking with someone more specifically when there's advice I haven't done?
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:04.400]   And also, our scale is still pretty small.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:13.480]   We're earning under $70,000, $80,000 a year, and we only have under $200,000 of net assets.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:16.640]   But we're not seeing the progress we'd like to see, or we're wondering, "Hey, could we
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:17.640]   speed things up?"
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:23.120]   Do you have any wisdom on how to view our scale and when to talk with an expert?
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:24.120]   >>TED: Yeah.
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:29.440]   So it's a good question, and obviously it's kind of a softball for me, but I will answer
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:34.360]   it with as much objectivity as I can.
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:44.840]   To begin with, if your $70,000 to $80,000 per year is wages, earned income from jobs,
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:51.800]   and if your $200,000 of assets are invested in the traditional ways, it's home equity,
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:57.040]   it's money in your 401(k) at work, some money in your bank account, et cetera, then there
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:06.160]   really isn't much that most financial advisors can offer to you that you can't do with self-education.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:07.760]   How do you reduce your taxes?
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.800]   You put money in your 401(k), that's it.
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:14.320]   If you're an employee, all you do is put money in your 401(k), and at $70,000 to $80,000
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:18.160]   per year, your tax bill is not that significant.
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.360]   There's not much you can do.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:25.520]   You can go and you can figure out, well, how do I enroll in the commuter credit so that
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:31.120]   my employer can give me the $120 a month of commuter credit, the money that's tax-free,
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:33.280]   but it doesn't matter.
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.240]   All that stuff really doesn't matter much.
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:37.380]   How do you save money on your taxes as an employee?
[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:40.560]   You put money in your 401(k), and you focus on increasing your income.
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:45.240]   Now, when you can get your income up, then things change a little bit, but the average
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:47.640]   financial advisor can't do much for you there.
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:55.160]   In addition, most of your investment products at this scale are not really that impactful.
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:43:02.200]   I don't know any financial advisor who makes a business of going around and opening $5,000
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.480]   Roth IRAs for people.
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.480]   There's no reason to do it.
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:09.600]   They'll do it for you as a convenience, but the whole time, they're gnashing their teeth,
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:13.240]   right, of like, "I've got to go and do all this work and print out 87 pages just to do
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.240]   a Roth IRA."
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:16.480]   It's just there's not much.
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:21.440]   Here I think at this stage of wealth and this stage of investments in the financial planning
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:24.440]   world, this is your best as a DIY investor, right?
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:25.580]   Open an account at Fidelity.
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:27.520]   Open an account at Vanguard.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:28.720]   Fund a Roth IRA.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:33.720]   Fund your wife's Roth IRA.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:36.040]   Put your money in your 401(k), et cetera.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.760]   This is a better solution.
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:42.080]   What you do probably need to do is talk to an insurance agent.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:46.440]   Here I think you can be helped by an insurance agent, but the insurance is going to be fairly
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.000]   straightforward.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.560]   At this levels of wealth, et cetera, you need some term life insurance if you want it.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:55.440]   You didn't mention children.
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:57.640]   People always say, "I don't need life insurance."
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:03.640]   I figure you should have some, so maybe you purchase five times your income of term life
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:04.640]   insurance.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:08.320]   Here, I think there's no reason not to use a proper insurance agent.
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:11.800]   Can you go online and buy it yourself through one of the websites?
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:13.040]   You absolutely can.
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:18.200]   The problem is you're not saving any money and you're just not getting any personalized
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:19.440]   advice.
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:25.000]   I think that you should talk to an insurance agent, just buy it from an insurance agent,
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.480]   so at least you can have a little bit more time and the agent will earn his commissions
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:32.240]   by actually spending time explaining stuff rather than doing everything through automated
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:33.240]   forms.
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:35.240]   How old are you and how old is your wife?
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:38.320]   >> Steven Rubinstein 30 and 25.
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:41.240]   >> Tavish McGrath So at 30 and 25, the other reason to talk
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:46.080]   to an insurance agent if you want life insurance is that you should be purchasing annual renewable
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:51.280]   term insurance, not level term, annual renewable term insurance.
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:58.760]   That's a more specialized product that is vastly superior from a financial planner's
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:03.760]   perspective but it's not widely sold nor is it widely understood.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:08.880]   I would call up Northwestern Mutual, a New York life agent, and I would buy annual renewable
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:13.480]   term from one of those companies and for there you'll actually talk to an agent because they
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:16.200]   don't sell that stuff on any of the websites.
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.760]   When you start to reach around 45, that's the point at which I switch to level term
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:21.880]   insurance for your term insurance needs.
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:23.760]   You'll also want to look at your disability coverages.
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:28.440]   If you're employers, employees, you probably have some disability insurance already in
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:33.480]   place with your employer and that's probably good enough or you might supplement it a little
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:34.480]   bit.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:38.120]   So I would talk to the insurance agent about disability income insurance as well.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:44.440]   But there's really not much more that a financial advisor can do for you at this scale of where
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:49.760]   you are, meaning that traditional, like a certified financial planner, etc.
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:54.600]   Now does that mean you shouldn't consult an advisor?
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.800]   My answer is no, it doesn't.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:01.300]   The key is to consult the right kind of advisor.
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:10.180]   And so I like to believe and I have proven many times that I am worth the money even
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:13.100]   for somebody who is just getting started.
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:21.380]   And so I firmly believe that if you pay me for a consultation, you go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult,
[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:27.100]   you put in your name, your information, and you sign up and book an hour with me, that's
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:28.220]   500 bucks.
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:34.580]   I firmly believe that I can give you in excess of a 10x return on the 500 bucks.
[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:40.660]   Because the key to implementing advice is not so much have I implemented all of the
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:43.660]   advice that I've been given.
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:46.060]   I have not implemented all the advice that I've been given.
[01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:49.020]   I have so many loose ends in my life, we all do.
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:52.580]   None of us ever do all the stuff that we'd like to do.
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:59.820]   The key is am I laser focused on the most impactful area of self-improvement or the
[01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:02.660]   most impactful things right now?
[01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:08.300]   And do I have I firmly looked at my opportunities and built a plan for them?
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:12.940]   And so if your household income right now is 70 to $80,000 and you're in your late 20s,
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:19.340]   early 30s, then your number one area of focus needs to be to 10x that income in the next
[01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:20.820]   decade.
[01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:25.620]   Because if you'll go from 70 to $80,000 of household income to 70 to $800,000 of household
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:30.940]   income in the next 10 years, then that will make more of a difference than ever.
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:34.660]   But how do you find the right advisor for that?
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:36.620]   I think that I'm pretty good at that.
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:43.540]   I can lay out the game plans for you, but realistically I don't know many people who
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:44.900]   do that.
[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:49.340]   And so that's the kind of thing where it's harder to get an expert's consultation.
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:54.900]   I think your best bet at this stage of your game is to spend most of your time and most
[01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:59.380]   of your money on books and make sure that you're regularly investing in books.
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:05.020]   And then as you sketch out a game plan towards your goals that you then invest into public
[01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:07.260]   seminars and/or classes.
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:12.180]   Right now we're going through an absolute revolution in web classes, et cetera.
[01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:17.620]   I can sit down and I can invest three days of time and three days of teaching into something
[01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:22.780]   and then I can afford to sell it for 200 bucks, 400 bucks, 600 bucks.
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:28.060]   And that's a much better use of your money is to spend your money on educational products
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:33.300]   that people that you're modeling or people you admire create for you.
[01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:38.220]   Best bang for the buck is going to be books in terms of the total amount of knowledge
[01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:40.060]   and ideas that you can acquire.
[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:44.580]   The problem is that books are super time intensive and they're usually not customized.
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:50.660]   And some of the most impactful stuff is simply not found in books because books are not current
[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:51.660]   enough.
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:55.900]   And so right now the revolution that's happening in the educational space where world class
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:49:00.220]   experts are creating their master classes and putting together seminars and you can
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:04.620]   buy it for a seminar, this is where the current cutting edge stuff is.
[01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:07.900]   And so that's where probably most of your time and money should be made.
[01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:13.020]   And then what I would say is that you can coach yourself.
[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:14.220]   You can coach yourself.
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:19.940]   The key is make sure that you have your priorities laid out and that you have done an analysis,
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:23.900]   an 80/20 analysis of those priorities and the pathway to get there to say what are the
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:26.540]   things that are the most impactful.
[01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:31.260]   And then look for the best teachers in that space.
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:36.460]   So I would be happy to do a private consultation with you.
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:39.260]   If you ever get to the end of a call with me and you say, "Josh, well that wasn't
[01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:44.140]   worth my money," then I'll return 100% of it.
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:48.660]   I 100% stand behind my work and I'm happy to return 100% of it.
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:51.660]   I've only ever made one partial refund to one client.
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:52.980]   Actually, sorry, that's not true.
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:53.980]   It's now two.
[01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:59.660]   I've had two partial refunds to a client out of hundreds and hundreds of clients.
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:05.020]   The first partial refund was from a guy who was doing some shady stuff and I spent most
[01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:09.980]   of the time yelling at him saying he shouldn't do shady stuff that I thought was morally
[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:15.420]   wrong and he didn't appreciate my using his time and he asked for a 50% refund.
[01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:20.860]   The second was I gave some wrong advice to a guy who was doing a Roth IRA contribution
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:21.940]   and I missed a law.
[01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:23.500]   I missed a technical thing.
[01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:27.820]   He wound up doing what I said and I had made a mistake and he wound up having a tax bill
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:32.980]   that was unexpected and had to spend money to unwind it and I made a dumb mistake.
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:33.980]   And so I refunded.
[01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:37.300]   I can't remember if it was all or partial, but I refunded his money.
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:38.300]   Those are the only two.
[01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:42.260]   I've never had someone, even young getting started guys making 30 grand a year, I've
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:46.500]   never had someone walk away from one of my consulting calls and say that it wasn't worth
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:47.500]   their money.
[01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:50.100]   So I'm here to serve if that would be useful.
[01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:53.140]   If you want the cheapest thing though, just stay a patron of the show.
[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:54.140]   Call in every Friday.
[01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:56.460]   I don't set a limit on how much you call.
[01:50:56.460 --> 01:51:00.020]   Call in every Friday and systematically week by week I'd be happy to talk you through as
[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:03.620]   public content, coach you through all the stuff that you're doing here on these Q&A
[01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:05.820]   shows and I'd be your best bang for your buck as well.
[01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:07.540]   Very helpful answer.
[01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:08.540]   Thank you Joshua.
[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:09.540]   Good.
[01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:14.540]   The only thing I would just say as we close is that you are doing the right thing by looking
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:15.540]   for the answers.
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:21.740]   The thing that is pretty astounding that so few people do is so few people actually spend
[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:23.940]   time looking for the answers.
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:28.660]   But if you will dedicate yourself to just looking for the answers, you'll figure out
[01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:30.460]   the advice to put into place.
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:35.460]   And then I'll tell you that over time you can figure out the lens of scale for yourself.
[01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:37.900]   You figure out, hey, what's meaningful right now?
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:40.300]   What works for me right now?
[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:45.820]   But I just would beg you that right now the goal of every – this is one of the reasons
[01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:49.700]   I left kind of the normal world of financial advice.
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:54.700]   The goal should be that you spend 80% of your time increasing your income and then saving
[01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:55.700]   that difference.
[01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:56.700]   That's it.
[01:51:56.700 --> 01:52:01.500]   The technical financial planning for someone in your situation is very simple and you don't
[01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:02.500]   really need an advisor.
[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:04.500]   The do-it-yourself world is so good, right?
[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:05.500]   We've got Vanguard.
[01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:06.500]   We've got Fidelity.
[01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:07.500]   You don't need anything else.
[01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:09.500]   You can go and open your own Bitcoin account.
[01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:12.500]   You don't need anybody else.
[01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:13.500]   Talk to an insurance agent.
[01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:14.500]   Invest a few hours of your time.
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:16.500]   The insurance agent won't charge any money.
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:19.700]   He'll just make a few hundred bucks a commission when you buy your life insurance policies
[01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:20.700]   and he's happy.
[01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:23.700]   And then you can go and do a lot of other things.
[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:26.700]   You buy your life insurance policies and he's happy.
[01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:28.100]   And so you don't need anything else.
[01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:31.540]   What you got to do is be laser-focused on increasing your income.
[01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:36.200]   And so if I were in your shoes, I'd be spending courses related to businesses that I thought
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:37.200]   would be interesting.
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.340]   I'd be buying Gumroad products left and right.
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:40.860]   I mean you should see my Gumroad account.
[01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:42.340]   You should see my Udemy account.
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:47.580]   You should see my – I got folders of all of the dozens and dozens of courses that I
[01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:52.020]   buy and whatnot because it's the best form of education.
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:54.300]   It gives you the ideas.
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:58.100]   And you see a payoff in spades in your own life and you want other people to have the
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:52:59.100]   same thing.
[01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:04.060]   So that's where I would be spending my time and my energy.
[01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:06.020]   Thank you all so much for listening to today's Q&A.
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:09.940]   Remember that if you also would like to talk to me and if you don't want to pay me 500
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:16.420]   bucks for that opportunity, then you can help me create public content here with Q&A show.
[01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:20.060]   To do that, go to Patreon, find the show Radical Personal Finance, sign up there and you will
