[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.800]   All right.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.880]   So we have a question here from Caroline.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.040]   Let's see what we got there.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.080]   So Caroline asks, how would you teach students
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.920]   not to buy into the hyperactive hive mind?
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.240]   She says, I work as a lecturer in academia in the UK,
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.520]   and the students we have are constantly
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.360]   emailing for support rather than finding out
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.760]   information for themselves.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.360]   So Caroline, typically my recommendation there
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.440]   is sender filters.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.360]   So that's an idea from my book, Deep Work.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.160]   But essentially, you have various communication channels
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.000]   that each come with a description of how
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.560]   they should be used.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.360]   And then you just give this information
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.040]   to the people that are going to be interacting with you.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.440]   So with students, I think this is quite straightforward.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.820]   You can be pretty clear about it.
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.600]   OK, for this type of question, this
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.600]   is how you ask it, for this, this is how you ask it.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.060]   This should happen at office hours.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.060]   This you can take me--
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.720]   I have 10 minutes right after class.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.920]   These type of quick questions, that's
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.520]   when you should ask me those type of quick questions,
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.240]   et cetera.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.200]   You just have clarity.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.040]   Here are the different ways to contact me or the staff.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.840]   Here are what you should expect and how it actually works.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.040]   The big fear people have is that, well,
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.500]   it's going to really annoy people.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.160]   They'd much rather have constant access.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.240]   For the most part, that's not true.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.840]   Clarity trumps accessibility.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.040]   That's one of the primary ideas behind a lot
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.080]   of my dealing with digital communications.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.440]   As long as I know how to contact you,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.520]   and it's not up in the air, and I'm not stressed,
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.600]   I need an answer, and I don't even
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.160]   know if Caroline's going to respond or not.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.440]   As long as there's clarity, oh, this
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.880]   is when I ask these type of questions.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.800]   Here's how it works.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.800]   Great, I don't have to worry about that anymore.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.960]   People tend to be OK.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.640]   Then you'll have 2% of people who will be mad.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.880]   But here's the thing, Caroline.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.480]   2% of people are going to be mad at you no matter what you do.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.800]   So you might as well get that madness in exchange
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.360]   for something really worth it.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.200]   So just be really clear for this type of communication.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.720]   Here's how it works.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.160]   When people go around that, you just
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.800]   push them back gently towards the thing
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.440]   that you've planned in advance.
