[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.040]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All The Hacks,"
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.440]   a show about upgrading your life and travel.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.760]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.040]   and today I wanna do a little 2024 planning.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.040]   I titled this episode, "What's in My Wallet,"
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.520]   'cause I wanted to take a hard look
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.400]   at all the credit cards I have,
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.440]   the ones I use, don't use anymore,
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.240]   and whether there are opportunities for new cards to fit in.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.760]   And I wanted to do that publicly
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.040]   'cause I thought it would be really valuable
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.860]   for you all to hear how I'm thinking about this,
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.180]   because I'm sure many of you
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.220]   are dealing with the same questions.
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.480]   The funny thing about the title
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.840]   is that I don't really carry
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.360]   what traditionally would be a wallet
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.240]   with all these cards I have in it.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.040]   I actually just use the Apple MagSafe wallet,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.920]   and I only carry two credit cards,
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.640]   usually my Amex Gold and my Capital One Venture X,
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.880]   unless I'm traveling,
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.720]   and I use Apple Pay for everything else,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.920]   or I store those cards in one password
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.300]   and use them online.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.360]   I'm gonna talk about a lot of cards in this episode.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.440]   If you wanna support me or the show,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.340]   please go to allthehacks.com/cards
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.860]   to check any of them out.
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.800]   It really, really helps, and I really appreciate it.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.580]   Before we jump in, I wanna kick it off
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.040]   with a story from a listener named Jake.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.660]   He hadn't really played the card game that much,
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.620]   but after listening,
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.420]   he'd been able to open up a handful of cards.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.380]   He wrote to me from a perfect day
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.960]   at the Hyatt Zalara in Montego Bay, Jamaica,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.220]   where he was able to use points for flights and hotels,
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.980]   and because the property was all-inclusive,
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.380]   all the food and drinks,
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.300]   as well as lounge access on the way down in Atlanta,
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.780]   which he said was not the greatest lounge in Jamaica,
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.140]   which was awesome,
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.220]   and got some free bags thanks to card benefits.
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.580]   He's got trips planned to Portugal
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.260]   and Argentina in the future.
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.720]   He said he couldn't thank us enough
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.100]   for everything we've shared.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.780]   So Jake, I'm so glad the trip was awesome,
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.060]   and I'm so glad you're doing what you love.
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.780]   Jake actually is a sommelier,
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.740]   and his wife pointed out
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.500]   that he was constantly helping people plan trips
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.580]   related to wine,
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.500]   and finally kicked off his own business
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.000]   called Terroir Tours,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.580]   where he leads food and wine tours
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.940]   through remote parts of Italy and beyond.
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.760]   I hope this new business goes well,
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.600]   and even more,
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.780]   I hope it brings you ample opportunities
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.500]   to earn more points on business cards.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.620]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.420]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact,
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.720]   and Trade Coffee is a great addition
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.260]   to your new year routine,
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.700]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.320]   Trade is a subscription service
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.020]   we've been using for over a year
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.060]   that sources the best coffee across the country
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.440]   and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.300]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.940]   so you can enjoy their craft
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.700]   from the comfort of your own home
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.860]   at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.820]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.140]   Sign up for a subscription
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.780]   or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.260]   It's been so convenient for us
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.140]   to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it,
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.380]   and over the past year,
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.200]   we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.640]   but this last bag of beans
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.320]   from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe,
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.600]   it's called Bark the Moon,
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.520]   and it's so delicious.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.680]   So jumpstart this year
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.660]   by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.960]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.800]   with select subscription plans
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.440]   when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.140]   That's allthehacks.com/trade
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.860]   for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.900]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.400]   All right.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.840]   So there are really three reasons
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.200]   that I think it might make sense to have a credit card.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.760]   First is how you spend.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.500]   So lots of cards earn bonus points on different categories.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.600]   So if you are spending a lot in a category,
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.080]   I think it can make sense to have a card
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.300]   that matches with that category.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.560]   So that's spending.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.880]   Second is perks.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.900]   There are some cards
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.240]   that the benefits of having that card far outweigh the cost,
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.920]   and whether you spend anything on that card at all
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.400]   doesn't matter because the perks are so great.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.560]   For us, that's the Hilton Aspire card.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.740]   Between the free night
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.480]   and all the credits you get with a card,
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.680]   it's totally worth the annual fee.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.960]   And if you wanna check that one out,
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.860]   it's not on our cards page,
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.960]   but you can use my wife Amy's referral link
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.040]   at allthehacks.com/hilton.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.280]   And then the third reason to have a card is the bonuses.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.060]   There are plenty of welcome bonuses
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.720]   that you can get for cards
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.680]   that may or may not make sense for you in the longterm,
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.760]   but that if the bonus is compelling enough,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.480]   I do think makes sense to get.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.200]   My threshold is usually somewhere
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.960]   in the 75 to 100,000 point range,
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.580]   though if it's a hotel card,
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.440]   I try to look for something even greater
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.060]   because those points are usually a little less valuable,
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.320]   except Hyatt, where if Hyatt had a 100,000 point offer,
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.200]   I would be jumping on it as soon as I saw it.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.960]   Also, and I'm recording this little part
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.200]   right after I recorded the episode,
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.400]   I just noticed that the Amex Platinum referral offers
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.920]   are up to 150,000 point signup bonus.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.440]   So if you wanna take advantage of that,
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.240]   I'll put my referral link up at allthehacks.com/platinum
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.880]   to all the hacks members that might have platinum cards
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.960]   with 150,000 point bonus there.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.240]   So in general, I want cards
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.120]   because they're gonna help me earn more when I spend,
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.640]   they have big bonuses, or they have a lot of perks.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.480]   Today, I'm gonna focus probably mostly on the spending side,
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.080]   but I will touch a little bit on the perk side as well.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.320]   Also, when I went through this process for me,
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.160]   there were a couple of goals I had.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.400]   One was I wanted to make sure
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.800]   I always was keeping my transferable points.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.000]   So that means that even though
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.880]   I might not need a particular card
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.920]   with a bank like Amex or Chase,
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.280]   I might wanna keep that card open
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.120]   just so I keep those points alive
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.240]   or find another card that will keep those points alive.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.040]   Few other things that are important to me,
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.400]   may or may not be for you,
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.280]   is to have at least one card with good rental car coverage,
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.580]   to maintain some lounge access.
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.360]   There are a lot of promotions I've seen recently
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.360]   where you get bonus for MasterCard.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.960]   So I wanna have at least one MasterCard
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.480]   because I have a lot of Visa and Amex cards.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.400]   I need a card with no foreign transaction fees,
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.640]   which is pretty easy.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.920]   And this year, I really wanna try
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.720]   to have more built points and status,
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.160]   but I will come back to that one.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.840]   Okay, so the first thing I wanna do
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.160]   is talk about how I review the cards I have
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160]   and my spending and try to pick cards that align.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.380]   So for me, fortunately, I use an app called Copilot,
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.720]   which makes it really easy
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.160]   to track all of my spending from last year.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.840]   So as I'm recording this, I've gone through 2023
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.440]   and I've looked at how much I spend
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.560]   in a lot of different categories
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.240]   and tried to figure out which ones I spend the most on
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.560]   so I can think about that.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.880]   So that was step one.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.200]   And I'll go through each individual category that I found
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.640]   and talk about the cards that make sense there,
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.640]   many of which I already have,
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.180]   and we'll go a little bit further.
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.440]   And to figure out the value of a card,
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.560]   there are a few things.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.920]   So first off, I have this card value tool.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.040]   If you go to allthehacks.com/cardvalue,
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.260]   I built this spreadsheet.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.360]   You can download it for as little as $1
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.520]   if you're interested,
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.060]   where I break down all the cards
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.680]   and how many points you earn on each
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.880]   and make it really easy to type in how much you spend
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.000]   in different categories
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.120]   and see how much adding a certain card
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.400]   would benefit to your points accumulation.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.040]   There's a whole video on that page
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.760]   so you can check it out before you have to make the decision
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.360]   but honestly, it's $1.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.520]   It was part of an experiment
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.760]   to make sure that these products are valuable.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.720]   So go through each card.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.560]   Dining was the first category.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.040]   It was a big spend for me.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.220]   I'm already using the Amex Gold card
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.080]   which earns four points per dollar, which was great.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.640]   But I figure as I go through these categories
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.560]   for people listening,
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.260]   it's also helpful to mention what my backups would be
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.180]   if I wasn't using that card.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.520]   So for Dining,
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.460]   while I think the Amex Gold at 4X is great,
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.620]   the Capital One Saver also earns 4X points on Dining,
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.980]   which is fantastic.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.620]   And the Citi Custom Cash earns 4X points
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.780]   but only up to $500 a month.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.620]   And then in the 3X Camp, there are so many cards.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.100]   You've got the Chase Reserve, the Chase Preferred,
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.180]   the Freedom Flex, the Freedom Unlimited,
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.180]   all four Chase cards and then the Built Rewards card
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.260]   which also gets three points on Dining.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.880]   So Dining, I feel like I have it covered.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.840]   I have a couple backup cards as well
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.940]   for anyone that doesn't take Amex.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.500]   So then I looked at Groceries
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.460]   and I don't spend more than $25,000 a year on Groceries
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.740]   so I'm in the clear with Amex Gold
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.860]   because you get 4X points on Groceries
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.420]   up to that $25,000 limit.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.940]   Additional to that, if you're looking for a card
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.320]   and that one's not a fit,
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.940]   the Saver card from Cap One gets 3X
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.540]   and the Citi Premier card also gets 3X.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.300]   I'm gonna focus on points earning cards
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.140]   but I'll talk a little bit about Cash Back later.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.340]   Next big category for me was Travel.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.620]   Right now I'm using the Chase Reserve to get 3X on Travel.
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.980]   Some other 3X cards include the Amex Green,
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.420]   the Citi Premier, which is 3X on Flights and Hotels
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.340]   but not all Travel.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.500]   And then there are a lot of cards
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.340]   that earn huge bonuses on Travel
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.920]   with the caveat that you need to spend them
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.700]   in the Travel Portal.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.060]   So for example, the Capital One Venture X
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.660]   and the Chase Reserve get 10X on Hotels
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.360]   and 5X on Flights when booked in their Travel Portals.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.400]   The Chase Preferred is also 5X on Hotels and Flights
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.800]   booked in the Travel Portal.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.980]   The Platinum card earns 5X on Hotels in the Portal.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.220]   And what's interesting about the Travel Portal
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.080]   is there are some downsides.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.620]   Doing a little bit of research for this episode,
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.240]   there are actually some upsides.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.100]   So I take that with a word of caution
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.580]   when I think about how much I can earn with Travel.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.620]   The obvious downside is that when you book
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.580]   through a Travel Portal,
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.740]   you're usually booking through an agency
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.820]   which means you have to deal with that agency
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.080]   to make changes.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.660]   We were taking a trip with a bunch of friends to Cabo
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.960]   and our flight was so delayed
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.020]   that everyone wanted to go take another flight
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.200]   and everyone that had booked through the airline
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.940]   and this was canceling a United flight
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.580]   to take an Alaska flight,
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.460]   everyone was able to very quickly and simply call United
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.700]   and cancel the flight because it was so late.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.100]   Except the people who booked it through a Travel Portal
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.540]   who needed to get Amex Travel to help out
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.060]   and it was a little tricky 'cause they'd already checked in
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.100]   and so I'm not actually sure to this day
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.960]   whether those people all got their refunds
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.300]   but I know they were trying.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.160]   So that's a big downside to booking the Travel Portal.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.220]   I've definitely used the Portal to book flights
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.860]   and it's gone fine but I just caution
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.580]   that if things go wrong,
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.460]   having booked in the Portal can create a few problems.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.300]   And also if you're booking hotels,
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.500]   there are some Travel Portal hotel rates
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.520]   that don't always accrue points
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.300]   so that's another thing to keep in mind.
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.260]   However, I was very surprised
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.840]   when I was looking at an article that the Points Guy wrote
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.500]   which I'll link to in the show notes
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.980]   where they compared the pricing for flights
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.740]   booking direct and at the Portal
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.520]   and while sometimes Travel Portals were expensive,
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.340]   there were almost as many times
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.260]   where the Travel Portal was cheaper
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.660]   and that was something I was really shocked by.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.620]   So I can definitely tell you that when I'm going forward
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.300]   looking at expensive flights,
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.820]   I'm certainly gonna look in the Portal
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.580]   because there were times where flights
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.580]   were five, 10, 15, 20% cheaper
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.500]   booking in a Chase or Citi or Amex Portal
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.300]   than it was actually booking directly with the airline.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.040]   Though, if I remember correctly,
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.980]   I don't actually think there was a single time
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.740]   where booking in the Chase Portal was cheaper
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.180]   but Citi, CapOne and Amex
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.860]   all sometimes were a little cheaper.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.720]   All right, I'll also link to an article
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.940]   from the Points Guy about reasons to avoid
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.020]   booking for a Travel Portal if you wanna go deeper
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.140]   but I just wanna caution
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.360]   that when I'm talking about earning points on travel,
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.220]   I'm talking about earning points on any type of travel
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.780]   booked anywhere, not the Travel Portals.
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.020]   Separate from travel, I'll just highlight flights
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.020]   because I have a Platinum Card on Amex
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.280]   that earns 5X points on flights.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.720]   So I'm using that for flights.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.020]   I'm using the Chase Reserve on everything else.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.320]   Another big category for us was Amazon.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.740]   We have the Amazon Prime Visa.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.740]   It earns 5% cash back.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.520]   You guys know I love points
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.520]   but it's hard to turn down 5% cash back
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.540]   compared with earning two points
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.380]   which is the best I could do with any of the other cards
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.220]   I have.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.740]   The next is cell phone services.
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.260]   Since switching to T-Mobile and Mint Mobile,
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.220]   we've actually brought our household phone bills
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.580]   down significantly.
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.700]   So this didn't really make sense to call out
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.340]   except that we bought our cell phones through our carrier.
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.080]   So I bought a iPhone 15 Pro through T-Mobile.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.120]   So I actually put that entire charge there
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.960]   which was fantastic because there are cards
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.740]   mostly on the business category,
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.000]   the Ink Cash and the Ink Preferred
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.540]   where you can earn three to five points
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.320]   on cell phone services.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.400]   Unfortunately, this category is mostly focused
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.240]   on business cards.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.920]   So there aren't a lot of cards
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.160]   that prioritize this category to get bonuses.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.400]   So for most people with consumer cards,
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.400]   I would actually just focus on whichever card
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.560]   gives you the best cell phone insurance.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.320]   Next, we actually spent a lot of money last year at Costco.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.880]   And unfortunately, there isn't a card
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.600]   that earns more than 2% or 2X points at Costco.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.240]   Though I will get to one later that is surprising way
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.880]   to get a little bit more than 2X at Costco.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.580]   So we just use our Venture X at Costco to earn 2X points.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.020]   It seems like with every business,
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.360]   you get to a certain size and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.200]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.560]   and you have too many manual processes
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.760]   and there's no one source of truth.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.760]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers,
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.080]   37,000, 25, one.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.360]   37,000, that's the number of businesses
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.640]   which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.260]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.840]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.000]   streamlining accounting, financial management,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.240]   inventory, HR, and more.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.160]   25, NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.020]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.080]   close their books in days, not weeks, and drive down costs.

[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.780]   When I decided I wanted to go full-time on the podcast,
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.140]   I had no idea what it could turn into.
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.040]   But now we have a newsletter, a membership,
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.620]   we're organizing trips, and one day we might wanna open up
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.760]   a store online.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.360]   So if you also have business dreams in your future,
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.120]   you should absolutely be checking out Shopify,

[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.900]   And then the biggest category for us
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.760]   was actually the other category,
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.900]   and that's everything else we put our spend on.
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.720]   For us, it was all on the Venture X, earning two X points,
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.220]   though if you don't have that card,
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.960]   the Citi Double Cash also earns two X on everything.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.880]   Like a lot of cards,
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.120]   the Double Cash is marketed as cashback,
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.240]   but if you have a points-earning card with that issuer,
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.400]   you can transfer that cashback to points.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.920]   So in this case, you would need the Citi Premier
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.120]   to have the Citi Double Cash earn points
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.320]   that you can transfer instead of just cashback.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.000]   The other big card in this category
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.760]   is the Chase Freedom Unlimited.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.840]   Now, normally, it only earns 1.5 points per dollar,
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.260]   which is, in my opinion, not as great as earning two,
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.900]   but up until last week,
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.120]   there was the ability to sign up for an offer
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.660]   which would double your points
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.320]   on the Chase Freedom Unlimited.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.220]   So it was gonna earn six X on dining
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.080]   and three X on everything else for the next 12 months.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.500]   Downside was those extra double-matched points
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.480]   weren't gonna come until the end of that 12-month period,
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.720]   but the ability to earn three X points on everything
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.900]   was unbelievable, six X on dining, also unbelievable.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.060]   For anyone who missed out on that deal,
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.320]   you definitely should get subscribed to the newsletter
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.620]   because I sent a reminder out before it expired.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.900]   That's allthehacks.com/email
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.940]   if you're not already subscribed.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.660]   One more category that I don't use
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.580]   but really comes up a lot with listeners
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.060]   is the Gas category.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.860]   The Citi Premier at three X
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.880]   or the Custom Cash at five X is really your best option.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.620]   There are a few other cards like the Wyndham Earner card
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.840]   that earns a lot of points on gas,
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.800]   but the Citi Premier is one of the best at three X points.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.700]   And that Custom Cash at five X is great,
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.600]   but it is capped at $500 a month.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.940]   So depending on how many points you are
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.280]   or how many dollars you're gonna spend on gas,
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.380]   it kind of affects that.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.500]   And also like the Double Cash card,
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.120]   the Custom Cash card is a cashback card
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.700]   that can be converted to points
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.980]   if you also have that Citi Premier card.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.340]   So that's a little bit how I thought
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.140]   about all the main categories.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.740]   For anyone listening with a business,
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.460]   I'll run through this really fast.
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.180]   I basically went through that same list of categories
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.100]   for business and I just tried to figure out
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.500]   whether I had a card I could use.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.980]   So for travel, it was three X with the Inc Business Preferred
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.260]   for flights, there wasn't a great option.
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.700]   So that's where the fact that Amy and I
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.680]   both have a platinum card comes in handy.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.620]   I use one for business stuff and one for personal.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.580]   And then dining, I ended up just saying
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.940]   that my Chase Freedom Unlimited,
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.220]   which only earns three X on dining
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.420]   because I didn't take advantage of that offer
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.580]   because I already had the Freedom Unlimited,
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.100]   has kind of become my dining card for business
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.860]   to kind of separate things.
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.780]   For Amazon and everything else for business,
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.940]   we just use the Spark Cash Plus,
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.340]   which is earning two X on everything.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.220]   Though I would love to get the Venture X Business,
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.920]   I am not eligible because I have the Spark Cash Plus
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.020]   and I'm a little scared to cancel it
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.740]   and be not 100% certain
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.540]   that I could open up the Venture X Business.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.540]   So that's business.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.540]   Now I've gone through all these categories,
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.140]   then I thought let's go through all the cards I have
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.580]   and decide if they make sense to use.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.100]   And I think about this in two ways.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.300]   So one, depending on how much you spend on a category,
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.060]   earning more points in it might not make sense.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.380]   So for example, the Capital One Saver
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.460]   earns four X points on streaming.
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.060]   And I don't have a card that earns
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.980]   more than two points on streaming,
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.580]   but I don't spend enough on streaming
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.580]   to make those extra two points per dollar make sense.
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.180]   And so the way I would do the math there is
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.180]   if I spend $1,000 on streaming,
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.420]   I'm gonna get an extra 2,000 points.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:14.780]   So 2,000 points, but the cost of that card is $95.
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.000]   So what am I gonna pay for those points?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.820]   Well, if I'm paying $95 for 2,000 points,
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.340]   I'm paying 4.75 cents per point,
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.980]   which is really, really high.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.500]   So it doesn't actually make sense for me to get that card
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.680]   solely for the streaming category.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.020]   So as I'm looking at where I'm spending money,
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.860]   I'm definitely trying to see,
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.420]   oh, maybe I could get a few more points per dollar
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.780]   on a category, but is it worth the annual fee?
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.180]   Is it even worth the hassle?
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.300]   You know, there are categories
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.560]   where I might spend $500 a year.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.060]   And even if I could get more points on that category
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.740]   with a no annual fee card,
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.060]   it might not even be worth the hassle for a few hundred points.
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.500]   So that's one value.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.060]   And then the other is when it comes to premium cards
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.640]   that have a lot of perks,
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.500]   trying to figure out whether a card's worth it
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.580]   is often about a lot more than the points.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.860]   Take the Amex Platinum, for example.
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.420]   Yes, you can earn 5X points on flights,
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.680]   but you also get a bunch of perks.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.260]   So saying, can I spend enough money on flights
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.420]   that earning 5X points versus maybe 3X
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.520]   for whatever other card you have is worth it?
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.280]   And it doesn't make sense to say,
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.260]   is it worth it for a $695 annual fee?
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.320]   I imagine for almost everyone listening,
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.020]   it's not going to be worth it.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.580]   However, the Amex Platinum also has a ton of perks.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.140]   I think in the points and miles world,
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.620]   it's often been called a coupon book
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.080]   because of how many different ways
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.060]   that you can earn value from the card,
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.180]   whether it's SAX credit or airline credit,
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.300]   clear, global entry credits.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.040]   So I really like this premium card spreadsheet
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.340]   that the Frequent Miler team put together,
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.180]   where for every single card with a big annual fee,
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.380]   they itemize out every single one of those perks
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.540]   and they give their estimate of the value
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.260]   and then they let you put in your estimate of the value
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.220]   and then summarize it all on a tab.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.660]   So you're able to kind of go through and say,
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.220]   well, how much is a $50 credit at SAX twice a year worth?
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.140]   Push you to say, just because you spent $100 at SAX
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.180]   doesn't mean you saved $100.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.460]   Maybe you used it to buy some fancy Aesop soap,
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.140]   which is often what we do,
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.980]   which otherwise we would have just bought regular soap
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.740]   and it probably saved us $30 instead of the full 100.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.460]   So I love how you can go through that spreadsheet
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.700]   and see, are these cards actually worth it?
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.780]   How much do you value the bonus points
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.820]   you get in this category?
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.340]   So you can put that in as well.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.300]   I'll link to that spreadsheet in the show notes.
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.820]   So for us, I'll run through all the cards we have
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.460]   and just say what our takeaway was.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.100]   Chase Sapphire Reserve,
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.220]   gonna keep that for 3X travel.
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.540]   Chase Freedom Unlimited, we never use it.
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.780]   It has no annual fee,
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:50.740]   but I decided this year to make it kind of my segregated card
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.820]   for earning points at dining and restaurants for business.
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.300]   The Chase Freedom Flex, we actually have,
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.220]   it's kind of a wild card because it earns 5X points
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.700]   on categories that rotate every quarter.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.900]   So I can't tell you that this card
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.300]   will be valuable for you in the future
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.460]   because I don't know what it will earn points on.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.340]   In Q1, you can earn 5X points on groceries,
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.860]   I think gym memberships and some personal care spa services,
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.300]   but I don't know what it'll be for Q2.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.660]   So we're definitely keeping that, no annual fee,
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.580]   and those 5X points while marketed as cash back
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.300]   because we have the Chase Reserve end up being points.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.580]   On the business side,
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.220]   I actually noticed we had the Inc Unlimited card,
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.380]   which earns one and a half points per dollar on everything,
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.060]   but we don't really use it for anything.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.420]   And the Inc Cash card earns 5X points
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.380]   on phone and internet services.
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.420]   So I'm gonna product change that card,
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.380]   which is something you can do for any card.
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.820]   You can product change it within its group.
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:42.660]   So I can go and say,
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.660]   "Hey, can we change the Inc Unlimited to the Inc Cash?"
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.300]   At least as I'm recording this,
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.940]   there is also a $900 or 90,000 points signup bonus
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.740]   on the Inc Cash and Inc Unlimited,
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.380]   which I'll link to in the show notes.
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.540]   And as I said, also at allthehacks.com/cards
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.460]   are all the links to all the cards
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.500]   except for a few that I will call out.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.700]   I gotta decide, do I wanna just product change it
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.980]   or do I wanna open up another Inc Cash
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.900]   for that 90,000 point bonus?
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.460]   I'm gonna keep my Inc Business Preferred
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.060]   'cause I use that for travel for the business.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.620]   And then I'm gonna keep the Amazon Prime card,
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.820]   which I use for 5% on Amazon.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.740]   And then we have a United card
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.820]   that is my wife Amy's longest held card.
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.340]   And we're just gonna keep that one going
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.900]   because it helps boost her credit
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.260]   by keeping a really long credit history.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.220]   And I should say, I'm talking about all of these cards
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.740]   as if I have them all.
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.980]   Because Amy and I play this game together,
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.300]   we often have some of these cards are hers,
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.500]   some of them are mine, so we're not all carrying all of them.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.020]   Moving on to Amex, the gold card workhorse card.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.220]   It's my primary card I keep in my wallet.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.540]   Probably not necessarily because I put the most on it,
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.340]   but because dining and groceries are the purchases
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.180]   that I most often need a physical card for.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.140]   Next is the Amex Platinum.
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.220]   This is an interesting one.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.660]   We have two of them
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.300]   because there was a great signup bonus for them.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.700]   And we've held onto both of them
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.900]   because it's kind of made sense
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.660]   and we got some good retention offers,
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.300]   which I'll talk about in a minute.
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.940]   Going forward, I'm not sure if it makes sense.
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:13.860]   Now that Amex has removed the free guests
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.380]   into the Centurion Lounge,
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.980]   at least if Amy doesn't have her own card,
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:18.900]   she won't be able to go in.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.540]   So that could make it make sense to keep.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.820]   And like I said earlier,
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.740]   I think we might end up using one for business flights
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.380]   and one for personal flights to separate that.
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.980]   I also have the Business Platinum card,
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.220]   which we opened up this year
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:33.380]   for a massive 190,000 point signup bonus,
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.620]   which I don't think based on using
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.060]   that frequent miler premium card spreadsheet,
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.300]   I'm gonna get the value out of.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.460]   So that's not a card that I think I'm gonna carry
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.460]   past the 12 month mark.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.780]   We have two Bonvoy cards,
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.820]   a Bonvoy and a Bonvoy business card.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.380]   You know, the annual fee is worth about as much
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.900]   as the free night certificate we get,
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.980]   though they're a little tricky to use.
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.700]   The primary reason we keep these cards
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.820]   is because they earn 15 elite nights on Marriott each year.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.260]   And that means between the two of them,
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.220]   we're 30 of the 50 nights you need
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.860]   to get to platinum status.
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.700]   And three more years of earning platinum
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.220]   and we'll have platinum for life,
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.140]   which would be a great thing to hit for us
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.500]   because then we never pay for breakfast.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.620]   So we'll probably keep both of those open.
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.980]   Next on the hotel front,
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.780]   we have the Hilton Aspire card.
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.140]   Amy has it and it's such a great value.
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.500]   I might even get it myself
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.460]   just because the free night certificate
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.100]   at any Hilton worldwide,
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.260]   plus the resort credit,
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.020]   plus the airline fee credit,
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.860]   I think it pays for itself.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.460]   And then last, I have an Amex Blue Cash card
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.540]   from so long ago that I think maybe earns 1% cash back
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.540]   and nothing special.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.900]   I got it in college,
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.780]   but because it has no annual fee
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.340]   and it helps boost my credit score,
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.860]   I will keep it open.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.300]   In the Capital One camp,
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.060]   we both have a Venture X card
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.540]   because of the big signup bonus when it launched.
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.500]   I don't see any reason for us to both have it.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.180]   So I think this year will be the year
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.620]   that one of us cuts our Venture X card.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.500]   The $300 travel credit,
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.300]   plus the 10,000 points a year,
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.780]   make it a break even on the annual fee,
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.820]   but we don't really need it.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.620]   You can transfer all of one person's Capital One points
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.780]   to another person.
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.140]   And unlike some cards,
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.620]   you can actually do that to anyone.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.140]   It doesn't have to be in your household.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.900]   So we might probably just transfer
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.980]   all of our Venture X points to one of us
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.700]   and cancel the other card.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.620]   And then last, I have the Spark Cash Plus,
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.340]   which is a 2X on everything card, but for business.
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.500]   And I like to pair that with the Venture X
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.260]   so that I'm separating all of the everything else spend.
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.540]   If I can figure out a way to get that Venture X business,
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.860]   especially right now when it has a massive signup bonus,
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.380]   I think it's still 150,000 points.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.460]   I would love to.
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.340]   I got denied when I applied because you can't have both.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.380]   And like I said earlier,
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.300]   I'm a little nervous to cancel the Spark Cash Plus
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.220]   and then find out I couldn't get the Venture X
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:49.100]   and then be out of luck with a 2X card for business.
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.180]   Though, as I'm saying this out loud,
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.860]   maybe the strategy here, cancel the Spark Cash Plus,
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.620]   use the second Venture X we already have for business
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.540]   if I don't get approved for the Venture X
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.860]   after I cancel that card.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.940]   So somehow just talking about this aloud
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.500]   made me come up with a strategy that makes sense.
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.780]   And then the only other card we have,
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.100]   which isn't technically a credit card,
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.700]   is the Target debit card,
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.020]   which we're gonna keep for 5% off at Target.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.340]   There's no annual fee. It's not even a credit card.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.700]   So we'll keep that going.
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.300]   And if you don't have that,
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.020]   oftentimes throughout the year,
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.940]   they do bonuses where you get 40 or 50 or 100.
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.260]   I can't remember the exact amount
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.580]   of kind of free credit for signing up.
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.300]   There's no impact on your credit score
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.460]   'cause it's a debit card.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.260]   So definitely one, if you shop at Target a lot,
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.100]   that makes sense.
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.820]   Just wait till they're doing the promo,
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.900]   which I will probably put in the next newsletter
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.460]   the next time it happens for the Target card.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.060]   That would be the time to get it.
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.780]   So if you go through a similar process yourself,
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.020]   what should you do when you find out
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.500]   that you have cards you don't need?
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.580]   There's three things that you should consider.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.100]   The first one is find out
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.060]   if you're eligible for a retention offer.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.980]   And I guess maybe the first one is just do nothing, right?
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.300]   If it's a no annual fee card that you've had forever,
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.540]   even if you're not using it,
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:59.860]   I would consider just keeping it
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.100]   because it helps your credit score
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.620]   to increase the average length of credit history
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.540]   when it averages all the cards on your credit profile.
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.700]   So you could just keep it if it has no annual fee,
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.180]   even if you're not using it.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.500]   If it does have an annual fee
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.660]   and you don't wanna have to carry that fee every year
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.180]   because it's not worth it,
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.820]   step one, see if you can get a retention offer
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.460]   from the bank to make it worth keeping.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.940]   I've had the Amex Platinum retention offer once
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.940]   of a comped annual fee.
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.680]   I think one time I had a card
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.660]   where it was 30 or 40,000 points
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.780]   if we could spend a few thousand dollars on it.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.980]   So always check if you can get a retention offer
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.820]   that might offset that annual fee and make it worth it.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:40.240]   If not, many cards have the ability to downgrade
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.700]   within a product class.
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.900]   So the Amex Platinum can go down to the gold or the green.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.060]   All of the cards in the Hilton portfolio can be downgraded.
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.500]   And similarly, in a lot of other categories,
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.580]   the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Reserve can downgrade
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.500]   to the Freedom Flex and Freedom Unlimited,
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.780]   which is actually, we had Chase Sapphire Preferreds,
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.300]   downgraded to the Freedom Flex and Freedom Unlimited,
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.460]   and then opened up Chase Sapphire Reserve
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.380]   when that came out.
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.820]   So downgrade path is great.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.500]   Keep in mind with Amex and a few other cards
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.100]   that once you have a card,
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.320]   you're often not eligible for the bonus on that card.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.600]   So for some cards where the bonus is small enough
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.520]   or non-existent, it might make sense to downgrade.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.380]   But if there's a card you really wanna try
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.520]   to get a big bonus for,
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.680]   you might want to not downgrade to it
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.440]   because you might make yourself ineligible
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.880]   for getting that bonus.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.360]   Also, sometimes there are cards
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.600]   that aren't obviously marketed that exist
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.840]   that you can downgrade to.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.400]   So I didn't think there was a no annual fee United card
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.800]   back when I downgraded our United card,
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.580]   but there was, so it never hurts to ask.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.820]   A lot of times also you can do all of this through live chat
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.180]   or through secure messaging.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.500]   Sometimes the retention offers don't work well
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.380]   through kind of that secure messaging portal,
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.780]   but on Amex, I've had a lot of luck with them
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.540]   just live chatting, but you can also always call
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.020]   or look up the numbers for the retention departments,
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.820]   just Google Amex retention number or Chase, et cetera.
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.700]   And then the last option is to cancel the card.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.060]   If you can't get a retention offer,
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.620]   you can't have a downgrade path
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.940]   and the card doesn't make sense.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.860]   It could make sense to cancel it.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.660]   Only thing I'll share here is before you cancel it,
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.980]   if there is a lot of credit on that card
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.060]   and you don't wanna lose that credit,
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.140]   at some issuers you can transfer credit between cards.
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.640]   So I know Chase is pretty good about this.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.260]   So if you had two cards with a $20,000 limit
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.020]   and you wanted to cancel one, but you needed that limit,
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.820]   you could actually transfer all but 1000 to the other card,
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.180]   bringing that one up to 39,000
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.460]   and then cancel the card when it has a $1,000 limit.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.260]   As for when to cancel and go through this process,
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.220]   usually within 30 days of the annual fee posting
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.940]   to your account, you can still negotiate it.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.540]   Also, a lot of the ways that cards market
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.940]   and check for people taking advantage of offers
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.620]   is that you close the card within the first year.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.980]   So my advice is always let that annual fee post
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.780]   after one year and then figure out what you wanna do.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.620]   So instead of trying to cancel it before the fee posts,
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.300]   let the fee post and then decide
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.420]   whether you wanna cancel it.
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.060]   And you can usually get that annual fee refunded
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.380]   if it's within 30 days.
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.460]   Every issuer has their own set of rules.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.140]   You can search online and say,
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.800]   "Annual fee refund, Capital One Policy,"
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.280]   and find an article that explains
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.460]   what each individual issuer's policy is.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.860]   But within that 30 day window of it posting,
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.880]   not of the statement close, but the fee posting,
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.740]   you should be good on all the major card issuers.
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.440]   When it comes to our personal finances,
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.260]   Amy and I are making some really intentional changes
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.380]   with how we wanna spend in 2024,
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.100]   and we are so excited about it.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.200]   And what made that whole process possible
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.980]   is our sponsor today, Copilot,
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.580]   which is one of my all-time favorite apps
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.980]   that makes it seamless and easy to track your spending,
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.820]   and in the case of our 2024 plans, boost our savings.
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.060]   I've tried dozens of apps for tracking spending
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.380]   and managing your finances,
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.100]   and Copilot is the only one I keep using.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.100]   So if you're looking for a replacement for Mint,
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.400]   I think Copilot is the answer.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.320]   You can link accounts at over 10,000 institutions,
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.780]   and their AI-powered expense categorization
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.280]   is the best I've used,
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.640]   with custom Amazon and Venmo integrations
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.180]   to make it even better.
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.660]   You can completely design your spending categories
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.240]   and subcategories, and easily set up rules
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.480]   to automatically assign transactions to them in the future.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.880]   Thanks to Copilot, we have never had a better grasp
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.600]   on our spending and cashflow,
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.080]   which honestly has probably resulted in hundreds
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.000]   or maybe even thousands of dollars of savings each year.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.920]   So for the best app to track your spending,
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.920]   subscriptions, investments, and more,
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:41.200]   go to allthehacks.com/copilot on an iOS device or Mac
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.440]   to download Copilot and enter code HACKS2
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.320]   during onboarding for a two-month free trial.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.560]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/copilot
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.960]   and the code HACKS2 for a two-month free trial
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.120]   of my favorite personal finance app.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.280]   If you're like me, it's about the time of year
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.000]   that you have to start dealing with collecting
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.800]   all your W-2s, 1099s, and any other docs you need
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.440]   for this year's tax return.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.720]   Well, thanks to our sponsor today, Daffy,
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.980]   I never have to go digging through emails,
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.760]   desk drawers, or Dropbox folders
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.960]   to find my donation receipts.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.200]   Daffy is a platform and app I've been using for years
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.680]   that helps anyone manage giving to the charities
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.640]   they care about more efficiently.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.400]   And they do that by helping you set up
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.280]   a special tax-advantaged account
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.760]   called a Donor Advised Fund, or DAF,
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.520]   to set money aside for charity, have it invested,
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.560]   and give on your own timeline.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.120]   They also make it seamless to gift appreciated assets
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.200]   like stocks, index funds, or crypto.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.120]   And because it houses all your charitable contributions,
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.720]   you only have one place to go at tax time,
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.180]   and you can easily make sure you're maximizing
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.440]   one of the most generous tax deductions,
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.000]   charitable contributions.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.320]   Also, if you're raising money
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.440]   for a cause you care about in 2024,
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.360]   you have to check out Daffy Campaigns,
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.280]   which helps anyone set up a fundraiser in seconds.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.880]   I know because we used it last year
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.960]   to raise almost $20,000 for Charity Water
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.600]   to fund two water projects for communities in need,
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.400]   and thank you so much to everyone who contributed.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.680]   So, if you want a better system for giving,
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.000]   head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   where you can get a free $25
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.120]   to give to the charity of your choice.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.720]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/daffy,
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.400]   D-A-F-F-Y, for a better way to give.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.280]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.600]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.420]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:37.120]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.880]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.440]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals,
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.760]   so please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.000]   Okay, so that covered all of the process
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   I go through when I review cards
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.520]   and what I'm thinking about my cards.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.000]   But what I wanna do that I think is really interesting
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.840]   is talk about where to go from here.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.840]   So, what am I thinking about for the future?
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.120]   So, I've gone through this process.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.400]   This is what to do with my cards,
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.560]   but where were the gaps?
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.700]   What's next?
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.860]   Next, I wanna talk about where the holes are.
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.400]   What are the new cards that I'm looking at?
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.760]   What are the new things that I wanna add
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.520]   to my roster this year?
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.520]   So, first off, anytime there's a massive,
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.100]   new, exciting welcome bonus or a new card,
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.160]   obviously, I couldn't have anticipated that.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.520]   So, you can assume that that's gonna be exciting to me
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.800]   even though I don't mention it.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.760]   But as for cards that I know exist
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.160]   that I'm really excited about,
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.120]   the first one is one that as of January 1st this year,
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.240]   I strongly regretted not having the card sooner,
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.400]   and that is the BILT MasterCard.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.840]   BILT Rewards is notably
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.200]   one of the highest value point currencies
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.140]   by the Points Guy, Bankrate, and my personal opinion,
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.960]   because BILT Rewards allows you to transfer points
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.640]   to a lot of different airlines and hotel groups,
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.880]   but the big ones that I'm most excited about
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.080]   are American Airlines,
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.960]   which is not a partner of anyone else.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.200]   They have United, Air Canada, Air France,
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:01.880]   British Airways, Avianca, Life Miles, Turkish Air, Hyatt.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.240]   They've recently added Marriott and IHG.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.200]   And so, there's just so many options
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.680]   for what you can do with BILT Rewards.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.920]   But that's a reason to love BILT Rewards, the points,
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.360]   but there's so many other reasons to actually love the card
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.680]   and some really cool things BILT's doing.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.520]   First off, if you are a renter,
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.840]   the BILT card, in my personal opinion, is a must-have.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.080]   You earn one point per dollar you spend on rent payments.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.320]   And the best part is that even if your landlord
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.640]   requires a check or a specific payment portal,
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.280]   BILT can handle it as well.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.600]   So if you're spending money on rent,
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.500]   you have to check out the BILT card.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.040]   And like I mentioned earlier,
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.640]   BILT earns 3x points on dining, 2x points on travel,
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.400]   and 1x points on everything else.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.340]   But the really exciting thing is what BILT does on rent day.
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.440]   And that is what gives me so much regret
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.860]   for not having gotten the BILT card earlier.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.640]   And what BILT does on rent day
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.320]   is that all points are doubled.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.640]   So you get 6x points on dining, 4x points on travel,
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.560]   and 2x on everything else.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.300]   I have a couple people who've emailed me
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.800]   as all the Hacks members and said,
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.560]   "Hey, can you reset my payment date to hit on the first
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.420]   so I get 2x points with BILT?"
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.960]   Lots of people, time booking travel,
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.340]   time going out to dinner to hit rent day,
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.200]   but even better is the promotions BILT
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.000]   has been doing on rent day.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.120]   Each month, they've done an awesome promotion,
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.360]   but January 1st this past year,
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.960]   they did the best one yet,
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.960]   where they took three different partners,
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.960]   Air France, Virgin Atlantic, and IHG,
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.260]   and gave you huge transfer bonuses
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.900]   based on your BILT status.
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:34.920]   So any BILT member could get a 75% bonus,
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.480]   all the way up to Platinum BILT Rewards members
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.080]   got a 150% bonus.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.740]   That means that if you were gonna transfer 50,000 points
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.280]   to Air France, and you had BILT Platinum status,
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.300]   you would earn 125,000 points.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.860]   That is crazy.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.800]   I have not seen transfer bonuses coming from Chase,
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.900]   Amex, Citi, CapOne, for anything more than like 30%.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:02.500]   And sometimes it's 15, 20, 25, 30,
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:06.240]   but to get 75 to 150% is crazy.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.120]   Now, I didn't have BILT status at the time,
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.480]   and all I could think about was,
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.840]   I don't have three days to earn this status,
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.800]   'cause I believe they announced this promo
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.480]   three or four days before the first of the month.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.960]   And it made it my goal that in 2024,
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.600]   I'm not only going to make sure I have the BILT card,
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.280]   I'm going to be spending enough on the BILT card
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.480]   to earn status, so that the next time
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:32.040]   they have one of these monster bonuses, I am participating.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.600]   So I opened a BILT card, and my new plan,
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.720]   because I don't pay rent, is to focus on spending,
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.480]   travel, and dining, especially on rent days,
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.840]   when I can do 6X dining, 4X travel, and 2X everything else.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.800]   So that means date nights are getting shifted
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.180]   to the first of the month.
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:52.120]   That means I'll be booking travel on the first of the month.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.600]   And it means that any bill that I can pay
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.000]   at a certain day of the month,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.080]   I'm going to try to earn 2X points.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.680]   I don't know what kind of transfer bonuses
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.920]   are in store for 2024.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.680]   They're even half as good as the ones they've done last year,
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.660]   especially the one they did on the first.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.840]   I'm really excited.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.640]   And if you're interested in the BILT card,
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.600]   and you haven't yet signed up,
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.960]   I would greatly appreciate it if you do that
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.000]   at allthehacks.com/bilt, B-I-L-T.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.600]   The next card on my docket this year
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.440]   is the Delta Platinum card.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.120]   I got a mailer for a big bonus for the Delta card.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.400]   And you get free check bags, a companion certificate,
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.600]   and 15% off award bookings.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.040]   So it's something I'm thinking about.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.160]   Delta points are not the most valuable.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.760]   In fact, they might be some of the least valuable points.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.720]   So the welcome bonus definitely isn't enough on its own,
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.880]   but we do have a few Delta flights planned for this year.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.480]   And so the free check bags will help.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.560]   To the extent we book any of our flights
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.040]   using the few hundred thousand Delta points we already have,
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.900]   getting 15% off awards would be a pretty meaningful addition
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.200]   to the signup bonus.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.960]   In fact, if you get a hundred thousand points
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.240]   from the signup bonus,
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.720]   getting 15% off award bookings
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.020]   just makes those points go further.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.960]   And then finally, the companion certificate is great.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.600]   You don't get it until your first year is up.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.340]   So it's not something you can use right away
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.840]   until the card renews,
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.240]   but it is something that keeps the annual fee
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.000]   effective value down.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.440]   Next is a card that I, it's so interesting.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.920]   It's the Capital One Saver card.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.160]   And I just, every time I read about this card,
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.560]   I look at this card.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.720]   I just think it's such a great card.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.340]   It's marketed as a cashback card,
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.200]   but if you have the Venture or the Venture X, it's points.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.860]   And you're getting 4X on dining, entertainment,
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.500]   and streaming, 3X on groceries,
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.360]   and for most of the rest of this year,
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.720]   10X on Uber and Uber Eats,
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.480]   and you get a free Uber One membership,
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.440]   and it's only a $95 card.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.580]   I feel like it's such a good card that I should have it.
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.300]   And I just love talking about it,
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.880]   but it just doesn't fit with all the other cards I have.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.280]   The welcome bonus isn't that big.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.680]   It's $300 or 30,000 points.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.200]   And all of the categories that it earns points on
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.720]   are categories I'm already earning
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.340]   as many or more points on,
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.280]   except for entertainment and streaming,
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.960]   which I just don't spend enough
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.080]   to really make this a huge value.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.960]   But if you have the Venture X card
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.640]   and you don't wanna spread your points
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.920]   across lots of programs,
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.400]   I think this is a great companion to that card.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.960]   Next is the Bonvoy Brilliant.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.680]   Like I mentioned, I'm three years of platinum status away
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.240]   from having lifetime platinum.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.840]   You have to have platinum for 10 years
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.680]   plus a number of nights.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.540]   So if I can't stay at a Marriott enough this year
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.240]   to earn the nights I need
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.780]   to stack with the elite nights I get from my card
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.040]   to hit platinum,
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.240]   I may just shell out for this card.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.000]   It's a massive annual fee.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.160]   But for three years to lock in platinum status
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.040]   and get free breakfast at Marriott Properties for life,
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.680]   it might make sense.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.920]   If I get to that point,
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.200]   I'll definitely be waiting
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.520]   until we actually have a trip planned
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.240]   where the breakfast that we'd get
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.460]   would actually offset that cost.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.280]   So that's one.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.740]   A couple other ones that aren't on here
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:56.840]   that I was just thinking about
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.240]   and I thought it would be worth sharing my thoughts.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.840]   So one is City Carts.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:02.880]   When I look at this strategy,
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.760]   I'm like, I have no City Carts.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.480]   I talk about them a lot, but I don't have any.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.460]   And there are a few reasons.
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:14.000]   One is that there's not a lot of ROI for what I have.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.420]   The Premier Card is crazy.
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.340]   3X flights, hotels, dining, gas, and groceries.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.920]   But I already have those categories covered.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.360]   The Custom Cash is 5X
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.680]   on whatever category you spend the most on,
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.600]   but it's up to $500 a month.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.600]   So meaningful number of points you could earn in a year
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.040]   on those categories.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.480]   And then the City Double Cash is 2X on everything,
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.500]   which is comparable to the Venture X,
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.920]   but I already have the Venture X.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.680]   And so, look, if you wanna build that trifecta
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.440]   of the Premier, Custom Cash, and Double Cash in City,
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:47.280]   I think it's a really powerful group of three cards.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.280]   However, I have them all covered.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.640]   And the other reason could be, I don't have City Points,
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.080]   but right now, City Points transfer
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.800]   to all the same transfer partners
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.880]   as all of the other credit card programs
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.360]   I already have points in,
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.920]   with one exception, which is Thai Air,
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.040]   which doesn't really matter to me.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.480]   So again, if you wanna go to allthehacks.com/t,
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.160]   the letter T as in transfer, P as in partners,
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.080]   allthehacks.com/tp,
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.360]   that's where you can get a free copy
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.040]   of the transfer partner spreadsheet I have,
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.920]   and you can see where all the different programs
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.980]   transfer to.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:20.640]   But because City doesn't have any unique transfer partners,
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.720]   having City Points aren't really that valuable to me.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.960]   And if I'm not gonna earn more points,
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:25.840]   it doesn't make sense.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.200]   Honestly, I want one just 'cause I'm curious.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.640]   I wanna be able to see the card-linked offers they have
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.160]   to be able to share those with you,
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.000]   but not enough until something more interesting comes out.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.800]   So if something happens in 2024 from City, I'll be excited,
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.660]   but I'm not holding my breath.
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.240]   What I am holding my breath for is Wells Fargo.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.320]   And I know that sounds strange
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.940]   'cause Wells Fargo hasn't been talked about much
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.380]   on this show as a interesting card,
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:51.360]   but for one of their cards, the autograph card,
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.440]   they've announced that they will be adding transfer partners.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.280]   I have no idea
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.280]   whether those transfer partners are interesting.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.260]   I have no idea if those points will transfer one-to-one,
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.560]   but I'm just saying I'm interested.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.600]   And that's 'cause right now,
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   the autograph is a decent cash back card.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:11.360]   It's no annual fee and you get 3% on dining, travel, gas,
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.480]   transit, streaming, and cell phone services.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.840]   Not a bad card, but today it's just cash back.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.040]   And that's not a priority for me right now,
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.160]   but depending on what happens with these transfer partners,
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.480]   it could be super interesting.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.520]   And if somehow this card adopts built rewards
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.740]   as its transfer partner program,
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.600]   it'd be even more compelling.
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.320]   They've also announced that they're gonna launch
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.400]   a premium and better card.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.880]   It's rumored to be called the autograph journey card
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.560]   with a higher annual fee.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.460]   And honestly, when they've said it's going to be better,
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.140]   I assume that means it has to earn more than 3X
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:50.240]   on dining, travel, gas, transit, streaming, and cell phones,
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.000]   which is now sounding pretty interesting.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.780]   So I don't know what the autograph journey card will include.
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.140]   I don't know how much it'll cost.
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.880]   I don't know what the transfer partners will be
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.240]   and whether that'll transfer one-to-one,
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.060]   but if all those things line up,
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.320]   it could be a really interesting entrance
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.600]   to the point space,
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.140]   especially if like the Chase Reserve did
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:09.440]   and like the Venture X did,
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.260]   they kick this card off with a massive welcome bonus.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.680]   So stay tuned there.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.120]   One more card that's interesting
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.740]   that I don't think I've ever talked about on the show
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:21.400]   is the US Bank Altitude Reserve card.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.660]   Now, I won't go into a lot of detail
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.000]   and I'll explain why,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.400]   but what's interesting about it
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.520]   is that it earns 3X points on mobile wallet,
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.640]   like Apple Pay.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.560]   It also earns 3X points on travel.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.160]   Now, right now, those points are just cash back
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.860]   and there's no plans to change that.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.520]   So I don't really think of it as a points card,
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.440]   but those points can be worth one and a half cents
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.540]   either used to book travel
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.960]   or using this real-time rewards feature they launched,
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.560]   which I'll put a link to in the show notes
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.760]   of someone reviewing it, but it's pretty cool.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.180]   Essentially, you take a Uber or something
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.420]   in the travel category and after the fact,
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.440]   they let you kind of use your points to pay it off
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.160]   at that same 1.5 cent rate,
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.060]   which means you don't actually have to go
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.380]   and book everything in the portal
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.260]   to be able to get that bonus.
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.620]   That means that all mobile wallet payments
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.380]   are four and a half percent cash back,
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.240]   which is a lot.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.760]   And I started thinking,
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.060]   would I rather have four and a half cents cash back
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.860]   or 2X points?
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:19.700]   And then I started thinking,
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:20.760]   okay, well, what are points worth?
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.340]   I say one and a half to two cents is a great value,
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:27.580]   which means 2X points is only worth three to 4% cash back.
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.920]   So if I'm getting four and a half percent cash back,
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.020]   that's better.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:31.940]   And then I started thinking,
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.940]   okay, well, am I actually gonna use my cash back
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:38.180]   to buy these kind of really premium,
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.440]   aspirational business class trips,
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.220]   or am I gonna get caught up in spending that money?
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:44.060]   And then I started thinking,
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.580]   okay, well, a lot of times,
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.940]   American, Avianca, United, and a lot of airlines
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.460]   sell their points.
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:53.040]   And I started wondering if I switch to cash back
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.560]   and use that cash back to buy miles and points
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.800]   when they were on sale and then book trips,
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.820]   would I actually come out ahead?
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.280]   And so that led me down a path
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.960]   that I'm not gonna cover today,
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.400]   but I'm going to be doing an entire episode
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.520]   where I really try to make the case for cash back.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.280]   Not necessarily saying I'm gonna switch,
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.920]   but I wanna do a steel man argument
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.860]   for what it would mean to switch to accumulating cash back
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.880]   and kind of put a case out there for team cash back
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.960]   and what it could mean,
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.120]   taking into account everything I just said,
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.720]   the fact that points depreciate over time.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.640]   So stay tuned on that episode.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.800]   I will also cover a bunch of the cash back cards
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.200]   I don't cover normally.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.020]   And then one other thing
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:32.160]   that I'll probably include in that episode
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.400]   or I'll bring up in a future episode
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.160]   was something that Ben wrote in to me asking
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.360]   about a strategy he used with his Apple card
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.040]   to buy a MacBook Pro.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.520]   And on that card, he got 0% financing for a year.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.200]   And it made me think about a way
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:53.200]   to potentially earn more with 0% APR cards
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.780]   because we have a high interest rate environment.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.000]   So I haven't done the math to kind of process this out,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.260]   but the argument would be,
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.000]   let's say you're gonna go spend $5,000, right?
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.660]   You could put it on a card that earns two points per dollar
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.360]   and get 10,000 points.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.120]   And let's say those points are worth two cents.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.000]   So now you've got $200 worth of value.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.520]   But what if you take that $5,000
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.280]   and you go put it in a high yield savings account
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:21.240]   that earns 5% and don't pay that card off
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.880]   other than the minimum payments for the 15
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.860]   or whatever number of months you have,
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:27.560]   well, you might actually end up earning more than $200
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.740]   in interest.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.460]   Now that interest is taxed.
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:31.440]   So I haven't quite figured out
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.800]   whether the math would play out here,
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.780]   but it's definitely something I'm thinking about.
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.540]   And as I dig into this and think about it more,
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:38.840]   I will definitely share that
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.780]   because with high interest rates,
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.160]   if you can avoid spending money,
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.160]   it might be worth more than the points.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.100]   And there are also some cards that earn points
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.900]   and have 0% APR.
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:51.360]   So if you could find something that does that,
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.280]   then I think this could be really, really compelling.
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.300]   So definitely something I'm thinking about in 2024.
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.400]   All the things I just mentioned, obviously, are ideas.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.720]   I haven't committed to any of them
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.060]   other than the built card, which I've already gotten.
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:06.240]   That's one that I am so excited to earn status
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.140]   and find the next transfer bonus.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:10.760]   I think that's it.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:13.240]   I think that is everything that's in my wallet,
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.400]   what I'm doing with it, how I'm thinking about it,
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.620]   all the categories I spend money on
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.300]   and everything I'm excited about going forward.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.700]   I hope this episode was helpful.
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:22.860]   If I missed anything,
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.180]   or if there's something you want me to cover
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.500]   in a future episode,
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.920]   send an email to podcast@allthehacks.com.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.660]   I will read all those emails.
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.180]   I may or may not be able to reply to all of them,
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.540]   but they will definitely inform
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.220]   the future direction of the show.
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.500]   Also, allthehacks.com/cards are links to sign up

[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.300]   If you don't find the best deal, go somewhere else.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.580]   I want you all to earn the most points possible,
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.300]   but if you do find the best deal,
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:54.460]   would greatly appreciate you using the links

[00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.460]   2024 is gonna be an awesome year for all the hacks.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.340]   I'm so excited for what we can share,
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:04.740]   and I will see you next week.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:07.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.900]   (upbeat music)
