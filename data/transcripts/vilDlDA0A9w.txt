[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.120]   the chapter that we read at the beginning, which is the fourth chapter in the book of
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.400]   Joshua, reading again verses 21 to 24.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.760]   Verses 21 to 24 in the fourth chapter of the book of Joshua.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.560]   And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.480]   fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:46.560]   Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.360]   For the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.480]   over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.560]   we were gone over; that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord,
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.840]   that it is mighty, that ye might fear the Lord your God for ever.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.160]   Now I call your attention to these verses in order that through them, and by means of
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:28.760]   them, we may continue our consideration of this great and urgent question of the need
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.920]   of revival in the Christian church.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.520]   We have hitherto been spending our time in considering the hindrances and the obstacles
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.520]   to revival.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.440]   For obviously that is the point at which we must of necessity start.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.680]   But that is not sufficient, though we start there and realize that there are certain conditions
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.880]   and certain rules that must be observed always.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.660]   I say it is not enough that we stop at that point.
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.840]   We must go beyond that point, because if we do not, we shall end in discouragement.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.240]   Having examined ourselves, having seen the situation as it is, we see that the problem
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.760]   is surely and certainly one with which no human power is adequate to deal.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.040]   It is because so many fail to see that, that they still are bustling and busying with their
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.300]   various activities and organizations.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.720]   There is no hope until we come to the end of that.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.160]   The situation is such that man is impotent to deal with it.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.840]   And that is why I say we should rejoice in the fact that we can go on together this morning
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.800]   to look at this whole subject positively and a little more directly.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.960]   Now I would remind you again that there is no more important subject for the Christian
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:08.360]   church at this present hour than this very question of the need of revival.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.760]   I say there is nothing which is more important than this.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.080]   It is second to none.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.080]   And the greatest need of the hour is that the thoughts and the minds and the prayers
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.800]   of Christian people everywhere throughout the world should be channeled and directed
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.560]   into this matter of the urgent need of revival.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.120]   I am going to quote some words by a famous expositor in the last century called Albert
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.160]   Barnes, because they seem to me to put this thing so perfectly.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.920]   He wrote like this.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.800]   He said, "That day which shall convince the great body of professing Christians of
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:58.240]   the reality and desirableness of revivals will constitute a new era in the history of
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.440]   religion and will precede manifestations of power like that of Pentecost."
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.220]   I am certain that is absolutely right.
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.800]   The greatest problem confronting us in the church today is that the vast majority of
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:24.040]   professing Christians are not convinced of the reality and the desirableness of revivals.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.880]   As I have been frequently pointing out, this is a subject that has scarcely been mentioned.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.720]   Men and women have been so busy in other directions, they do not even think of it, still less do
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.840]   they pray urgently for it.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.760]   And yet, as Albert Barnes says, it surely is the most important and the most vital thing
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.160]   of all.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.960]   And therefore, anything that is going to help us to do that is something which is of the
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.640]   greatest value.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.920]   And one of the best aids that I know of in this respect is to consider the story of the
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.120]   great revivals of the past.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.480]   I know of no method which is so sure directly to focus our attention upon this than just
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.680]   to be reading and considering what has happened in past centuries.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.120]   And therefore, very fortunately for us, this particular year, 1959, is a very great help
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.680]   to us in that respect.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.760]   Here is a year which makes us think of 1859, a hundred years ago.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.040]   And therefore, we are reminded of what happened in that wonderful year in the history of God's
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.240]   people here on earth.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.160]   And therefore, it is a very good thing that centenary meetings should be held and books
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.960]   and pamphlets and articles should be published.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.880]   Because all this, I say, will probably lead us all to consider this matter once more and
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.200]   to look at it and to ask our questions.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.280]   Well, now, let us be clear about this.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.920]   We are not interested in all this merely from the historical standpoint.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.320]   Our interest must never be merely an antiquarian interest.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.640]   There is no point in reading revivals just for the sake of reading the history and the
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.640]   stories.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:19.800]   No, no, our motive and our interest must be to read and to study and to consider what
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:26.040]   has happened in the past in order that we may discover the great principles that underlie
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.980]   this matter.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.800]   In other words, that we may discover what it is that we should be seeking and praying
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.400]   for in our own day and generation.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.280]   It should be a utilitarian rather than an antiquarian interest and motive that should
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.640]   govern us.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:49.520]   In other words, what I am suggesting this morning is this, that we should make use of
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:56.340]   these books and pamphlets and articles and these meetings which are being held to celebrate
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:02.200]   what happened a hundred years ago in exactly the same way as God intended the children
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.560]   of Israel to use these twelve stones that he commanded them to take out of the middle
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.080]   of the river of Jordan and set up at Gilgal.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.920]   Now you remember this interesting incident, and I am calling your attention to it because
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:25.240]   it does seem to me to be speaking very directly to us at this present hour.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:32.160]   Here God did something unusual, something strange, marvelous, miraculous, as I shall
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.560]   be indicating.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.360]   He delivered the children of Israel, first of all from their enemies the Egyptians.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   He divided the Red Sea and they went through on dry land.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.640]   And here they are now, they have been in the wilderness forty years, and there on the other
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.720]   side of the river of Jordan lies the promised land of Canaan, the place they were looking
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.760]   for and longing for, the land of blessing, the land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.480]   What a contrast to the wilderness.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.520]   Well here they are, but the question is how can they go through?
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.840]   And they went through because God divided the waters of Jordan, and they went through
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.200]   again on dry ground.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.160]   And God, you remember, gave this commandment to Joshua, and Joshua in turn gave it to the
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.160]   people.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.280]   "Take out," he says, "twelve stones from the very spot where the priests stood as they
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.520]   held the ark.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.720]   Take out twelve stones and then set them up there in Gilgal."
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.880]   And why?
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:42.640]   Well the reason is given here in our text, that in ages to come when your children shall
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:48.880]   ask their fathers, saying, "What mean these stones?"
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.760]   Well then you'll tell them, you'll give them the answer.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.400]   You'll say, "These stones are here to commemorate the most amazing thing, the most amazing thing
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.800]   in many respects that ever happened in the history of your fathers."
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.480]   And you'll tell them the whole story.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.280]   You'll tell them what God did at the Red Sea.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.080]   You'll tell them what he did again at the crossing of the Jordan.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.800]   And the reason for all this is, of course, that all the people of the earth might know
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:21.520]   the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty, and that you yourselves might fear the Lord your
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.400]   God forever.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.360]   Now then, it seems to me that all that is happening this year is comparable to these
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   twelve stones that are there at Gilgal.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.400]   And our position is this, and my whole business as I preach on this subject is in a sense
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:45.640]   just to do this, is to create in you just this question.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.960]   What mean these stones?
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.120]   What is all this that you're talking about?
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.800]   What are these books and pamphlets?
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.960]   What are these meetings?
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.280]   What is this thing?
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.880]   We know nothing about this.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.440]   As the children were going to ask, "What mean these stones?"
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:08.280]   So I trust that the main outcome of this year will be to lead men and women to ask, "What
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:13.400]   is this, and what is it relevant to us?"
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.920]   Now then, let's face this together.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:23.000]   The thing that strikes us, of course, at once is that it is most extraordinary that this
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.320]   kind of thing should be necessary.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:32.160]   Wouldn't you have thought that with an event like this in their history, that there'd be
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.640]   no need to remind any generation of the children of Israel of this?
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.040]   Why it's such a remarkable thing.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.920]   The two incidents, Red Sea and Jordan, are such outstanding events.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.800]   You'd have thought that there'd never be any need to remind people in some visible, external,
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.760]   objective way of such things as this.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.960]   And yet, you know, God gave the commandment.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:03.280]   And God gave the commandment because he knows human nature so well.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.280]   What does he know about us?
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:11.420]   Well, what he knows about us is this, that it is simply amazing and astonishing to notice
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.680]   how easily we can forget.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.600]   Even a memorable event like this, I say, would soon be forgotten, would drop right out of
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.040]   the minds and the consciousness of subsequent generations of the children of Israel.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.280]   So put up the stones, says God, so that they'll be reminded, they'll be arrested, they'll
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.040]   say, "What are these stones about?
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.480]   What does this mean?"
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:38.640]   And then the answer will be given to them.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:45.360]   Now this is one of the first things that we all have to realize about ourselves, this
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.480]   tendency to forget.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:53.040]   Yes, to forget even the greatest and the most wonderful things.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.960]   It's true in every realm.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:01.680]   I suppose that one of the most devastating effects of sin in the last analysis is the
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:09.160]   way in which it thus puts a paralysis upon the mind and even upon the memory.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.260]   This isn't confined, I say, to religion.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.320]   It is true in every realm.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.360]   How soon are great men forgotten?
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   Men who dominated the scene in their day and generation, for subsequent generations, they
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.400]   mean nothing at all.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.760]   And if they suddenly see a monument, they say, "Well, who was he?
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.840]   What did he do?"
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:35.120]   Though these men did such astounding things in their times and their contemporaries thought
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:42.720]   that they'd never be forgotten, as time passes and other generations come, they're soon forgotten.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.400]   A generation arose that knew not Joseph.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:54.160]   There is nothing that is so transient as reputation in that sense.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.120]   But it's not only true of great men, it's true of great events.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:03.600]   Some of the most astounding events in history are soon forgotten.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.320]   And a generation arises that forgets all about the sacrifices of its forefathers, who may
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:15.600]   have fought even unto death for some great principle or for some great liberty.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.120]   Generations arise that know nothing about it and are really not interested in it at
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.120]   all.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.080]   They take all the fruits and all the benefits.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.920]   They never trouble even to ask, "How is it that these things have ever come to us?"
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.240]   Now, that's human nature, isn't it?
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.840]   That's human nature in every respect and in every realm.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.880]   What is the cause of this?
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.560]   And particularly, what is the cause of this in the realm of religion?
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.880]   Why does it become possible that generations will arise that will even forget a thing like
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.040]   this and God has to give his commandment about these stones?
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.960]   Well, I suggest some brief answers to you.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:14:01.600]   Perhaps the main cause is our absorption with ourselves and with our own particular age
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:09.200]   and generation, and particularly our absorption with our own activities.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.360]   We are so self-centered, so busy doing what we are doing.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.960]   We seem to be unaware of the fact that people lived in this world before we ever came here
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.280]   and past ages and centuries.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.720]   It's this morbid self-centeredness and self-concentration, what we are doing.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.800]   People's lives are bound entirely by their own circle and their own little activities,
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:38.120]   and how infrequently do they look out upon it?
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.480]   Curtains of various descriptions are not new.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:46.240]   There have always been iron and bamboo and various other curtains.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:52.480]   It is amazing to notice how small life can be, and we live this circumscribed little
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:58.280]   existence with our little activities, and we never look out beyond, and we are aware
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.280]   of nothing else.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:05.400]   And of course, then added to that, there is a feeling, which is particularly characteristic
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:14.640]   of today, that the past cannot possibly help us because of all our advances and all our
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.200]   wonderful knowledge and our techniques and our astounding abilities.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.560]   We are the masters.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.320]   What has the past got to say to us?
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.520]   There's a great deal of that, and it's been true, of course, of every generation before
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.040]   us, and it'll be true of the generations that follow us.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.080]   They look back at us, and if they do at all, they'll just dismiss us.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.340]   We were mere tyrants in these matters.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:43.440]   But I believe that in the last analysis, the explanation is this.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.480]   It is, I say, this subjectivism of ours.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:57.760]   And this subjectivism vitiates even our reading and our studying of the Bible.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.760]   Now what do I mean by that?
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.920]   I mean something like this.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:08.960]   We are all so morbidly concerned about ourselves and our own problems that we tend even to
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:14.600]   go to the Bible as a book which is going to help us with our problems.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.640]   It controls our reading of the Bible.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.640]   We want some help.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.920]   We want this and that.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.920]   And we go to the Bible, I say, as if it were some sort of dispensary to deal with the so-called
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.440]   mumps and measles of our souls, as Charles Lamb described them.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.720]   The approach to the Bible is so subjective, instead of being objective.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:41.480]   How often do we go to the Bible in this kind of way, saying to ourselves, "Well, now,
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.720]   I'm going to read the Bible because I want to see what God has done.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.160]   I'm going to read my Bible in order that I can look at God acting in history and intervening."
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.400]   What is the Bible?
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.080]   Well, the Bible is not just a book that answers my little questions and gives me this and
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.680]   that that I may want to need.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:05.960]   The Bible is the record of the activity of God, the manifestation of God, God's mighty
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.960]   acts and deeds.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.960]   I'm going to look on.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.440]   I'm going to stand back.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.320]   I'm going to see what God the Lord has done, that all the people of the earth might know
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.560]   the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.560]   The acts of God.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:27.340]   But, you know, I'm afraid we don't read the Bible like that any longer, do we?
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.120]   We want just a little word to help us.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.140]   We want a nice little thought to start the day.
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.800]   We want just something before we offer up our brief and hurried prayer, before we rush
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.800]   off.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.800]   Beautiful thoughts.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   Don't misunderstand me.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:45.940]   I'm going to say a thing that can be grievously misunderstood.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.800]   I verily believe that the main trouble of most evangelical people today is that they
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:57.040]   read their Bibles too devotionally, which means I say subjectively.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:04.240]   And this mighty panorama of the acts of the living God is something that we seem to be
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.060]   unaware of.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:13.460]   And the result is, you see, that we need to be reminded of what God has done.
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:17.840]   It's all here for us, but we pass by, we don't notice, so we've got to put up some stones,
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.820]   some memorial, something to arrest attention.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.100]   Now this is a principle which you find in many places in the Bible.
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.120]   Look at this communion service which is going to follow this service.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.120]   What's that?
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:34.320]   Well, it's exactly the same principle.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:41.720]   We are so dull and so stupid as the result of sin that we'd even forget the death of
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.800]   the Son of God for us, and his agony and his shame, and all that he endured on the cross
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.920]   in his eternal love for us, we'd even forget that.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:55.240]   For the Lord himself ordained and commanded that we should meet together and break bread
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.680]   and drink wine.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.680]   It's the same principle.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:04.040]   Do this as oft as he do it in remembrance of me.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.120]   It's the setting up of the stones in Gilgal once more.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:14.240]   We are such, I say, and we suffer so much from this fell spiritual lethargy that we
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.680]   need objective memorials.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.900]   We need tangible reminders.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.600]   We want something outside ourselves.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.560]   We constantly need something that will lead us to ask, "What means this?
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.840]   What means this table?
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.680]   What means these stones?"
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:37.220]   God condescends to our weakness, our lethargy, and our stupidity by providing us with external
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:43.400]   memorials of his own mighty acts and deeds.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:50.860]   And so it is, I say, that I for one thank God for 1959, simply because it happens to
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:55.960]   be a hundred years away from 1859.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:04.080]   Here is something that's pulled us up and makes us ask, "What mean these stones?
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.080]   What are you talking about?
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.520]   What are these celebrations?
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.120]   What is this series of sermons that you're preaching on revival?
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.120]   What's making you do this?
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.120]   What are you talking about?"
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.080]   And you're telling us about things that have happened.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.080]   "What is this?
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.920]   What means this?"
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:23.920]   Oh, you notice that I'm holding on to this point and I'm doing so for this reason.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.080]   This is the eighth time I've preached on this question of revival, and if I haven't
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.360]   either to succeeded in rousing you to ask this question, if there hasn't arisen this
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.800]   new interest and curiosity, I've preached in vain.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.120]   I mean by that that it's not enough just to listen to all this and to be aware of something.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.520]   Has this curiosity been aroused?
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.000]   Are we really becoming concerned as to what it all is?
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.400]   What does all this record?
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.720]   And I want to try to show you this morning and on subsequent Sundays, God willing, that
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:02.240]   the really complete answer is given in these verses here at the end of this fourth chapter
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.760]   of the book of Joshua.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.760]   It's all here.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.200]   God, you see, has given his own explanation, and I've got nothing to do but to hold his
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.360]   explanation before you.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.640]   What means all this, let me tell you.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:20.320]   First and foremost it means that we are reminded of facts.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.080]   What mean these stones?
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.120]   Subsequent generations are going to ask that question.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:31.000]   They'll be going along casually, perhaps out on a walk, on a journey.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.520]   Suddenly they see these twelve stones and they say, "Well, what's all this about?
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.520]   What's the meaning of this?"
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.440]   Oh, you'll give the reply.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:45.320]   Your descendants, says Joshua, will give the reply, "Oh, these stones are here as a memorial
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.960]   to something that once happened."
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.960]   History.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   Facts.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960]   Not theories, not ideas.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   Facts.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.960]   What means the bread and wine?
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   Oh, a fact.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.960]   That he was crucified under Pontius Pilate.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.960]   Our whole position depends upon facts.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.960]   I am not going to go into the details of this.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.960]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.960]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.960]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.960]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.960]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.960]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:07.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:43.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:50.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:25.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:32.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   I'm going to go into the details of the history of the world.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:16.440]   It's but one example, but one illustration of something that has been happening periodically
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   in the history of the Christian church right through the running centuries.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:27.440]   It's one example of what we call revivals, revivals of religion.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   And it's only one example.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   There have been many others.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.440]   Let me just give you a few illustrations in passing.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.440]   You know, long before even the Protestant Reformation, there was quite a religious revival
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:47.440]   in this country associated with the name of John Wycliffe and the Lollards.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:54.440]   That was a revival, as definitely as what happened in 1859.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:00.440]   Well, then, of course, you had the same thing on the continent of Europe, that great man
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.440]   John Hass or Hus.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:09.440]   There in Moravia, what is now called Czechoslovakia, there was a real revival associated with his
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.440]   name.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:15.440]   God used him as an instrument and a channel, an amazing movement of the Spirit of God.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.440]   You had it amongst the Wolvenzians in northern Italy.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.440]   It was a real revival.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.440]   It happened with that great man called John Taller, who was actually a priest and a preacher
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.440]   in the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.440]   The Spirit of God came upon him and it led to a revival in his area.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.440]   Same thing, exactly.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.440]   Then, of course, the Protestant Reformation.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.440]   Let us never forget that this was a revival as well as a reformation.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.440]   We mustn't think of that as being merely a theological movement.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.440]   It was that, but in addition, there was a revival.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.440]   The Spirit of God was shed abroad and people were listening to preaching.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.440]   It became everything.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.440]   And the reading of the Bible, that's a religious awakening.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.440]   That is what we mean by revival.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.440]   You get it in the seventeenth century.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.440]   You got it, of course, in an amazing manner two hundred years ago in the great evangelical
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:10.440]   awakening associated with the names of Whitefield and the Westleys and many, many others.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:17.440]   And then, I say, you had it in the early part of the nineteenth century, the close of the
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.440]   eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:27.440]   And then this notable, remarkable event which took place 1857 to '59 in America, Northern
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.440]   Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Sweden, and in other parts of the world.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.440]   Now then, this is but one illustration.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.440]   This is one in a series of things that has been happening throughout the long history
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.440]   of the Christian Church.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.440]   And you will find as you read the stories of every one of them that they share certain
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.440]   things in common.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.440]   They've got the same general characteristics.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:54.440]   He did it at Jordan, says Joshua, to tell these people exactly as he did it before in
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.440]   the Red Sea.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:02.440]   Certain general characteristics are common to all these experiences in spite of time,
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:08.440]   in spite of country, in spite of civilization, in spite of everything else.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.440]   Now then, what is this?
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.440]   What is this thing that happened a hundred years ago that falls into this series?
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.440]   What is revival?
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:26.440]   We can define it, if you like, by saying that it is a period of unusual blessing and activity
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.440]   in the life of the Christian Church.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.440]   Unusual blessing and activity.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:43.440]   Now, primarily, of course, and by definition, a revival is something that happens first
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:51.440]   in the Church and amongst Christian people, amongst believers.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.440]   That, I say, is true by definition.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.440]   You see, it is revival.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:02.440]   You revive something, and when you say that, you mean this, that that's something, that
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:08.440]   person had got life, but the life was beginning to wane and to droop and to flag and become
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.440]   almost moribund.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.440]   And some people had said, "Well, that's dead, that's finished," because they couldn't see
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.440]   much sign of life and of activity.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:21.440]   Revival, awakening, stimulating the life, bringing it onto the surface again.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.440]   Revival.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   Well, now, therefore, by definition, it is something that happens primarily in the Church
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:41.440]   of God and amongst believing people, and it is only secondarily something that affects
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.440]   those that are outside also.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:50.440]   Now, this is the most important point, because this definition helps us to differentiate
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:57.440]   once and for all between a revival and an evangelistic campaign.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:03.440]   I know of nothing that has done so much harm than to confuse these two things.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:08.440]   There is nothing which is indeed quite so idiotic as to see people announcing that they
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.440]   are going to hold a revival.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.440]   They mean an evangelistic campaign.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:18.440]   Alas, this confusion was rarely introduced by Finney, and it has persisted ever since.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.440]   But it is a gross misunderstanding.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.440]   It is a confusion of terms.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.440]   Let me show you the difference.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:35.440]   An evangelistic campaign is the Church deciding to do something with respect to those who
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.440]   are outside.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:46.440]   A revival is not the Church deciding to do something and doing it, but is something that
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:53.440]   is done to the Church, something that happens to the Church.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:30:00.440]   An evangelistic campaign is therefore mainly in terms of those who are outside.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:06.440]   A revival is mainly with respect to those who are inside.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:10.440]   The two things are essentially different.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:14.440]   You can have a great evangelistic campaign, but it may leave your Church exactly where
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.440]   it was, if it isn't indeed worse.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:23.440]   I add that for this reason, that I am being told so constantly that the Churches are suffering
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:29.440]   from what is called a post-evangelistic campaign exhaustion.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.440]   As a result of campaigns, prayer meetings are not so well attended.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.440]   I am speaking not only of Churches, but of various other organizations which indulge
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.440]   in such activities.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.440]   "Ah," they say, "the term following the campaign, fewer people came to the prayer
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.440]   meeting than usual, fewer people came to the regular meetings.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.440]   What is the matter?"
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:53.440]   "Oh," they say, "it's the post-campaign exhaustion."
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:58.440]   Evangelistic campaigns are referenced mainly to those who are outside, but the whole essence
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.440]   of a revival is that it is something that happens to the Church, to the people inside,
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.440]   and they are affected and moved, and tremendous things happen to them.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.440]   Very well, then, what is it that happens?
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.440]   The best way, I suppose, of answering that question is to say that it is in a sense a
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.440]   repetition of the day of Pentecost.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:26.440]   It is something happening to the Church that inevitably and almost instinctively makes
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:31.440]   one look back and think again of what happened on the day of Pentecost as it is recorded
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.440]   in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.440]   What is it?
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.440]   What mean these stones?
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.440]   What happened a hundred years ago in these various countries?
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:45.440]   Let me give you some of the general characteristics.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:51.440]   The essence of a revival is that the Holy Spirit comes down upon a number of people
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:58.440]   together, upon a whole Church, upon a number of Churches, a district, or perhaps a whole
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.440]   country.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.440]   That's what is meant by revival.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.440]   It is, if you like, a visitation of the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:15.440]   Or, another term that has often been used is this, an outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:20.440]   And the terms are interesting, because, you see, what the people are conscious of is just
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.440]   that, as if something had suddenly come down upon them.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.440]   The Spirit of God has descended into their midst.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:34.440]   God has come down and is amongst them, a baptism, an outpouring, a visitation.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.440]   And what is the effect of that?
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:42.440]   Well, immediately they become aware of his presence and of his power in a manner that
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.440]   they'd never known before.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.440]   I'm talking about Christian people.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.440]   I'm talking about Church members.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:53.440]   Gathered together, as they've done so many times before, suddenly they're aware of this
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.440]   presence.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.440]   They're aware of the majesty and the awe of God.
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:06.440]   The Holy Spirit literally seems to be presiding over the meeting and taking charge of it,
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:13.440]   and manifesting his power, and guiding them, and leading them, and directing them.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.440]   That's the essence of revival.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.440]   And what does that lead to?
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:24.440]   Well, here are the general characteristics that you'll find in every revival that you
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.440]   can ever read about.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:33.440]   The immediate effect is this, that the people present begin to have an awareness of spiritual
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.440]   things such as they'd never had before.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.440]   Now I'm talking about believers, about Christian people, members of the Christian Church.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.440]   When they suddenly become conscious of this presence and this power, the first effect,
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:52.440]   I say, is that spiritual things become realities to them.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.440]   They have an awareness of them and clear views of them such as they'd never had before.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.440]   They've heard these things all before.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.440]   They may have heard them a thousand times, and indeed many thousand times, but what they
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.440]   testify is this.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.440]   They say, "You know, the whole thing suddenly became clear to me in a way I'd never seen
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   it before.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.440]   I was suddenly illuminated.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.440]   Things that I was so familiar with stood out in letters of gold, as it were.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.440]   I understood.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.440]   I saw it all in a way that I'd never done in the whole of my life."
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.440]   That's what they say.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:30.440]   The Holy Spirit, you see, enlightens the mind and the understanding.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:38.440]   They begin not only to see these things clearly but to feel their power.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.440]   What are these things that they see and of which they feel the power?
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:53.440]   First and foremost, the glory and the holiness of God.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:35:00.440]   Have you ever read your Bibles and noticed these people who suddenly realizing the presence
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:08.440]   of God, like Job put their hands upon their mouths, or like an Isaiah say, "Woe is unto
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:12.440]   me for I am a man of unclean lips."
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.440]   What's the matter with them?
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:21.440]   Oh, they've just had a realization of the holiness and the majesty and the glory of
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.440]   God.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.440]   That always happens in a revival.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.440]   It doesn't always happen in evangelistic campaigns, does it?
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.440]   There can be a lot of laughing and joking and an obvious organization in evangelistic
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.440]   campaigns, never in a revival.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:43.440]   This awe, this reverence, this holy fear, the consciousness of God in his majesty, his
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:49.440]   glory, his holiness, his utter purity.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:36:01.440]   That in turn, of course, leads inevitably to a deep and a terrible sense of sin and
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:05.440]   an awful feeling of guilt.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:12.440]   It leads men and women to feel that they're vile and unclean and utterly unworthy.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:19.440]   And above all, it leads them to realize their utter helplessness face to face with such
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.440]   a God.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.440]   Oh, like the publican depicted by our Lord in the parable, they're so conscious of all
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.440]   this that they can't lift up their faces.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.440]   They're far back near the door somewhere.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.440]   They're beating their breasts and they're saying, "God have mercy.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.440]   Be propitiated towards me, a sinner."
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:44.440]   The holiness of God, their own utter sinfulness and vileness and wretchedness, their own unworthiness.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:48.440]   They realize they've never done anything at all, they thought, before they'd done a great
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.440]   deal.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.440]   They see it's nothing.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.440]   Like Paul, they begin to talk about it as dung and filthy rags.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.440]   It's useless.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.440]   Their utter helplessness and hopelessness.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:01.440]   And they prostrate themselves and cast themselves upon the love and mercy and compassion of
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.440]   God.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   It always happens in revival.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.440]   Read the accounts for yourselves.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   I don't care which you read of.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.440]   You'll always find it.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.440]   It's invariable.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:18.440]   This is the convicting work of the spirit who takes charge of the situation.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:24.440]   And they may be held in that state and position for some time.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.440]   Sometimes they've been held in that state for not only hours, but days and weeks and
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.440]   months.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.440]   And they become almost desperate.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:39.440]   Then they're given a clear view of the love of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.440]   And especially of his death upon the cross.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.440]   At last they see it.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.440]   Oh, they'd always believed it theoretically and they'd stayed to a communion service,
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.440]   but they'd never felt anything.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.440]   It had never really become real to them.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.440]   They'd believed it, yes.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.440]   They were honestly trusting to it, but they never felt its power.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.440]   They'd never known what it was to be melted by it, to be broken by it.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.440]   They'd never known what it was to weep with a sense of unworthiness.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:12.440]   And then of love and of joy, as they realized that God so loved the world that he gave his
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:17.440]   only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:22.440]   life, suddenly it all becomes real to them.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:27.440]   And they are given to know that the Son of God has loved them and has given himself for
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.440]   them.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.440]   It becomes an individual and a personal matter.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.440]   He died for me.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.440]   Even my sins are forgiven.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.440]   And peace comes into their hearts.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.440]   Joy enters into them.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:43.440]   And they're lost in love and in a sense of praise to God the Father, God the Son, and
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.440]   God the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:50.440]   And this now becomes to them the one thing that absorbs them.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.440]   If they meet a man, they talk about it at once.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.440]   Everybody's talking about it.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.440]   It's the main topic of conversation.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.440]   It's the thing that absorbs all their interest.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.440]   They desire to be together now and to talk about these things.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.440]   And so they get together and they hold meetings.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.440]   They meet every night and they begin to talk about these things.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.440]   And then they begin to praise God and they sing hymns to his glory.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.440]   And then they begin to pray.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:16.440]   And there they are, hour after hour, night after night, longing to end work, that they
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:23.440]   may get together with people who've experienced this movement of the Spirit of God.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.440]   And that, of course, in turn, leads them to have a great concern about others who are
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.440]   outside and who don't know these things.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:35.440]   I'm giving you a synopsis of what you read in the books.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.440]   They begin to get a concern for the members of their own family.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   Husband, wife, father, mother, children, brothers, sisters.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.440]   They don't know this.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.440]   They're outside.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.440]   And they tell them about it.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.440]   They feel they must.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.440]   There's a constraint that is driving them.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.440]   Friends, everybody.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:55.440]   And so they talk about it to people and then they begin to pray for them.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.440]   Prayer is always a great feature of every revival.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.440]   Great prayer meetings, intercession, hour after hour.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:06.440]   They'll name them by name and they'll plead and they won't let God go, as it were.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:12.440]   They're intent upon this with a strange urgency.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.440]   And then, after a while, these others who are outside hearing of all this and seeing
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.440]   the change in those whom they've known so long, they begin to join the meetings and
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.440]   say, "What is this?"
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.440]   And they come in and they go through the same experience.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.440]   And thus it goes.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.440]   And thousands upon thousands are converted.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.440]   Indeed, the whole neighborhood seems to be full of the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.440]   He seems to be everywhere.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.440]   People are not only converted in meetings.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.440]   Some are converted as they're walking to the meetings before they've even got there.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:49.440]   Some are converted at their work in a coal mine on top of a mountain.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.440]   Some are awakened in the middle of the night.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.440]   They went to bed feeling as usual.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.440]   They're awakened with an awful sense of sin and they have to get out and pray and plead
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.440]   with God to have mercy.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.440]   Nobody's spoken to them at that moment.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.440]   It's the Spirit of God that's acting.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.440]   He's dominating the whole area.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.440]   He's filling the lives of all the people.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:16.440]   That is what happens in revival and thus you get this curious, strange mixture, as it were,
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:24.440]   of great conviction of sin and great joy, great sense of the terror of the Lord, great
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.440]   thanksgiving and praise.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.440]   There is what somebody once called a divine disorder always in a revival.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.440]   Some groaning and agonizing under conviction.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:41.440]   Others praising God for the great salvation.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.440]   And all this leads to crowded and prolonged meetings.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.440]   Time seems to be forgotten.
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.440]   People seem to have entered into eternity.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.440]   A meeting may start at 6.30 in the evening.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.440]   It may not end until daybreak the next morning.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.440]   And nobody was aware of the passing of the hours.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.440]   They didn't have to provide coffee once or twice halfway through.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.440]   No, no, people have forgotten the body.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:08.440]   Ah, you may laugh, my friends, but you see that is what is happening when man organizes
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.440]   these things.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.440]   Not when the Holy Ghost organizes them.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:19.440]   Time, the body and the needs of the flesh, they're all forgotten.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.440]   What is a revival?
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.440]   Well, a revival really means days of heaven upon earth.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:30.440]   Let me close this morning by just giving you one of the greatest definitions ever written
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:37.440]   of what is true of a town when there is such a revival or a visitation of the Spirit of God.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:43.440]   I'm going to read some words by the great and saintly Jonathan Edwards about the city,
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:49.440]   the little town of Northampton in Massachusetts in 1735.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:57.440]   "This work," he says, "soon made a glorious alteration in the town, so that in the spring
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:03.440]   and summer following, it seemed," that's to say, "the town seemed to be full of the presence
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.440]   of God.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:12.440]   It never was so full of love nor so full of joy and yet so full of distress as it was then.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:18.440]   There were remarkable tokens of God's presence in almost every house.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:23.440]   It was a time of joy in families on account of salvation being brought to them,
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:28.440]   parents rejoicing over their children as newborn and husbands over their wives
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.440]   and wives over their husbands.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:35.440]   The goings of God were then seen in His sanctuary.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:40.440]   God's day was a delight and His tabernacles were amiable.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.440]   Our public assemblies were then beautiful.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   The congregation was alive in God's service.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:52.440]   Everyone earnestly intent on the public worship, every hearer eager to drink in the words
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.440]   of the minister as they came from his mouth.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:01.440]   The assembly in general were, from time to time, in tears while the word was preached,
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:08.440]   some weeping with sorrow and distress, others with joy and love, others with pity
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:14.440]   and concern for the souls of their neighbors.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:20.440]   Well, there I have given you a rough outline of what happens in revival.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.440]   What mean these stones?
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:27.440]   Well, that's exactly what happened a hundred years ago in America, Ulster, Wales, Scotland,
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.440]   Sweden and parts of England and other lands.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.440]   God did that.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:39.440]   This visitation of the Spirit of God.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.440]   Do you know about these things, my friends?
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.440]   Are you interested?
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.440]   Are you concerned?
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.440]   Are you moved?
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:55.440]   Don't you begin to see that if only this happened, this is what would solve our problems?
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.440]   This is God visiting His people.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:10.440]   Days of heaven upon earth, the presidency of the Holy Spirit in the church, life abundant
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:14.440]   given to God's people without measure.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.440]   God willing, we'll continue our study of this.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:23.440]   But, oh, I trust that already we've seen and felt something that creates within us
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:27.440]   not only the desire to ask the question, "What is this?"
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:35.440]   but further, oh, that we might know it, oh, that it might happen to us
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:43.440]   and feel that to such an extent that we begin to plead with God to have pity and to have mercy
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:50.440]   and to visit us in that way with His great salvation.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.440]   Amen.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:56.440]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
