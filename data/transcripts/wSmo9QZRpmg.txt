[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.640]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.100]   This episode was hosted by the Retired Life States Chapter
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.420]   and recorded September 21st, 2021.
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.900]   It features Wade Pfau, PhD, CFA, discussing RISA,
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.580]   his retirement income style awareness tool,
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.220]   as well as tax planning considerations in retirement.
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.700]   Bogleheads are investors who follow
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.420]   John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.860]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.140]   This recording is for informational purposes only

[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.980]   as personalized investment advice.
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.860]   Welcome everybody to the Retired Life Stage meeting.
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.820]   I'm Alan, one of the chapter coordinators
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.300]   along with my colleagues, Robert, Henry, and Raj.
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.580]   We're very pleased to have Wade Pfau joining us this evening.
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.260]   We'll start with our usual disclaimer
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.340]   that this presentation is for informational purposes only
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.460]   and should not be construed
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.380]   as personalized investment advice.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.340]   And I'll turn the mic over to my colleague, Robert,
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.980]   who will formally introduce Wade
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.300]   and the presentation topics.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.580]   Thank you, Robert. - Thank you, Alan.
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.060]   Yes, well, it's my pleasure this evening
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.340]   to introduce our guests, Dr. Wade Pfau.
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.020]   I think many in the Boglehead community
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.020]   are quite aware of his accomplishments.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.440]   Wade is a retirement researcher
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.480]   and professor of retirement income in the PhD program
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.100]   for financial and retirement planning
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.500]   at the American College of Financial Services.
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.660]   He's also principal director of retirement research
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.060]   at McLean Asset Management,
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.460]   and he's the founder of Retirement Researcher.
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.780]   Wade holds a master's and doctorate in economics
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.620]   from Princeton University
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.180]   and a bachelor of arts and a bachelor of science degrees
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.900]   from the University of Iowa.
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.700]   He's also a chartered financial analyst.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.020]   Wade is a prolific writer and researcher.
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.180]   He's authored many papers and books
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.700]   on a wide spectrum of retirement-related topics,
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.300]   including in-retirement withdrawal rates,
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.160]   optimum asset allocations for retirement,
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.220]   and the role of annuities retirement portfolio.
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.420]   His latest book, of which we will speak from tonight,
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.420]   is called "The Retirement Planning Guidebook,"
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.880]   which I have, let me show you, nice and big.
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.380]   "Navigating Important Decisions for Retirement Success."
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.160]   As a retirement community here,
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.780]   most of us know that the deaccumulation phase of our assets
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.140]   can be a lot more complex than the accumulation phase,
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.900]   and I think this work helps us in that regard.
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.400]   Wade's gonna speak twice tonight,
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.140]   two different presentations.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.280]   The first presentation's gonna work
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.100]   the left side of our brain,
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.420]   and it's directed more towards
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.820]   the behavioral side of finance.
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.260]   We'll be looking at the retirement
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.700]   income styles and decisions.
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.220]   It's kind of a Morningstar-style box
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.980]   for self-awareness of income strategies.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.100]   I believe they use the acronym RESA,
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.860]   which is Retirement Income Style Awareness.
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.820]   These questionnaires in RESA, in theory,
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.780]   can reveal an individual's tolerance
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.480]   for risk in retirement,
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.420]   what income style best fits that individual,
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.060]   and the value of financial advice
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.100]   if they choose to move in that direction.
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.980]   The second presentation
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.500]   will work the other side of our brain,
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.100]   and it really deals with Chapter 10 from his textbook,
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.700]   and it's "Tax Planning
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.500]   for Efficient Retirement Distributions."
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.380]   Here, Wade will present some tax-efficient distributions
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.000]   that can prolong the sustainability of retirement assets
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.420]   and take an advantage of really of tax diversification
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.100]   and tax bracket management.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.340]   So with that, I hand it over to Dr. Wade Fowler.
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.420]   - Okay, thank you, Robert,
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.740]   and thanks, Alan and Raj and Lady Geek
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.740]   and everyone who's been helpful
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.940]   in setting up the meeting today.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.180]   Can you see my screen okay?
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.580]   I don't have the usual Zoom.
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.820]   Can everyone hear me and see?
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.780]   - Yes. - Okay, great.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.060]   So thanks, everyone.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.020]   I joined the Bogleheads, I think it was 2010.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.580]   My profile will verify that.
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.000]   I was pretty active for a few years.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.980]   I haven't been as active in recent years,
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.980]   but it is great to reconnect again
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.780]   with the Bogleheads community.
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.020]   And as Robert mentioned,
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.020]   the presentations today are from,
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.760]   based on the "Retirement Planning Guidebook,"
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.100]   which I've really been writing for nine years now,
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.820]   and it's finally finished.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.820]   The presentations aren't equal in length,
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.980]   just in terms of this topic was about 15 pages of the book,
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.100]   and then the tax planning chapter was more than 70 pages.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.460]   So we won't have that big of a difference
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.540]   in presentation lengths,
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.540]   but hopefully we'll have some more time
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.660]   for the tax planning compared to,
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.900]   we'll start with the retirement income styles.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.700]   So with that being said,
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.020]   I've now generally tried to approach retirement
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.940]   with these 12 general topic areas.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.500]   And I think what we're talking about first
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.820]   is retirement income styles is the best starting point
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.020]   to start thinking about building a retirement strategy.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.300]   And also in that regard too,
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.580]   we ran a poll about which chapters
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.260]   my retirement researcher community
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.460]   was most interested to hear about.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.580]   In tax planning, our second presentation today
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.060]   won that poll by a wide margin.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.900]   And the retirement income styles was in third place.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.820]   The second place one was the,
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.100]   how much can you spend from an investment portfolio?
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.580]   That whole 4% rule world type topic
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.900]   that I know is also quite popular at Bogleheads.
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.420]   But we'll talk about the retirement income styles,
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.420]   and then you can just see the other aspects
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.460]   of like understanding different retirement risks,
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.740]   quantifying your goals,
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.420]   determining if you're prepared for retirement,
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.660]   looking at different investment and annuity strategies,
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.420]   which will stem from understanding
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.260]   your retirement income style.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.260]   And then the social security claiming decision,
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.140]   healthcare and Medicare decisions,
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.140]   long-term care, retirement housing, the tax planning,
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.420]   legacy and incapacity planning.
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.620]   And then just as important as any of the finances
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.380]   is just the non-financial aspect
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.900]   of having purpose and passion for retirement
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.300]   and then implementing and monitoring the plan.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.460]   So would that be instead
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.500]   for the retirement income style discussion,
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.300]   the agenda will be to just discuss
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.460]   that there are a lot of different
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.020]   retirement income strategies out there.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.660]   And we haven't really in the past
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.780]   had a way to choose among them.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.060]   And I think that's just created conflict
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.940]   because there's just,
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.940]   you can ask basic questions about retirement
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.420]   and get completely different answers
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.460]   based on who you're talking to.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.620]   And so we need a way to better filter these styles.
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.100]   And that's, this led to a research project
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.180]   that I did with Alex Mardia,
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.700]   where we tried to identify just by reading
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.540]   and reading everything out there about retirement planning.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.700]   How did people talk about retirement planning?
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.420]   Were there particular factors that seem to be prevalent
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.140]   in terms of there's some sort of trade-off out there?
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.740]   And then we did try to test those with,
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.740]   we started with about 900 questions.
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.900]   Alex likes to talk about that.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.060]   We whittled it down quite a bit since then.
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.020]   But can we figure out if there are distinct preferences
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.780]   that might help to define a style?
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.740]   And what was really interesting was about that.
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.860]   And as I'll be talking about is just
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.300]   how well these different preferences work together
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.220]   to actually explain the main retirement strategies
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.020]   that we know about.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.460]   And so then linking these styles
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.740]   to the different strategies and different retirement tools.
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:33.020]   So we know that retirement is different from pre-retirement,
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.900]   that this is the whole issue
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.260]   of what makes retirement income planning distinct.
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.100]   Pre-retirement, you're still working
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.060]   and can rely on work to fund your lifestyle,
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.220]   you're saving for the future.
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.060]   But you're generally,
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.860]   you have more of an accumulation mindset
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.500]   where you can focus more on risk-adjusted returns,
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.020]   modern portfolio theory,
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.180]   like building that efficient frontier,
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.300]   seeking a well-diversified investment portfolio.
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.420]   But a few things change in retirement.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.900]   You now change from adding new savings
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.100]   to now taking distributions.
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.100]   And that you don't know how long
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:06.940]   you're gonna be doing that for.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.940]   So there's this element of longevity risk.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.220]   There's an element of when you're taking distributions
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.060]   from your portfolio,
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.740]   there are sequence of returns risk
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.580]   that a market downturn can harm you
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.460]   in a way that it doesn't pre-retirement.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.500]   Because if you have to sell from a declining portfolio,
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.300]   there's less available to recover
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.060]   from any sort of subsequent market recovery.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.500]   And then the different spending shocks
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.580]   with the healthcare, long-term care and so forth.
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.660]   And so this analogy about mountain climbing is,
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.540]   with mountain climbing,
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.780]   we might think the goal is to make it
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.900]   to the top of the mountain.
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.540]   Just like with retirement planning,
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.900]   we think the goal is to reach the retirement date
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.180]   with a certain wealth accumulation target,
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.180]   whatever that number may be.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.260]   But the reality is,
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.620]   you need to make it back down the mountain as well.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.620]   And with mountain climbing,
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.620]   most of the accidents do happen on the way down the mountain.
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.900]   With a retirement income, it's more difficult.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.380]   There's more challenges post-retirement than pre-retirement.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.940]   And so that speaks to the need
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.220]   to think about retirement a bit differently.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.580]   But it is still the Wild West
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.380]   in terms of retirement income strategies.
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.180]   And you'll see so much debate and discussion.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.740]   And that's where we wanna try
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.740]   to just provide some more general guidance
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.540]   or some framework for thinking
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.020]   about these different retirement strategies.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.300]   Now, this is from a book I wrote a few years back
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.660]   that was focused more on investment-based strategies.
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.460]   But I think there's 37 different strategies here.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.740]   And that's just a sampling of...
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.460]   And one of these, like the Bogleheads,
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.380]   I would classify as having a variable spending strategy.
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.140]   There's that variable withdrawal percentage,
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.140]   I think that's the name of it.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.860]   Lady Geek, I'm sure, is already putting in the chat.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.100]   There's a number of different strategies out there.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.340]   And well, more generally beyond that as well,
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.180]   for about 10 years,
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.580]   the Financial Planning Association has clarified
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.420]   that there's three main types of retirement strategies.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.860]   And there can be a lot of subcategories.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.580]   And that's where the previous slide
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.740]   was more about the subcategories.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.220]   But you have generally systematic withdrawal strategies
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.140]   that in this retirement income style awareness,
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.220]   we're gonna rename as just total returns,
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.620]   because it's more about taking systematic withdrawals
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.300]   from a total return investing portfolio.
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.540]   It's probably where a lot of Bogleheads
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.420]   are kind of thinking as a starting point
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.060]   for retirement income.
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.740]   There's essential versus discretionary,
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.380]   which is about building a floor
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.380]   of more lifetime-based reliable income,
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.500]   protected lifetime income,
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.460]   like emphasizing more social security.
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.580]   And then beyond that, beyond any pensions,
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.140]   there may be a role for an annuity
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.020]   to help build a protected lifetime income floor.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.740]   And then with the remaining assets,
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.380]   investing for upside and investing more
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.700]   for discretionary types of expenses.
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.940]   And then time segmentation
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.340]   was always some sort of hybrid between the two.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.540]   And that's also known as a bucketing strategy
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.420]   that's where you invest differently
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.580]   for the short-term and the long-term.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.780]   With time segmentation, you might say,
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.100]   well, if I have bonds maturing for the next five years,
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.140]   I can have at least five years worth of expenses covered.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.540]   And then all my other assets
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.540]   in my growth diversified investment portfolio
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.660]   are meant to cover the expenses in year six and beyond.
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.540]   And I have an opportunity to endure a market downturn
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.740]   and to have time for the portfolio to recover
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.340]   because I'm just spending my fixed income
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.980]   until I get through that period.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.260]   And hopefully then the market will recover
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.220]   and then I can resume drawing from the growth portfolio
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.020]   to replenish the time segmentation portfolio,
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.100]   the front end fixed income ladder.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.540]   And so again, the systematic withdrawals
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.700]   is the total return investing approach.
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.580]   It's starting point is like the 4% rule of thumb
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.900]   that's discussed quite a bit.
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.740]   I know I saw even on the main page of Bogleheads right now,
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.980]   there was a thread mentioning the 4% rule.
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.620]   That was what Bill Bingen developed in the 1990s.
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.420]   The idea of if you have a portfolio with 50 to 75% stocks
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.660]   and you're planning for a 30 year retirement horizon,
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.260]   you should be able to take 4% out of the portfolio
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.660]   in year one.
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.700]   And then that gives you a level of spending
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.100]   that you can adjust for inflation.
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.060]   And based on US historical data,
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.620]   anticipate your money will last for at least 30 years.
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.780]   Now this can also include like variable spending strategies
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.220]   where you're spending changes
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.940]   in response to portfolio performance and so forth.
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.300]   But this is very much an investment focused,
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:33.340]   diversified portfolio spending from the portfolio
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.660]   as a core retirement strategy.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.140]   And then sort of opposite from it
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.900]   is more like that essential versus discretionary,
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.540]   but we'll call that income protection
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.620]   with retirement income style awareness.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.420]   And that's more the sense of thinking
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.020]   about simple income annuities,
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.980]   building a lifetime protected income floor
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.460]   to cover your essential expenses.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.780]   So you're protected from longevity risk.
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.220]   Even if you live to 100,
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.980]   you still have the money coming in through the contract.
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.420]   You're protected from the market risk for that,
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.820]   but then you can use the investment portfolio on top
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.940]   to then cover more diversified
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.700]   or more discretionary types of spending.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.660]   And these are gonna be,
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.260]   as we get into the retirement income style awareness,
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.620]   these will be the two core strategies.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.100]   And the other two strategies I'll talk about
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.540]   really have more of a behavioral element to them.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.980]   So time segmentation, again,
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.980]   it's that I invest with bonds for the short-term expenses
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.260]   and then with stocks or other more growth-focused assets
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.340]   for longer-term expenses.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.740]   And that's some sort of hybrid,
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.540]   trying to rely on the market,
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.780]   but also getting some sort
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.060]   of short-term contractual protection,
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.540]   just not over the lifetime,
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.780]   but over a shorter time period.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.660]   And then a fourth strategy we'll consider
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.260]   is the risk-wrap strategy,
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.820]   which is a cousin of that income protection strategy.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.820]   The simple income annuities
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.940]   are not very popular in practice.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.260]   And in practice,
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.580]   deferred annuities with living benefits
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.900]   are used much more frequently,
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.540]   whether it's the variable annuities
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.700]   or the fixed index annuities,
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.460]   or now we even have the registered index-linked annuities.
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.820]   These are annuities that still provide
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.060]   some sort of underlying liquidity,
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.220]   still provide some upside potential,
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.740]   but can also support a lifetime income.
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.500]   And so it really is gonna work out
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.860]   to be a distinct strategy from income protection.
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.540]   So these are the four basic retirement strategies
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.500]   that most anything can then kind of
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.460]   be somewhat close to one of these four.
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.220]   And like the Boglehead's
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.900]   variable percentage withdrawal strategy,
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.380]   I would put in the family of total return strategies.
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.620]   Now, the next question is,
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.300]   how do retirees choose from these possibilities?
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.300]   And so they might be listening to a radio show
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.980]   or hearing commercials on the radio
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.940]   about different financial advisors
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.220]   pitching different strategies.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.780]   They may just be personal finance blogs.
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.860]   Of course, discussions at the Boglehead's
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:03.060]   is gonna be a great resource for everyone on the call today.
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.620]   They may just be reading the consumer finance,
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.460]   personal finance type consumer media,
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.780]   attending different seminars or other events, webinars,
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.100]   a local class, a lot of local organizations,
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.900]   adult education programs will provide
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.540]   retirement planning classes
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.460]   or working with a financial advisor.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.620]   But still, we don't really have the tools
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.860]   to identify who should use what type of strategy.
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.740]   Like, that's the question.
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.100]   If I'm starting to think about retirement,
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.860]   should I use an income protection strategy?
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.100]   Should I use a total return strategy?
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.420]   We haven't really had the tools for that.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.540]   And a lot of financial service professionals
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.580]   tend to like put their stake into one camp.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.700]   And so if I'm an investment manager,
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.020]   I would tend to recommend a total return strategy
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.020]   to everyone.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.980]   Or if I'm an insurance agent,
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.260]   I would tend to recommend
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.980]   some sort of annuity-based strategy to everyone.
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.620]   And it's like, if the only tool you have is a hammer,
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.300]   then everything looks like a nail, even when it's not.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.780]   And so we haven't had a way
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.100]   to really better filter these strategies.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.260]   Now, this starts to get into like,
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.060]   with the retirement's different
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.100]   as we started the presentation.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.220]   So people might have different concerns
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.140]   about different types of retirement risks.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.180]   And you can think about like,
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.700]   what are you the most worried about?
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.020]   Is it the idea that you might outlive your assets?
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.340]   Are you really worried about that sequence of returns risk,
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.980]   which is like, you know, Robert's,
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.540]   or not Robert's law, but Murphy's law,
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.740]   the one where like, if I retire today,
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.140]   tomorrow's gonna be the day that the stock market drops.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.420]   Is that something that you're really worried about?
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.740]   The different spending shocks,
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.220]   like, are you very worried about
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.780]   what if I have a significant long-term care event?
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.220]   The impacts of declining cognitive abilities,
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.900]   the impacts of compounding inflation and so forth.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.940]   And that speaks to, these are the four L's.
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.180]   These are the financial goals of retirement
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.060]   and they're impacted by different risks.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.100]   And so you may then have different concerns
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.860]   about these goals.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.820]   So longevity is about your essential spending.
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.580]   And it's the idea that no matter how long you live,
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.460]   you wanna at least ensure you have your basics covered.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.660]   Is that something that resonates with you?
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.580]   Is something you're worried about?
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.740]   Or are you maybe just focused more on the lifestyle,
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.660]   which is your overall lifestyle goal,
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.940]   including discretionary spending?
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.260]   Are you someone who might view your retirement as a failure
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.700]   if you're not able to meet all your lifestyle expenses?
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.140]   And I'm guessing with bogleheads,
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.980]   there's probably more of an emphasis
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.540]   on kind of the longevity
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.940]   because bogleheads tend to not just spend excessively
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:35.860]   and so forth.
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.460]   But lifestyle does imply some sort of,
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.660]   like if you're a member of a country club,
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.060]   a lot of people would classify that
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.260]   as a discretionary expense.
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.620]   But some people might be really worried
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.100]   if they can't meet that expense,
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.180]   they may feel like their retirement is a failure.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.940]   So do you have a greater concern for lifestyle expenses?
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.460]   Legacy goals.
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.220]   Now, what we find in practice is legacy goals
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.580]   are often not a primary concern for most people.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.460]   A lot of people do take the view that,
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.020]   well, the errors can have whatever's left over at the end.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.060]   Of course, some people do like to earmarks
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.460]   a specific legacy goal.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.660]   I would like to leave X number of dollars to so-and-so.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.940]   And so if that's a bigger concern,
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.260]   it's usually not gonna rank as a top concern
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.820]   for most retirees, but it might for you.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.260]   It's just, how do you think about legacy
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.940]   as a particular concern in terms of a goal
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.620]   you want to be able to ensure you can meet?
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:33.620]   And then liquidity is about having additional liquid assets
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.180]   available to cover unexpected spending shocks.
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.180]   And there's different ways to think about liquidity.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.140]   We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.420]   But is liquidity something that worries you?
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.820]   And if you're very worried,
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.780]   like you're concerned about spending today
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.020]   because you're concerned about a long-term care event
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.180]   that could happen, that would imply
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.740]   more of a liquidity concern as being something that you're...
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.420]   Liquidity is more about than just an emergency fund.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.100]   It's significant spending shocks
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.300]   and needing to make sure
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.900]   that you can handle unexpected expenses
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.780]   outside of what you budgeted for.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.460]   So then how do we match up your style
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.780]   based on your concerns,
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.420]   the risks that you're concerned about
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.060]   and just going through that thought process?
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.500]   Well, that's where this research that Alex and I did.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.900]   And just it's a project that was going on last year
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.020]   and finished it this year.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.220]   And this is the actual research article for it.
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.260]   If anyone's interested to read the full length version,
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.460]   it is pretty long,
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.260]   but I'll give a more basic explanation of it today.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.540]   And then what we found is, like I said,
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.420]   we were just looking at all kinds of different writings
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.780]   about retirement planning, trying to identify factors.
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.780]   And then what we did was an exploratory factor analysis
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.540]   to just let the data tell us from the questionnaires,
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.740]   which factors or which questions seem to correspond
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.060]   into some sort of particular factor
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.940]   that can explain a set of preferences.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.860]   And then what we found, and I'll talk about what these are,
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.460]   but the two primary factors
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.020]   that came out of this exploratory factor analysis
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.060]   is a statistical method.
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.100]   It's this, what we call probability-based
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.340]   versus safety first,
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.980]   and then optionality versus commitment.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.060]   And then we found four factors that were significant.
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.340]   They weren't shown to be as distinct or as important,
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.180]   but ultimately they can help tell the story.
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.020]   And that's these,
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.620]   well, I'll go through each of these in detail,
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.340]   so no need to list them by name right now,
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.180]   but we'll talk about these.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:36.460]   And then what comes out of that,
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.700]   and I'll explain that as well,
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.940]   is when we understand how somebody scores
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.660]   on these different factors,
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.180]   that really can help to describe
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.220]   what type of retirement strategy will resonate with them,
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.260]   whether it's a total return or a risk graph
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.820]   or income protection or a time segmentation.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.580]   And so this is based on the retirement income optimization
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.340]   framework, which is those four L's
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.580]   as the financial goals on the left,
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.420]   mapping into liabilities or expenses on the right,
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.420]   and then thinking about how we position assets
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.940]   to meet our goals.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.940]   And the different styles
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.580]   are gonna put different emphasis there,
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.940]   where if you're total return,
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.300]   you don't care as much about reliable income
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.580]   as a specific asset.
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.700]   You're fine using the diversified portfolio
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.020]   to cover essential expenses.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.660]   And also if you're total return,
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.140]   you're gonna put less emphasis on having reserves
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.300]   as a distinct category.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.580]   You're more comfortable with just general liquidity,
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.340]   not necessarily thinking about how assets are earmarked
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.180]   for different purposes and so forth.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:41.380]   So this slide is just in an article
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.140]   that came out today in Advisor Perspectives.
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.780]   So risk tolerance questionnaires,
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.740]   that's the fundamental tool a lot of people use
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.540]   to decide on an asset allocation.
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.460]   It's like how much short-term market volatility
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.060]   can you stomach to explain,
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.940]   should I have a 40% stock allocation
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.900]   or a 90% stock allocation?
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.940]   There's a lot of concerns
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.420]   about risk tolerance questionnaires in general
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.460]   about how well they work.
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.020]   And really the point here
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.140]   is not to get into any of that discussion,
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.620]   but to just point out,
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.500]   risk tolerance questionnaires don't really line up
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.940]   with retirement concerns very well.
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:15.980]   And as can be expected,
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.900]   they actually, they do line up with the lifestyle concern,
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.260]   which is kind of how you might think about it.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.460]   Like if I'm more risk tolerant,
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.740]   if I can stomach more market volatility,
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.140]   it might, especially when we get through
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:27.980]   this whole discussion,
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.180]   it might imply I'm comfortable,
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.260]   or I have more concern about my overall lifestyle,
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.180]   and I'm not necessarily thinking as much
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.820]   about the other concerns.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.220]   But with the two main factors
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.980]   that we'll look at with retirement income style awareness,
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.620]   we can find a match
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.700]   to all of the different retirement concerns
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.660]   where reserves would be liquidity in this context.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.980]   Okay, so these two main factors now,
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:52.900]   this is where we're starting
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.660]   to get into the meat of the matter.
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.660]   So how would you like to draw your retirement income?
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.820]   If you're someone who's probability-based,
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.940]   you're more comfortable relying on market growth.
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.700]   We have the idea of the risk premium
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.180]   that stocks will outperform bonds
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.500]   over reasonable holding periods.
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.060]   And if you're comfortable relying on the risk premium,
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.260]   and historically the S&P 500s
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.500]   outperformed long-term government bonds
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.540]   by 6% on average since the 1920s,
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.820]   if you're comfortable using that to fund your retirement,
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.060]   you're more probability-based.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.100]   Safety first is you really would prefer
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.220]   to have some sort of contractual protection
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.180]   supporting your income.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.580]   That could be holding individual bonds to maturity,
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.100]   or it could also be using risk pooling through an annuity,
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.140]   but you're less comfortable
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.140]   relying on the market in this regard.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.380]   You'd rather have some sort of contractual protection
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.340]   backing up your retirement plan.
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.740]   And you can think about how you might answer
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.340]   or how you might identify yourself on that spectrum.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.300]   And then optionality, this kind of surprised me
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.140]   because if I had to guess in advance
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.980]   which would be the two most important factors,
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.620]   I don't think I would have picked this one.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.340]   I probably would have picked something more
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.380]   like accumulation versus distribution,
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.180]   but this is just how much optionality
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.580]   do you want in your plan?
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:16.420]   And if you're someone
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.420]   who has more of an optionality preference,
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.820]   you really emphasize having flexibility,
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.060]   wanting to keep your options open.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.500]   And that's because of a sense
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.740]   of you wanna be able to take advantage of new opportunities.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.180]   You don't wanna really be locked
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.980]   into any particular strategy.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:36.020]   You really value the optionality for a plan.
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:39.820]   And commitment orientation is you feel more comfortable
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.460]   just locking into a solution.
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.420]   If you know that something will solve
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.660]   for a lifetime income need,
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.420]   you don't necessarily need the optionality as much.
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.420]   Of course, you're gonna want to have some liquid assets,
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.140]   but you have the sense partly as well
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.100]   that you've got a plan that will work.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.860]   So you can take it off your to-do list.
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:00.700]   You don't have to worry
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.820]   about ongoing decision-making and everything.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.940]   You're more comfortable committing to a strategy.
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.260]   And this, as I said,
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.940]   is gonna be one of the two important factors
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.660]   based on that exploratory factor analysis.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.860]   And then, well, we can see how these fit together.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.460]   So we create this matrix.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.700]   And that's how Robert said,
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.300]   like a Morningstar style box type situation.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.100]   On the left is safety first.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.940]   On the right is probability-based.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.900]   On the top is optionality,
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.020]   and on the bottom is commitment.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.820]   And so you can see these four quadrants developing
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.060]   where if you're in the upper right,
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.580]   you're probability-based, comfortable with market growth,
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.500]   and wanna keep your options open.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.140]   If you're in the lower left, you're safety first.
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.700]   You want contractual protections,
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.380]   and you're comfortable committing to a strategy.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.540]   And then it's a mixture in the other two.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:55.900]   So then the secondary factors that can help tell the story,
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.180]   but are not primary.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.100]   They're less important in terms of,
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.460]   they're not as distinct as important factors
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.980]   to help describe a strategy.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.380]   But one is like, how do you view flooring?
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.380]   Time-based or perpetual?
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.300]   And this time-based is like time-segmented flooring.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.180]   I'm thinking about, I wanna build a protected floor
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.980]   to cover my basic expenses.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.700]   If a time-based preference would mean,
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.820]   it's like time segmentation.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.740]   If I can have my basic expenses covered
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.980]   over the next three to five to eight years,
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.140]   there's some flexibility there.
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:29.180]   But if I can have the front-end expenses covered,
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.020]   I could have a time-based preference
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.580]   versus perpetual flooring.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.900]   Well, that's more like the world of like an annuity
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.460]   with risk pooling and supporting a lifetime income need.
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:43.460]   So do you have a time-based or a perpetual flooring desire?
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:47.300]   How do you view your reserve assets?
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.460]   And this is where I mentioned
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.700]   there's these two attitudes about liquidity.
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.700]   If you have a true liquidity mindset,
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.380]   you really wanna have assets
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.660]   that are not earmarked for other goals,
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.620]   that are truly liquid in the sense
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.740]   that they're your reserves.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.220]   You've already got other assets
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.820]   that are covering your future budgeted expenses,
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.740]   covering your legacy goals.
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.220]   These are assets specifically set aside as reserves
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.500]   to provide the liquidity
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.860]   to cover unexpected contingencies or spending shocks.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.660]   And you make that distinction as important.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.980]   I wanna be able to have these assets earmarked
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.580]   separately as reserves.
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.460]   Whereas those who have more of a technical liquidity mindset
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.300]   aren't making that type of distinction.
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.380]   They're thinking about their assets more generally
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.780]   as they have a total pot of assets
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.380]   and they don't necessarily have to have distinct reserves.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.780]   They'll just figure things out
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.540]   whether if they have an unexpected expense,
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.580]   they'll figure out later how that's gonna impact
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.060]   other spending and so forth.
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.660]   Technical liquidity is like a brokerage account.
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:52.500]   It's liquid, but it may be earmarked for other purposes,
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.460]   but you're really not thinking about things that way.
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:58.300]   You're just generally thinking about a big pot of assets.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:03.580]   Now, what's your mindset about retirement investing?
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.460]   If you have an accumulation mindset,
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.980]   you're really just maintaining
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.420]   the pre-retirement accumulation style of investing
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.660]   post-retirement, which is to focus
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.900]   on risk-adjusted returns for your portfolio.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.340]   And that's where your emphasis is
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.620]   over trying to maintain a predictable income
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.180]   from the portfolio.
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.860]   And I mean, any of these preferences are completely valid.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.300]   There's no problem with that,
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.740]   but you're not worried as much about predictable income.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.540]   You'd rather focus more on just maximizing portfolios
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.020]   returns subject to your risk tolerance.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.100]   Whereas if you had a distribution mindset,
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.900]   you do focus more on predictable income.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.180]   And in that regard, you don't necessarily need
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.940]   to maximize your portfolio returns anymore.
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.020]   You'd rather have stable, predictable income
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.380]   being generated by your portfolio.
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.460]   And so you'd prefer strategies that do that,
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.380]   even if they sacrifice having the highest possible
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.540]   total return from the portfolio.
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.820]   And then the final one of these
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.420]   is front-loading versus back-loading.
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.060]   If you have a front-loaded preference,
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.940]   you wanna spend more today while you're healthy and alive
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.380]   and assured that you can actually enjoy it.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.220]   And you worry less about like,
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.660]   if you have to cut your spending in the future, that's okay.
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.860]   And with a front-loaded preference.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.220]   And if you have a back-loaded preference,
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.580]   this is the idea of longevity risk aversion,
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.220]   that you're worried about outliving your money.
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.980]   So you're willing to sacrifice some spending today
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.100]   to better protect your future lifestyle.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.300]   You're wanting to more back-load your spending.
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.420]   You don't wanna be 95 years old
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.900]   and not have anything left except a social security benefit.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.900]   So you're willing to spend less today
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.020]   to stretch that money out into the future.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.660]   And now we can add those characteristics
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:48.980]   to this recent matrix as well.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.780]   And it's all based on correlations.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.900]   So probability-based does tend to be correlated
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.780]   with optionality.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.580]   That if you're comfortable with market growth,
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.260]   you also tend to want more optionality.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.380]   That's what that diagonal arrow's about,
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.100]   going from the upper right to lower left.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.140]   And then at the same time,
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.900]   safety first tends to be correlated with commitment.
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.180]   Like if you want contractual protections,
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.460]   you also tend to be more comfortable
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.260]   committing to a strategy.
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:19.100]   And then if you're safety first and optionality,
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.260]   those tend to not be as correlated with each other.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.140]   And that's where the sense
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.780]   of a behavioral strategy develops.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.980]   You want contractual protections, but you want optionality.
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.940]   It's kind of a bit of a contradiction there,
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.460]   but there's a strategy that has been created
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:38.460]   over the, since around the 1980s that can accommodate that.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.580]   Likewise, in the bottom right-hand corner,
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.660]   probability-based and commitment,
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.380]   you're comfortable relying on market growth,
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.460]   but you'd also want to commit to a strategy.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.380]   And there's also a bit of a,
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.620]   those two don't necessarily go together.
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.940]   And then we can start adding
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.020]   in where these other characteristics apply.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.540]   So in the upper right-hand corner,
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.740]   that's more of an accumulation mindset,
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.620]   tends to be up there as well.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.340]   The top half of the chart is more front-loading
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.940]   as a preference.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.860]   The, well, on the left-hand side,
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.220]   you have the true liquidity.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.540]   In the bottom left corner,
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.780]   you've got more of a distribution,
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.860]   predictable income, perpetual income floor.
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.860]   On the whole bottom half,
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.100]   you can have more of a back-loading preference.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:18.940]   And then on the right,
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.620]   you also do have a technical liquidity at work there.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.820]   So this really gives us our retirement strategies.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.860]   Think about a total return investing strategy.
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.300]   You're comfortable relying on market growth.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.580]   You want to keep your options open.
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.940]   You're more comfortable with like the tools
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.260]   of modern portfolio theory,
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.220]   more of an accumulation, risk-adjusted return.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.940]   You do think more in terms of technical liquidity.
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.740]   You have more of a front-loaded preference
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.220]   and the time-base.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.940]   You don't really have a need for perpetual income floor.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.700]   So that's the 4% rule.
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.660]   I mean, that's systematic withdrawals
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.820]   from an investment strategy.
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.060]   And those characteristics can explain that quite well.
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.220]   Then in the bottom left,
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.180]   where the other kind of consistent preferences are,
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.020]   your safety first.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.140]   So you want contractual protections.
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.380]   You're willing to commit to a lifetime strategy,
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.420]   well, commit to a strategy.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.140]   You have a distribution mindset.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.900]   So you want predictable income.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.740]   You're comfortable with a perpetual income floor.
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.500]   You want more true liquidity,
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.180]   which is earmarking assets for specific goals
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.700]   and then seeing what's left as reserves.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.140]   And you have more of a back-loaded preference.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.140]   So that's kind of describing simple income annuities
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.220]   for building a lifetime income floor.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.260]   And then a diversified investment portfolio
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.100]   can go on top of that.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.780]   Then in the upper left, that's time segmentation.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.380]   You want contractual protections,
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.380]   but you also want optionality.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.340]   And so the framework developed
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.900]   to provide both of those concerns is,
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.220]   you have contractual protections
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:48.500]   with holding fixed income assets for short-term expenses,
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.220]   but then most of your assets are left
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.140]   in a growth-based investment portfolio,
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.260]   providing the optionality.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.380]   And then the risk wrap in the lower right-hand corner,
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.380]   that's also a behavioral type strategy
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.140]   that's just been developed since the 1990s.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.140]   And again, that's that whole world of deferred annuities,
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.340]   like variable annuities
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.140]   with lifetime income benefits attached to them.
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.580]   You're comfortable relying on market growth,
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.100]   but you're not completely comfortable in some way.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.180]   You want to commit to a strategy.
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.300]   You have more of a back-loaded preference.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.220]   You have that technical liquidity mindset,
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.300]   which is the whole, the deferred annuities
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.460]   talk about how they're liquid,
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.060]   but that's been earmarked for your future spending,
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.540]   so you can't really take advantage of that liquidity.
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.980]   But that all explains building a lifetime income floor
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.340]   with deferred annuities with living benefits,
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:38.300]   and then applying the investment strategy on top of that.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:43.620]   And then based on the retirement researcher on my website,
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.820]   the kind of people who are part of that community,
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.940]   the study we did with them,
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.500]   we did find about a third of them
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.380]   were in that total return quadrant,
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.180]   somewhere around a third are in the income protection,
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.860]   and then somewhere around 15%
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.580]   were either time segmentation or risk-wrap.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.740]   And then these are styles,
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.780]   so that once you understand your retirement income style,
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.820]   it doesn't mean that you have to stick to that strategy,
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.420]   but I think it can be a useful starting point
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.380]   to think about how you want to go to approach
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.460]   building a retirement income strategy.
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.700]   And I've really explained at this point,
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:20.100]   but again, it's just going through the four strategies,
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.020]   the total return and the characteristics it has,
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.540]   the income protection and the characteristics it has,
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:30.380]   the time segmentation and the characteristics it has,
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.020]   and then the risk-wrap strategy
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.700]   and the characteristics it has.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.660]   And so to conclude about this,
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.500]   there are a number of different viable
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.580]   retirement income strategies,
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.900]   and this is a really important starting point
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.540]   that I do try to be agnostic
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:47.460]   and to say that any of these strategies
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.820]   are valid and viable.
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.580]   It's just a matter of understanding who they're right for.
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.140]   And the right approach for someone
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:56.660]   depends on their personal style.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.580]   And just because one strategy is right for you,
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.420]   a different strategy might be right for someone else.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.580]   And there's more like flexibility out there
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.460]   for people to find the kind of strategy
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.260]   that will best resonate with their personal preferences
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.180]   and personal style.
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:12.020]   I mean, it's just like when you pick a career,
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.540]   there's not one kind of job that's superior for everyone.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.340]   Some people might like more of a salesman type role
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.260]   where they have to like maybe more volatility
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.540]   to their income and that sort of thing,
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.460]   more like a total return approach.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.260]   A college professor tends to be more
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.860]   of like an income protection style
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.220]   with the bond of a tenured position
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.100]   providing income on an ongoing basis.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.420]   So there's no right or wrong answer
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.300]   to what job someone chooses.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.740]   And really there's no right or wrong answer
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:42.140]   to which style someone chooses for their retirement.
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.900]   And so this RISA, retirement income style awareness
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.460]   can provide a starting point for that discussion.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.900]   So then that was chapter one of the book
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.820]   and we don't really need this slide.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.820]   We had it at the beginning too,
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.180]   but chapter one covered that.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.860]   And then let me get through that.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.540]   And the book is at any retailers can be guessed.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.500]   And let me go ahead and stop there.
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.340]   And at one...
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.980]   Get the slides pulled up here.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.780]   - Yeah, so if you can share screen.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:15.780]   - Zoom's going slow.
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:19.180]   Here we go.
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:23.980]   Okay, can you see the slides okay?
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.460]   - Not yet.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.300]   - No.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.500]   Is it now?
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.340]   - Yes.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.300]   - Okay, I think there's just a lag.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.940]   Okay, thanks everyone.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.460]   So now we'll get into the discussion around tax planning
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.820]   for efficient retirement distributions.
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.500]   And as some of you noted, at least a few of you,
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.940]   it sounds like I did this presentation today
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.020]   at Retirement Researcher.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.420]   And it's a really hot topic right now.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.140]   And I don't have too much in the way of tax reform in this,
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:53.980]   but with...
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.380]   And we don't know what the ultimate new tax legislation
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.220]   will look like.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.660]   But with what we've heard in the last couple of weeks,
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.820]   it's not necessarily changing too much of this discussion.
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.820]   Some of the tax brackets are moving around.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.820]   The big thing might be,
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.700]   we're not gonna have the backdoor Roth anymore
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.420]   and we'll have to see how that plays out.
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.700]   But otherwise, the ongoing tax reform debate's
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.460]   not really impacting too much
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.060]   of what's in this presentation.
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:22.900]   Okay, so in that 12-step process
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:23.740]   for thinking about retirement,
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.900]   we're talking about tax planning now.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:29.420]   And so we'll talk about the logic of tax efficiency,
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:33.100]   tax diversification, asset location,
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.860]   tax efficient retirement distributions,
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.380]   pitfalls to monitor when generating taxable income,
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.820]   and then an example for tax bracket management.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.660]   And that was one,
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.260]   I did put an excerpt of that book
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.340]   into a column at Advisor Perspectives
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.140]   that was picked up at the Bogleheads.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:51.420]   So if you saw that thread,
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.540]   that's one of the places where this session was announced.
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.740]   I'll talk more about that example,
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.900]   like some more commentary on it.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:03.220]   So the logic of tax efficiency,
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.780]   and this is the punchline coming out of that example
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.860]   at the end, where with retirement planning,
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.300]   there's so many different aspects of it
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.180]   where making short-term sacrifice
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.620]   can help support a long-term benefit.
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.020]   And that's what we'll see in that example at the end,
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.100]   where the gray-colored strategy
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.540]   is watching the wealth spend down.
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.860]   For someone who claims social,
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.020]   they're a 60-year-old,
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.980]   they have $2 million at age 60, they're retired.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.380]   If they take Social Security at 62,
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.620]   and then do a conventional spend-down strategy,
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.500]   taxable, tax-deferred, tax-free,
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.340]   you can see they've got more money there for a while,
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.300]   until about age 77, and then it keeps plummeting.
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.420]   And then they run out of money around age 88.
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.460]   And the strategy that I'll identify
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.900]   as a more tax-efficient strategy
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:54.100]   is gonna do really get into
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.980]   the whole strategic Roth conversion.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:59.580]   They're gonna manage a very high level of taxable income
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.700]   until they turn 70,
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.260]   and then they're gonna start their Social Security benefit,
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.060]   and then subsequently be able to manage
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.380]   a much lower taxable income level,
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.420]   much lower adjusted gross income.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.580]   And so in the short run, they're gonna fall behind,
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.660]   especially because they're delaying Social Security,
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.660]   and they're paying more taxes early on.
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.820]   But that's gonna set them up for long-term benefit.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.820]   And ultimately with that strategy,
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:25.380]   their money is gonna last 5.6 years longer.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.700]   Okay, and they're at age 88,
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.660]   they still have about 200, I'm sorry, $320,000 left
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.380]   compared to that other strategy
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.020]   that's run out at that point.
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.020]   So in the short run,
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.180]   there's gonna be a smaller legacy value for their assets,
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.660]   but in the long run,
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.620]   the strategy is gonna pay off and help them.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.460]   And this is the example I'll be showing
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.020]   at the end of the presentation.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:50.380]   So short run costs for long-term efficiency,
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.260]   and this is an important topic
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.020]   because it really can extend the portfolio longevity
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.140]   for a retiree.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.540]   And why is that?
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.340]   Like, why is what we're talking about important?
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.100]   Because we have a progressive tax system
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.540]   in the United States where as your income goes up,
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.340]   you're paying taxes at higher tax rates.
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.180]   And so this is all about trying to,
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:13.340]   like we have to pay taxes,
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.660]   but trying to pay taxes
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.140]   when we can pay them at lower tax rates,
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.180]   and then try as much as we can within the law,
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.060]   this is all within the law,
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.100]   avoid paying taxes when we're in higher tax rates
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.940]   by strategically preparing for that.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.780]   And also the tax code is filled
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.980]   with all kinds of nonlinearities and traps
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.780]   in terms of, I'll get into how,
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:36.300]   you may think you're in the 22% tax bracket in retirement
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.460]   when you might actually be paying
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.980]   more than a 50% marginal tax rate in some circumstances.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.460]   A marginal tax rates, that's like I just said,
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.500]   can be higher than income tax rates.
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.980]   And we have a number of different types of tax treatment
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.500]   in the tax code to coordinate.
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:56.100]   So nonlinearities in the tax code,
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.300]   many tax rules are connected to adjusted gross income,
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.540]   not taxable income.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.380]   And the difference there
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.620]   is the below the line tax deductions.
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.820]   So having a big tax deduction can't save you
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.260]   from some of these nonlinearities
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.740]   because it's the adjusted gross income
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.460]   before the deduction that counts.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.500]   Itemized deductions then only count
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.900]   when they're higher than the standard deduction.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.380]   Preferential income sources,
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.620]   long-term capital gains and qualified dividends
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.060]   stack on top of other income
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.740]   and have different tax rates.
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.260]   And there can be implications of that.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:31.260]   A dollar of income can trigger tax
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.180]   on up to 85 cents of a social security dollar,
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.980]   as well as triggering tax on that dollar of income.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.340]   It can also, a dollar of income
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.260]   can trigger higher Medicare premiums.
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.500]   And I won't get into detail about that,
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:48.940]   but we also have that 3.8% net investment income tax
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.940]   is very nonlinear and how you have to calculate it
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.540]   as the minimum of two different numbers.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.260]   And required minimum distributions
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.380]   will start to play a role after age 72.
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.700]   And that can surprise someone
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.820]   by pushing them into a higher tax bracket.
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.740]   So what we're talking about here with income taxes,
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.700]   the basic kind of, when you're going through the 1040,
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.460]   total income is all your taxable income sources.
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.700]   You take off the above the line deductions,
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.460]   retirement account contributions,
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.820]   HSA contributions, that sort of thing.
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.900]   Gives you the adjusted gross income.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.860]   And then you can either take the standard deduction
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:25.380]   or itemize, and that will give you then taxable income.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:29.980]   Okay, so this is where I probably with this group tonight,
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.340]   we can accelerate this conversation.
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.740]   Everyone most likely is aware
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.180]   of the taxable brokerage accounts,
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:40.540]   tax deferred accounts, such as IRAs and 401ks
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.980]   and other employer-based retirement plans.
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.380]   And then after tax accounts,
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.140]   which are sometimes called tax exempt,
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.700]   sometimes called tax-free and sometimes called Roth.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.580]   And these are the three main types of tax structures
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.740]   we have in terms of the tax code
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.020]   providing different tax treatment.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.860]   So the taxable accounts,
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.500]   you pay ongoing taxes on income shot off from the account,
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.300]   as well as any realized capital gains.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.780]   Long-term capital gains,
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.980]   qualified dividends qualify for lower tax rates.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.660]   The cost basis or principle into the account
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.860]   can be taken out without tax.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.500]   You do get a step up in cost basis at death,
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.020]   avoiding capital gains tax.
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.380]   And that was something people were worried
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.260]   was gonna disappear with the tax reform.
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.020]   But as of now, it looks like it will remain.
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.260]   And then also distributions from taxable accounts
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:30.860]   can be structured to get capital gains or capital losses.
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.820]   You can trigger capital gains
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.580]   or you can trigger capital losses.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:35.780]   And if you trigger a capital loss,
[00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.700]   there's the wash sale rule.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:40.100]   You have to wait 30 days to buy back the same asset,
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.820]   but you can trigger capital gains by selling the asset
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.740]   and immediately buying it back
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.460]   and triggering that taxable income
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.700]   if you're doing that for a strategic reason.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.580]   Tax-deferred accounts.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.500]   We think of them as generally being deductible,
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.780]   contributions, and then tax-deferred
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.340]   until distributions are taken.
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.740]   And those are taxes, ordinary income,
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.820]   required minimum distribution start at age 72.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.180]   You may have an employer match
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.820]   and also early withdrawal penalties
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.220]   can be an issue before age 59 and a half.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:13.460]   Tax-exempt or Roth accounts,
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:17.900]   Roth IRAs, employee contributions to Roth 401ks.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.380]   You had to pay taxes on that money.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.980]   It's not tax deductible.
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.940]   But once it goes into the account,
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.540]   assuming you have a qualified distribution,
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.980]   which you can set up to have fairly easily,
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:31.300]   assuming you're at least 59 and a half
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.900]   and had the Roth IRA open for at least,
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.900]   had a Roth IRA open for at least five years,
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.380]   then you do not have to pay taxes on the distribution.
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:43.820]   Roth IRAs do not have required minimum distributions.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:47.060]   Roth 401ks do, but you can just roll over to a Roth IRA
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.980]   to avoid that problem.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.420]   There are income restrictions
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.180]   on making contributions to Roth IRAs.
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:56.260]   And like I said, right now we have the backdoor Roth idea
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.500]   where you make a non-deductible contribution to an IRA
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.580]   and then convert that to a Roth.
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:05.660]   That currently with the proposed legislation
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.460]   will not be allowed starting in 2022.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.260]   But that, of course, any of that can change.
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.260]   So we're nowhere near the final tax law.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.620]   And this can be a good choice in low income years
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:17.420]   to contribute to the Roth account
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.340]   when you're in a lower tax rate relative to the future.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.860]   So when you're choosing between the two,
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.180]   this is all kind of basic financial literacy type stuff
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:30.300]   as well, that you're trying to pay taxes at lower rates.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.700]   So when you have a high income or you're paying,
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.220]   you're in high marginal tax brackets,
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.860]   that's a good idea to make the contribution
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.900]   to a tax deferred account and get the tax deduction.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.020]   If you're in between jobs or something
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.260]   where you're currently have a lower income
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:46.940]   facing lower tax rates,
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.420]   that can be a good opportunity to put into a Roth account.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:53.380]   And the same logic applies to Roth conversions.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.020]   You wanna do it when the current tax rates are lower
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.340]   relative to what you believe they'll be in the future
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:45:59.860]   for your situation.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.260]   And it's also nice to have some tax diversification
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.780]   between each of the different types of tax structures.
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:09.020]   Now, if you'd like, because there's limits
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:13.220]   on how much can go into the Roth and employer plans
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:16.940]   and IRAs, if you'd like additional tax benefits beyond that,
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:20.420]   there are different options, 529 plans,
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.460]   health savings accounts
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.060]   with the high deductible health insurance
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.660]   where you get that triple benefit of tax deductions,
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.300]   tax deferral, and tax redistributions
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:30.700]   for qualified medical expenses.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.460]   I-bonds or E-bonds give you that they're taxable,
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:34.860]   but you get tax deferral.
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.260]   You're not paying taxes until the distribution
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.980]   or until you have redeemed them.
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:44.020]   Tax-exempt bonds can give you tax deferral
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.220]   and tax redistributions,
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:48.580]   though they have a warning when it comes to retirement.
[00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:50.180]   Interest from those can be counted
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.620]   towards determining Social Security and Medicare taxes.
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:57.420]   Non-qualified annuities and then life insurance
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.580]   can all provide tax benefits as well.
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.860]   Asset location.
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.860]   So we have these different tax structures.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.260]   Where do we put our assets?
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.740]   First, asset allocation is always most important.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:14.740]   Like if I view my strategic stock allocation is 60% stocks,
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:16.060]   I should go with that first,
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:19.700]   even if I only have 40% of my investable space
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:20.780]   in a taxable account.
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:24.700]   It's always asset allocation first,
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.580]   but then you can follow the guidelines on asset location
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.900]   about where to keep that money.
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.460]   And so when we talk about taxable
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:33.340]   versus tax-advantaged accounts,
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.180]   whether that's tax-deferred or tax-free,
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.700]   we start with, well, any tax-exempt bonds,
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.500]   there's no point in owning them anywhere
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.180]   but a taxable account.
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.740]   Then like US stock index funds
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.340]   tend to be very tax-efficient asset classes,
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:50.940]   so they can easily go into a taxable brokerage account.
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.780]   International stock index funds may have a higher dividend,
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.140]   so a little bit more taxable income coming out of it,
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.860]   but if it's low turnover, generating less taxable income.
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.500]   Like I was saying today, interest rates
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.980]   are very low right now.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:06.700]   And so because cash or bonds
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.100]   are not really generating much income,
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.300]   that unfortunately makes them very tax-efficient
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.980]   because there's no taxable income being generated.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.500]   So in a very low interest rate environment,
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.900]   bonds can actually get pushed higher up on the list,
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.460]   but in a more normal situation,
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:24.820]   bond interest is taxed as ordinary income
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.700]   on an ongoing basis.
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:30.820]   So bond funds are generally less tax-efficient,
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.380]   actively managed stock funds are less tax-efficient
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:36.740]   because of the more turnover and realized capital gain
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.900]   within the fund itself and so forth.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.180]   Then commodities and real estate investment trusts
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.260]   is being the least tax-efficient,
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.500]   most benefit from having
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.300]   some sort of tax-advantaged account.
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.980]   Then within the tax-advantaged world,
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.660]   should it go in tax-deferred or tax-exempt?
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.620]   Well, the general thought there is
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:00.380]   assets with higher expected returns
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:03.340]   can go in that Roth tax-exempt environment.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.460]   So if you have any emerging market stock funds,
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.940]   any small cap value type funds,
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.660]   a Roth is a good candidate
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.100]   for where you might wanna put that sort of thing.
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:16.380]   And then assets with lower expected returns like bonds
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.060]   or other kind of lower yielding
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.380]   but tax-inefficient asset classes
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.020]   would belong more in the tax-deferred account.
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.420]   Now, there's two reasons for that
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:29.900]   is one of the side effects of a tax-deferred account
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.860]   is if you had any long-term capital gains,
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:34.340]   their tax is ordinary income.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.780]   You lose that long-term capital gains treatment
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.260]   in the tax-deferred account,
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.740]   but you can get around that issue by having...
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.740]   In a Roth account,
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.660]   you don't have to worry about paying taxes
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:45.580]   on any of those gains.
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.420]   That's all coming out tax-free.
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:50.020]   And also to the extent that we tend to spend Roths
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.540]   later in retirement,
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.700]   having more longer-term higher yielding
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.740]   but meant to be held for the long-term type assets there
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:57.700]   can make sense.
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:03.140]   So taxable accounts for tax-efficient asset classes,
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.980]   tax-deferred for tax-inefficient lower returns,
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.620]   tax-free for tax-inefficient
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:09.500]   but higher return asset classes.
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:13.940]   Now, the tax-efficient retirement distributions
[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:16.060]   which is more our focus for this.
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:19.100]   The conventional wisdom
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.340]   on a withdrawal order sequencing strategy
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:24.660]   is to spend taxable assets first,
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:27.860]   then tax-deferred and then tax-exempt.
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:29.500]   But we can do better than that
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.500]   by using a tax bracket management framework.
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:36.220]   And so tax bracket management is,
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:40.340]   we're gonna aim to pay taxes at the lowest possible rates.
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.300]   And that means if we currently have an opportunity
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:44.740]   to generate more taxable income
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:46.700]   and pay a lower tax rate on it,
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.220]   we'll wanna do that.
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:50.580]   So we might be paying a higher tax bill
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:54.220]   because we're on purpose generating more taxable income,
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.740]   but we're doing that to pay at a lower tax rate
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.940]   and to help better set up the situation
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:50:59.860]   that in the longer term,
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:03.460]   we can better avoid the higher tax rates.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.460]   So we wanna fill up lower tax brackets with taxable income
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.060]   and potentially draw from other resources
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.700]   that are not taxed if we still wanted to spend more
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.580]   but wanted to avoid a higher tax bracket.
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.180]   That will also help with the process
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:19.740]   of required minimum distributions after age 72,
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.660]   where if we can get some of that money out before,
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.460]   we're less likely to face a big RMD
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.460]   that could push us into a higher tax bracket.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.140]   It's part of that story of short-term sacrifice.
[00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.180]   You have to pay more taxes in the short run,
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:35.460]   but by doing that at lower tax rates,
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.900]   that can create longer-term benefits.
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:39.820]   And the biggest impacts we can see for that,
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:41.900]   they both happen at around the same income levels,
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.620]   which is the point where you jump from the 12%
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.340]   to the 22% federal tax bracket,
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:50.060]   which is 40,525 for singles,
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:54.180]   $81,050 for married filing jointly.
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:55.660]   And then the preferential income,
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.420]   it jumps from zero to 15%
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:01.220]   at not quite the same numbers, but very close,
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:05.780]   40,400 for singles, 80,800 for joint filers.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.380]   So if you're able to manage a lifestyle and spending,
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.180]   especially from taxable resources
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:15.460]   and keep your taxable incomes under these thresholds,
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:17.300]   that can give you strong opportunities
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.300]   to go ahead and fill up these thresholds.
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.340]   And it's the same story for other tax brackets too.
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.980]   It's just, this is where you'll see
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.260]   the biggest impact of tax planning.
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.180]   And so this is more of a middle-class type
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.860]   retirement strategy,
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:31.500]   as opposed to like a very high net worth strategy,
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.780]   'cause these are not super high income levels
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:37.220]   from the perspective of like a high net worth type individual
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:40.540]   and there's a lot of tax advantage that can be available,
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:41.940]   especially when we start adding in
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.500]   some of the other nonlinearities in a moment.
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:49.460]   So we're talking about generating more taxable income
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:53.060]   than necessary to pay taxes at a lower tax rate.
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:56.220]   So there's three ways we can do that.
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.980]   The first is, we said the conventional wisdom
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.820]   is you spend all your taxable money first,
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:03.260]   then tax deferred and then tax free.
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:06.540]   Well, what you can do to generate more taxable income
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:10.060]   is you cut back on the distribution from the taxable account
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.660]   and replace that with the distribution
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.740]   from the tax deferred account.
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:16.020]   And so that can give you the spending you want
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:18.900]   while raising taxable income to the desired bracket
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.060]   that you're trying to manage.
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:22.740]   Second, you can cover the spending goal
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.340]   from taxable accounts,
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:26.980]   but then increase your taxable income
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:31.980]   by doing Roth conversions from the IRA to the Roth IRA.
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.100]   And then that would also,
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.580]   you can pay the taxes on those conversions,
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:39.660]   ideally from the taxable account as well, not from the IRA.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.700]   So that's an even a reason why you could accelerate payments
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.380]   out of the taxable account even faster,
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:47.660]   'cause you're using that to pay the taxes
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:49.300]   on the Roth conversions.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:50.780]   And you're using the Roth conversions
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:54.980]   to generate more taxable income in the short run.
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:57.700]   And then the third approach is to, on purpose,
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:01.180]   sell assets with long-term capital gains,
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.020]   not for any sort of market timing or anything,
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:05.700]   but you can immediately repurchase them.
[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.460]   And you're doing that to generate
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:09.820]   taxable long-term capital gains
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:13.060]   and to reset your cost basis to a higher level.
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:15.460]   And especially if you can take advantage of doing that
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.660]   when you're still in the 0% tax bracket
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.980]   for the long-term capital gains,
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.780]   and that we saw those around 40,000 for singles,
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:25.780]   80,000 for married filing jointly,
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:27.100]   you can really take advantage of that.
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:30.460]   And just you're paying taxes, but at a 0% tax rate.
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:33.460]   And so that's a very attractive feature.
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:35.740]   Then it jumps to 15 and 20%.
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:38.420]   And one of the aspects of the tax reform being discussed now
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:43.420]   is to have it 0%, 15%, and then 25%.
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.540]   And then that net investment income tax
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.140]   on top of that too, potentially.
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:51.700]   So you can work around with this.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.620]   You have resources that will create
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:55.340]   taxable income on the left.
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:58.780]   You have the income with preferential tax rates
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:00.300]   in the middle, the qualified dividends,
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.100]   long-term capital gains.
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:04.660]   And then you can have spending resources.
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:06.380]   Once you've filled up the tax bracket,
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:08.260]   if you still want more spending,
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:10.060]   you have ways to draw additional spending power
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:12.060]   without generating more taxable income.
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.780]   And that can be cost basis of your taxable account,
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.940]   Roth IRA distributions,
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:21.260]   a portion of a non-qualified annuity distribution,
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:23.580]   a portion of social security benefits,
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.180]   self-savings accounts distributions
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:29.620]   for qualified medical expenses, reverse mortgages,
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:32.220]   and also cash value from life insurance
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:35.740]   as different options for covering spending,
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:37.940]   but not having more taxable income.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:42.260]   So Roth conversions,
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:45.100]   it's the, it could be within employer plans too,
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:48.460]   but it's easiest to just say like an IRA to a Roth IRA.
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:51.940]   You cannot Roth convert required minimum distributions.
[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:54.420]   So it's gotta be an amount in excess of that.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.140]   They only begin at age 72.
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:59.860]   So you can, it's not an issue before 72,
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:01.020]   but it is after 72.
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:03.420]   You can't convert amounts that are required
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.060]   to come out as required minimum distributions.
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.940]   Like I said, ideally you wouldn't pay taxes
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.060]   from the IRA on those conversions.
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:13.820]   Hopefully you have some other resources to pay those taxes.
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.820]   Now, if you're retired by your 60s
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.940]   and you're delaying social security,
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:19.260]   that can be a great opportunity
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:21.820]   where you don't have a whole lot of taxable income
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:23.900]   to really get a strategic
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:26.100]   kind of Roth conversion strategy running.
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:29.740]   Also other times you might do this.
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.820]   If you have a year with a large tax deduction,
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:34.540]   maybe a big medical expense or something
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:37.700]   that's just a big tax deduction in a particular year,
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:41.340]   you might offset that by generating more taxable income.
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:44.780]   And then also moving more shares during a market downturn
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:45.700]   can be an opportunity.
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:49.100]   If you have other resources to pay the taxes,
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:50.260]   if the market goes down,
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:52.540]   you just have more opportunity to get money sent over
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:54.860]   to the Roth generating less taxable income.
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:58.940]   You're moving shares over at a lower value
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:00.740]   so that you're generating less taxable income
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:01.580]   when you do that.
[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:06.140]   Now, I'm talking about front-loading taxes
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:07.500]   and here's some additional reasons
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.500]   why you might like to front-load taxes
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.100]   beyond what I'm describing.
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:14.260]   And the first is just the public policy risk.
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:15.460]   A lot of people are concerned
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:17.780]   that taxes will be higher in the future.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.780]   And if that is something that concerns you,
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:21.860]   you might like to therefore accelerate
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:23.180]   some of those tax payments today
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:26.180]   when you feel like you may be in a lower tax system today
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.020]   than in the future.
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:31.580]   The death of a spouse is important as well for tax planning
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:34.900]   because after the year of the spouse's death,
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.820]   that household shifts from married filing jointly
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:38.420]   to a single filer.
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:40.140]   And those tax brackets are a lot lower.
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:43.140]   And so some expenses might go away,
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:46.660]   but income doesn't necessarily drop in half by any means.
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:48.660]   And you're gonna have a higher tax bill
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:51.020]   as a single filer than as married filing jointly.
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:52.420]   So you could have more exposure
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.620]   to paying tax on social security,
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:58.260]   more exposure to Medicare premium hikes and so forth.
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.900]   And also the SECURE Act in 2019
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:05.420]   created a lot of conversation around Roth conversions
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:09.660]   because now receiving an IRA as a beneficiary
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:11.020]   is a lot less attractive.
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:12.380]   Like if you're an adult child
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:16.780]   receiving an IRA as a beneficiary,
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.140]   you may be in your peak earnings years.
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.980]   And before the SECURE Act,
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.620]   you could use a lifetime stretch to distribute.
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:27.220]   You had inherited IRAs have required minimum distributions,
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.140]   but the rules work differently.
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.980]   You used to be able to extend those out
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:33.820]   over your life expectancy.
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:35.260]   After the SECURE Act,
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:38.700]   adult children are all gonna face the 10-year window
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:41.180]   where you have to distribute the entire account balance
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:42.700]   within 10 years.
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:46.100]   And so if that's overlapping with your highest tax years,
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:48.140]   highest earnings years,
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:50.620]   at the peak of your career at that point,
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:54.580]   that would speak to this strategic Roth conversion.
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:57.500]   If I already know that some of my IRAs may be inherited,
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.340]   'cause I'm not necessarily gonna run out of money
[00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:00.780]   at this point,
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.420]   I'm gonna be comparing my tax bracket today as a retiree
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:06.180]   to my beneficiary's tax bracket.
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:08.580]   And that might accelerate my Roth conversions.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.860]   At the same time, anything going to a charity,
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:14.100]   the IRA can be a great resource for that
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.060]   because it's the same concept of paid taxes
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:18.340]   when you're in the lowest tax bracket.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:20.180]   Anything going from an IRA to a charity
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:22.420]   can be taxed at 0%.
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:25.260]   And so you wouldn't necessarily want to convert assets
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:27.060]   that would go to charity,
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:28.660]   but you might like to convert assets
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:33.340]   that will go to a non-eligible designated beneficiary.
[00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:36.220]   So a human who doesn't get special treatment
[00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:37.660]   to have a lifetime distribution.
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:38.500]   There's still some people
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:39.940]   that can get the lifetime stretch.
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:43.900]   Spouses, well, spouses can just rename the account
[00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:45.100]   in their own name,
[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:48.780]   but also people who are less than 10 years younger
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:50.860]   than the deceased individual.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:53.580]   So perhaps siblings in that situation,
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:56.220]   permanently disabled individuals,
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:59.740]   but otherwise most human beneficiaries
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:01.700]   are going to face that 10 year window.
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:08.820]   Okay, so those are reasons
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.820]   why you might want to accelerate taxes.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.300]   Now here's some pitfalls to monitor
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.060]   when you are generating more taxable income.
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:19.580]   So there's a number of issues
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:22.420]   and I'll emphasize three of them here.
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.900]   The first is the social security tax torpedo.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:26.660]   And if you haven't heard of that before,
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:28.060]   it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:32.060]   The potential for increased Medicare Part B
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.020]   and Part D premiums,
[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:39.020]   pushing preferential income into higher tax brackets.
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.220]   So pushing more into a higher tax bracket,
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.500]   I'll explain that.
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.580]   And then some others that I'm not getting into now,
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:48.660]   but also if you're pre-Medicare age
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.620]   and you have a Affordable Care Act,
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:52.180]   health insurance policy,
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.740]   subsidies could be jeopardized,
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:56.980]   although there was in 2021 and 2022,
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.300]   this is not an issue.
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.620]   The subsidy cliff there was taken away,
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:03.180]   but it returns in 2023,
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:08.180]   where if your income goes $1 above 400% of the poverty line,
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.660]   you suddenly lose all subsidies for the health insurance.
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:16.100]   The net investment income surtax, that 3.8%.
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.180]   The additional Medicare taxes on higher earnings
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.780]   and the alternative minimum tax
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.620]   are all kind of pitfalls of generating more taxable income.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.140]   But again, we'll focus on those first three
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.540]   with the boxes next to them.
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:30.260]   So the social security tax torpedo.
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:35.060]   Up to 85% of your social security benefits are taxable.
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:38.780]   The tax schedule to determine
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.940]   how much of your social security is taxable
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.620]   was designed in 1994.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.940]   And it's one of those rare parts of the tax code
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.340]   that's not inflation adjusted.
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:50.500]   So those numbers have been the same since 1994.
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.460]   And that just means over time with inflation,
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:55.340]   more people are gonna be hit by taxes
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.180]   on their social security benefits.
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:01.140]   Determining the benefit taxation
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:04.300]   and then the marginal tax rate is quite complex.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:07.340]   And this is where the people who designed
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:09.660]   how social security will be taxed,
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:10.740]   I don't know how they could have created
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:13.260]   a more difficult situation than they did.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:15.860]   I had to spend days just with the programming on this
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.940]   to make sure I wasn't making mistakes and everything
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.500]   because you calculate three different numbers,
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:21.540]   see which is smallest.
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.980]   And there's so many nonlinearities here,
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:28.580]   but we'll walk through what's going on in just a moment.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:30.140]   And then proactive planning can help
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:32.580]   to potentially avoid the full tax torpedo
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:35.100]   that you may be able to set up so you're not paying taxes
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.980]   on 85% of your social security benefits.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:40.820]   It might be hard to get that down to 0%,
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:43.580]   but if you can pay taxes on 20% of your benefits
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.020]   instead of 85% of your benefits, that could be a big win.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:49.860]   And that's gonna be a key part of what's helping
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:52.620]   when I talk about the tax efficient strategy
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:55.220]   adding so many years of portfolio longevity.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:59.580]   And a key point, if I was giving a presentation
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:02.180]   about social security, a key message would be
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.100]   to think about delaying towards age 70
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.660]   to take advantage of the insurance value,
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:09.900]   the inflation protection, the survival benefits.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.700]   And this whole tax planning discussion
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.820]   is just another reason to consider
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:15.740]   delaying social security towards,
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:17.740]   at least for the higher earner in a couple,
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.660]   towards age 70 and for a single individual.
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:22.780]   The lower earner might claim earlier in a couple,
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:24.620]   but not the higher earner.
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:29.780]   Okay, so this is where things start to get tricky
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.300]   with the social security tax torpedo.
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.740]   So there's gonna be a bunch of different
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.660]   modified adjusted gross income numbers.
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.060]   And if you look into the tax rules,
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.820]   the definitions will be quite long,
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.460]   but there's a bunch of small things
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:42.660]   that probably don't affect most people.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.820]   When we talk about social security,
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.820]   the basic idea of the social security
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:49.100]   modified adjusted gross income is,
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.460]   it's your adjusted gross income
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:53.260]   less your taxable social security benefits.
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:56.580]   And you don't know what percent of,
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:57.700]   that's what makes it so hard here,
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.700]   is you're not gonna know what percent
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.420]   of your benefits are taxable
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.820]   until you've figured all this stuff out.
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.700]   So you kind of have to work through a loop.
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.060]   But your provisional income,
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.900]   and it's sometimes called combined income
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.660]   based on the source,
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:14.220]   it's that social security modified adjusted gross income.
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:15.900]   So it's your adjusted gross income
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.660]   less your taxable social security benefits,
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.740]   but then plus half of your benefits.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:23.220]   So you're putting half of the benefits back into this.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.180]   And then also any tax exempt interest
[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:27.780]   is gonna be added as well into this number.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.820]   And then this is what we're working with
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:34.620]   in terms of those 1994 thresholds
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:37.460]   to determine how much of your social security benefits
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:38.540]   will be taxable.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.820]   And these are not like taxable incomes.
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.060]   These are that provisional income,
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:43.860]   which is that unusual measure
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:47.700]   that includes half of your social security benefit.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:53.500]   So this is what the tax torpedo would look like.
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.100]   Every social security benefit has a different tax torpedo,
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.900]   every level of benefit.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.780]   So if you had 30, so a single filer 2021
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:05.940]   with a $30,000 annual social security benefit,
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.500]   what we're graphing on the bottom is your,
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.700]   it's like all your income except social security.
[01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:12.780]   So it's that your adjusted gross income
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.300]   minus your taxable social security
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.420]   plus your tax exempt interest.
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.100]   And then we're looking at your marginal tax rates.
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:24.100]   And those jump up to be 12%, 22% and so on with the yellow.
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.260]   And then the purple is looking at social security,
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:29.620]   what's your marginal tax rate?
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.740]   And you can see, you may have thought,
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.260]   well, by the time you added social security,
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.300]   you may have thought you were gonna be
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:36.780]   in the 22% tax bracket,
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.420]   but there's a little period there
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:43.180]   where you're actually paying a marginal tax rate of 40.7%.
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.660]   And that's the social security tax torpedo.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:49.300]   That's where at these kinds of income levels,
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:52.300]   you may be paying a much higher tax rate than you expected.
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:58.260]   And so what's happening in that is you're a dollar of income
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:00.980]   when you're in that range identified there
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:04.980]   up to that 43,000 plus, you're a dollar of income,
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:09.580]   you're gonna pay tax at 22%, 22% on that dollar,
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:12.780]   plus that's gonna uniquely trigger a dollar
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:15.980]   of your social security to be taxed at 85%.
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:20.780]   So 22% of 85% of a dollar of social security.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:24.060]   And so those add up to 40.7%.
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.100]   And that's now your marginal tax rate.
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.020]   A dollar of income, you're paying taxes not just on that,
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.620]   but it's also pushing another dollar
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:34.020]   of your social security to be taxed at 85%.
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:36.140]   And that torpedo jumps around
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:39.020]   because there's just where you are with the tax brackets,
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:40.900]   it's jumping around at different places.
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:43.900]   But that 40.7% is the highest it gets.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.460]   And that's in that range where it's pushing you
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:52.460]   into paying tax on 85 cents of a dollar of social security.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.860]   And with this benefit level that adds up
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:57.660]   or that happens up into an adjusted gross income
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:02.300]   of $69,206, which if you took a standard deduction
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.740]   off of that, we're talking about a taxable income
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:09.420]   of $56,806 if you're under age 65.
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:12.660]   So that income's just below that range.
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:16.180]   You're at a 40.7% marginal tax rate,
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:17.980]   even though you were expecting to be
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:20.140]   in the 22% marginal tax rate.
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:24.180]   The next thing is Medicare,
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:27.580]   the income-related Medicare adjustment amount,
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.900]   adjustments, adjustment amounts,
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:33.660]   the premium increases that work differently.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:37.220]   And this is where you have to pay higher premiums
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.460]   for Part B Medicare,
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:43.380]   as well as if you have a prescription Part D drug plan,
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:45.020]   Part D as well.
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.860]   And those premiums just jump at different income thresholds.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:51.220]   Now your Medicare modified adjusted gross income
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.900]   is your adjusted gross income,
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:55.340]   plus a bunch of minor things,
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:58.260]   but the main one is just that tax exempt interest.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:00.900]   But the tricky thing there is it's from two years prior,
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.020]   not from the current year.
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:06.420]   Now, two years ago up to today, things can change.
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.220]   So if you do have a life-changing event,
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:12.100]   such as you retired and don't have earned income anymore,
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.460]   you can file Form SSA-44
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:18.180]   and request not to have that IRMA premium hike
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:21.780]   and see that there's a whole list of valid excuses.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.460]   Just doing a strategic Roth conversion
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.100]   is not a valid excuse,
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.660]   so you will be stuck with any higher Medicare premiums
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:28.980]   that generates.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.020]   But in some cases, you might have a valid reason
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.420]   to request not having those premium hikes.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:35.900]   But how this plays out is,
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.860]   so if you're a single
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:41.180]   and your modified adjusted gross income is $88,000,
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.380]   your total premiums for the year,
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.100]   and I'll show that better on the next slide,
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:47.660]   about $2,179,
[01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:49.380]   one more dollar of income
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:55.380]   causes you to face annual premium increases of $860 in 2021.
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:09:01.340]   So that is an 86,000% marginal tax rate
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.740]   on that dollar of income.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.980]   And then it goes back down again beyond that.
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:08.940]   But this is working differently than the tax torpedo.
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.780]   This is, if you have $1 too much,
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.580]   you're gonna trigger a big additional premium hike
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:15.460]   for that year.
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.460]   Well, not, I mean, for two years later.
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:19.220]   In two years, you're gonna trigger
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.460]   a big additional premium hike.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.580]   And so this becomes relevant.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.660]   Even if you start Medicare at 65,
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:28.500]   this starts to become an issue with your income at 63.
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:33.220]   And so here's the table for 2021.
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:36.780]   So this is based on incomes in 2019.
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:39.380]   And here you can see the thresholds for single filers
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.300]   marry filing jointly.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:44.940]   You have standardized Part B Medicare premiums
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:46.660]   for the medical insurance.
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:49.060]   Part D can vary, but this is gonna be based
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:52.020]   on the average Part D premium in 2021,
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:55.100]   which was $33.06 per month.
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.500]   And so those are monthly numbers,
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.620]   but then the number on the right is annual.
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:04.620]   So it's the Part B plus the Part D times 12,
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:05.900]   and that's per individual.
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:08.900]   So married couples would have to double those numbers.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:13.500]   And you can see that once you get $1 higher
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:17.140]   into that second one, it's $860 more,
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:23.220]   21.78 or 21.79 per year up to 3,039 per year.
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:26.700]   And that is, again, the next premium jump,
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.740]   it's at $111,001 for singles,
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:33.580]   $222,000 for couples married filing jointly.
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:36.380]   And then you're jumping up by another $1,300
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.020]   of annual premiums.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:41.140]   And so it's just that $1 of income is triggering
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:43.260]   the big increase in Medicare premiums.
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:44.860]   And so that's something to be aware of.
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:48.660]   Now, if you have to occasionally generate,
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:50.540]   trigger one Medicare hike,
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.940]   it might be worthwhile in the long run,
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:55.540]   but you wanna be careful about making ongoing mistakes
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:57.420]   where you accidentally just trigger slightly
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:00.100]   too much income and therefore have to deal
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:03.180]   with a much bigger Medicare premium two years later.
[01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:08.900]   And then we have this preferential income issue.
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:10.460]   So your long-term capital gains
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:12.140]   and your qualified dividends stack
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.860]   on top of your other taxable income.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:19.260]   And so here's an example to illustrate the basic idea.
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.860]   We have a single individual,
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:24.100]   their taxable income is $42,400,
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:28.380]   but that's divided, they have 38,400 as ordinary income,
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:31.180]   4,000 as long-term capital gains.
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:35.340]   So taxes on that, the 38,400,
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:37.780]   they're still in the 12% federal income tax bracket
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:39.780]   on their ordinary income.
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:42.740]   And then they stack the 4,000 on top of that,
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:45.500]   2,000 of that will be taxed at 0%
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:48.940]   and 2,000 of that will be taxed at 15%.
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:52.900]   Now, suppose they add $1 more of ordinary income.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:56.700]   So they have $38,401 of ordinary income.
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:00.620]   That they have to pay 12% tax on that dollar,
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:02.860]   but look at what else it does.
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:05.500]   They now have one less dollar being taxed at 0%
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.740]   for their long-term capital gains
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.900]   and one more dollar being taxed at 15%.
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:12.620]   So they're paying 15%
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:16.060]   on that long-term capital gain dollar also.
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:17.180]   So they thought they were
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:20.300]   in the 12% federal income tax bracket,
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:24.060]   but they're actually paying a 27% marginal tax rate
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:26.020]   on that dollar of income.
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.500]   And where that can get really fun
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:28.940]   is that when it also overlaps
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:31.460]   with the Social Security tax torpedo.
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:35.300]   So that 47%, you can add another 15% on that
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.860]   if you're also having the same issue happen
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.700]   where you're triggering another dollar
[01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:42.940]   to be taxed at 15% on the long-term capital gains.
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:47.940]   Now you're at like a 55.7% federal marginal tax bracket.
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:49.940]   So even though we may think taxes
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.380]   will be less in retirement,
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:53.780]   if we're not planning for this,
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:56.700]   taxes can be quite a bit higher than we expect
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:59.020]   when these circumstances are triggered.
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:04.340]   Okay, so let's now see how this plays out with an example.
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:10.780]   And this example, it's a 60-year-old single individual.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:12.500]   I'll refer to her as she,
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.580]   although gender doesn't matter for the example,
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:16.500]   that just makes it easier to stick with one.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.100]   So she's 60 years old.
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.980]   We're simplifying investment returns.
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:23.460]   She's basically investing in bonds.
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:26.980]   I just assume inflation is zero to not,
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:28.780]   'cause I wanna show all their future tax numbers
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.780]   and to not have to worry about inflation
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:34.140]   and how that impacts what those numbers mean.
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:36.300]   I think it helps to make it more easy
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:37.340]   to interpret the results
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:39.540]   if we just assume there's no inflation,
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.460]   but she is getting a 2% real return.
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.980]   So all of her assets are growing at 2% a year.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:49.260]   Now she's got 400,000 in her taxable account,
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:54.180]   1.3 million in tax-deferred and 300,000 in tax-exempt.
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:58.380]   She wants to spend $95,000 a year pre-tax.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:00.380]   So that is, this came up at the bow of the heads.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:01.820]   That is more than 4%.
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.740]   But also she's gonna have,
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.340]   something like the 4%, really,
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:08.100]   that rule never can be used in practice
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:10.380]   just because no one actually spends a constant amount
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:11.700]   from their portfolio every year.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.500]   You always have to deal with,
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:14.980]   we're not doing anything complicated here.
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:17.780]   She always wants to spend $95,000,
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:18.620]   but at some point,
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.860]   social security is gonna kick in for her.
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:23.460]   And also taxes are gonna go on top of that.
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.100]   And if she doesn't have constant taxes every year,
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:28.260]   there's no constant distribution amount
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.100]   from her investments.
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:32.220]   She does have a nice, smooth spending goal,
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:34.180]   but taxes go on top of that.
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:35.060]   And then at some point,
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:36.420]   social security will come into play.
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:39.180]   If she claims that that's her primary insurance amount,
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:41.580]   her full retirement age is 67.
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.380]   So if she claims at 62,
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:46.900]   she'll get $21,000 a year from social security.
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.260]   If she claims at age 70,
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:52.780]   she'll get $37,200 a year from social security.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:56.900]   Now there's five strategies I do look at
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:57.820]   in the book chapter.
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:00.500]   And for this, we'll focus on one in five,
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.140]   the first and the last.
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:04.220]   But let me just walk through these.
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:06.100]   The first strategy,
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:08.900]   she's gonna claim social security at 62,
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:10.860]   and she'll follow that taxable, tax-deferred,
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:14.020]   tax-free distribution strategy.
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:16.940]   Her money, she'll be able to meet that spending goal
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:19.180]   for 28.99 years.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.940]   Then her money runs out, no more investment assets.
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:25.220]   And then she'll continue to have social security at $21,000.
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:27.260]   Now, strategy number two,
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:28.980]   she doesn't change her tax strategy,
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:33.340]   but if she just delays social security at 70, until 70,
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:37.940]   that will increase 1.86 years onto her portfolio longevity.
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:42.340]   Her money will last 1.86 years longer.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:45.860]   Okay, and that's the benefit of delaying social security.
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:47.500]   Now, the rest of these strategies
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:50.060]   all have social security at 70,
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.940]   but they're adding more sophistication with the taxes.
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:56.180]   So strategy three is,
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:59.140]   they're going to do tax bracket management, she will do,
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.580]   but without Roth conversions.
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:03.540]   She's just going to spend less from taxable,
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.380]   more from tax-deferred,
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:09.220]   to manage an adjusted gross income of $60,000.
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.220]   And a little bit later,
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:12.340]   I'll show you the charts of how I come up with that number.
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:15.140]   I think that is something I haven't seen elsewhere
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:16.540]   in doing this.
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.740]   I checked every adjusted gross income level
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:22.500]   and see which one gave her the most portfolio longevity.
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:26.220]   And so managing $60,000 was the amount that worked best
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:28.660]   to give her the most portfolio longevity.
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:31.980]   And that gave her 3.83 more years
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:34.100]   than the baseline strategy,
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:37.620]   or almost two more years than just delaying social security.
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:41.100]   So an additional two years of portfolio longevity
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.460]   by being more tax-efficient.
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:47.300]   Strategy four, she's now going to do Roth conversions.
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:49.380]   And coincidentally,
[01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:51.300]   the same adjusted gross income level
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.820]   would maximize her portfolio longevity.
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.860]   And that's getting her about four and a half years longer
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:59.340]   than the baseline strategy one.
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:01.540]   And then strategy five,
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:04.820]   she's gonna do a two-part strategy.
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.180]   She's 60 years old right now.
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:07.580]   So until she's 69,
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:10.140]   for the first 10 years of her retirement,
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:12.260]   she's gonna manage an adjusted gross income
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:16.260]   that goes right up to the second Medicare threshold.
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:18.580]   So she will have a higher Medicare premiums
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:22.980]   starting at age 65 for one threshold,
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:26.180]   but she's gonna go up to just before the second threshold.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:28.940]   Then she'll stop doing that when she turns 70.
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:32.860]   So the year she starts collecting social security,
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.860]   she's already done such a big Roth conversion strategy
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:37.020]   by that point.
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.660]   But now for the rest of her retirement,
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:42.300]   she can manage $25,000 of adjusted gross income,
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:44.860]   have much less of her social security be taxed,
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.980]   and her money lasts 5.6 years longer than in the baseline.
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:51.460]   Okay, so that's what we're walking through here.
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:56.100]   So this is the claim at 62,
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:58.500]   claim social security at 62,
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:01.620]   conventional wisdom taxable, tax deferred, tax free.
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.860]   And I'm sorry if your monitor is not so big,
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:05.740]   you might not see these numbers very well,
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:09.060]   but let me just kind of tell the story of what's happening.
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:11.500]   This is her whole like retirement situation
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:15.020]   as she's spending down from her taxable account,
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:17.140]   the tax deferred account, tax exempt account.
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:19.660]   So you're seeing the account balances on the left,
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:22.700]   the amount distributed from each of the accounts each year
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:26.380]   under the spending, her social security benefits,
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:28.780]   her required minimum distribution amounts.
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:30.420]   They're never binding in this example.
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:32.820]   She always wants to take out more from her tax deferred
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:35.660]   than the required minimum distribution.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:39.380]   Roth conversions, her adjusted gross income,
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:40.460]   and then her taxable income,
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:43.860]   which would just take the standard deduction off of that,
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:46.500]   the amount of her social security that's taxable,
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.380]   and then her federal income tax bill.
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:52.500]   So this strategy, the first years of retirement
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:56.180]   through age 64, she's just spending her taxable account.
[01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.940]   And I was assuming her cost basis matched her account value.
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:02.300]   So she's not really generating much taxable income.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.460]   She does have the 2% interest every year
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:06.260]   in her adjusted gross income,
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:09.380]   but it's nowhere near the amount of her standard deduction.
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:12.700]   So she's paying 0% federal income taxes,
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.900]   but she's wasting tax capacity.
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:17.260]   She could have at least generated taxable income
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:22.220]   up to the standard deduction and still had 0% tax rates,
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:23.740]   whether she went beyond that is up to her,
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:25.460]   but she could have generated more taxable income
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:28.820]   without actually generating any taxes.
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:32.460]   But then she gets into trouble around age 65,
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:34.820]   'cause this is where she switches
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:36.660]   to just spending from tax deferred.
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:41.620]   And to meet her spending goal and pay her tax bill,
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:43.780]   that's pushing her up to an adjusted gross income
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:46.940]   of $115,000 for most of those years.
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:50.180]   That's into that second Medicare threshold for her.
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:53.460]   So she's looking at more than 2,000 additional dollars
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:54.820]   of Medicare premiums.
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:58.140]   And I'm just adding that to the federal income tax numbers.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:01.220]   So when she's spending from her tax deferred account,
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:03.860]   she's being taxed on 85% of her social security.
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:07.540]   That's the 17,850 out of 21,000.
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:11.220]   And she has more than $20,000 of taxes for a long time,
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:13.460]   all the way through age 82.
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.460]   That's when she runs out of tax deferred account
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:17.820]   and start spending from her tax exempt account.
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.860]   Then she's back to the issue where she just,
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:22.580]   she doesn't have any taxable income at this point.
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.620]   She still has to pay those higher Medicare premiums.
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:29.620]   That's that age 83 tax bill of the $2,164.
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:32.020]   That's just that additional Medicare premium
[01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:34.620]   based on her income at age 81.
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:37.700]   But after that, she doesn't have any more taxes.
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.060]   Her adjusted gross income is zero.
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:40.780]   She's just spending from her Roth.
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:43.340]   She doesn't have taxes,
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:46.380]   but she's wasting tax bracket space again.
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:48.140]   And she ends up running out of money
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:50.740]   before she turns 89 years old.
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:53.460]   And then at ages 89 and higher,
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:57.540]   she's able to spend her $21,000 of social security benefits.
[01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.780]   That's not enough to trigger taxes.
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:01.620]   So it's not even above the,
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:05.820]   sorry, it might be above the standard deduction.
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:07.580]   I was kind of thinking of the joint one when I was talking,
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:11.380]   but anyway, she's not triggering any taxable income.
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:14.820]   It is well below those thresholds for provisional income.
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:18.500]   So she had a lot of taxes between ages 65
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.700]   up to about age 82,
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:22.700]   and that really disrupted her retirement.
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:26.300]   She can do better than this to have that money last longer.
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:29.900]   And these were, what I was saying,
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.940]   I test every level of adjusted gross income,
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:35.540]   see how long the portfolio lasts.
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:36.420]   And that's where I find
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:39.300]   like a tax bracket management strategy.
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:43.220]   $60,000 of adjusted gross income claim at 70
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:46.420]   is giving her the most portfolio longevity there.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:48.780]   And that's why I picked that as the standard.
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.180]   If you look at $60,000,
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:53.420]   that's where that curve gets the highest
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:54.940]   on the top purple curve
[01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:57.820]   for the Roth conversions, social security at 70.
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:03.180]   And then this is just a matter of like trial and error
[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:05.100]   of saying, well, what if she did two different things?
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:08.060]   What if she managed an even higher level
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:12.780]   before social security begins and then reduce after that?
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:14.820]   And this is where she's going right up to the threshold
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.420]   of where her social security
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:19.020]   or her Medicare would be taxed two times,
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:21.180]   into two of those thresholds.
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:23.300]   In reality, you probably wouldn't wanna go this close
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:24.740]   because one more dollar of income
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:28.140]   would accidentally trigger the higher Medicare premium.
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:30.780]   So you might kind of build in a buffer of $1,000.
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.740]   But the basic idea,
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:34.940]   you're gonna pay more taxes early on,
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:37.540]   but then after age 70,
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:40.220]   you're gonna manage a $25,000 tax bracket.
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:42.300]   And that gives you the most portfolio longevity
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:44.420]   in that bifurcated strategy.
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:48.740]   And here's how the tax situation plays out
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:51.900]   with this most tax efficient version.
[01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:55.420]   With this, she's gonna do Roth conversions early on.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:23:00.340]   So she's spending from her taxable account.
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.740]   She's paying taxes from her taxable account.
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:05.140]   She's then doing Roth conversions
[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:10.140]   up to manage that $111,000 of adjusted gross income.
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:11.100]   And then she's gonna have
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:13.700]   a higher federal income tax bill in those early years.
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:17.860]   Her taxable account depletes by age 64.
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:20.900]   Then she doesn't do Roth conversions anymore
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:23.380]   'cause she doesn't have a way to really pay the taxes
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:24.220]   on that.
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:26.460]   So she's taking $111,000 out to spend
[01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:28.420]   from her tax deferred account.
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.220]   That doesn't meet the full amount she needs
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:31.300]   to cover her taxes.
[01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:34.700]   So she's taking a bit more out of her tax exempt account
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:36.020]   at that point.
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:40.180]   And she continues to pay those high taxes up until age 70.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.820]   Then her social security begins.
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:48.220]   And then she's able to, at that point forward,
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:51.340]   manage $25,000 of adjusted gross income.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:55.140]   That's going to dramatically reduce her tax bill.
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:56.700]   She does have the one year there
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:59.740]   where she's paying the higher Medicare premium again,
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:00.580]   or one or two years.
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:02.580]   I've got that part of my screen covered
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.420]   with everybody's pictures here.
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:10.420]   But at some point then, her taxes dropped down to 1,460.
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.100]   And that's just based on,
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:17.100]   you can see her social security, $6,843 is taxable
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:21.100]   out of the benefit of $37,200.
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:23.700]   So she's paying taxes on a much smaller percent
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:25.820]   of her social security benefit.
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:26.980]   That's helping a lot.
[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:29.380]   She front loaded her taxes.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:33.460]   But after age 70, it's smooth sailing.
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:34.900]   She's able to take much less
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:36.940]   out of her tax deferred account at that point,
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:39.700]   blend it more with her Roth account distributions
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.300]   and her higher social security benefit.
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:45.100]   And her money lasts until she's 94.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:47.660]   And then after it does run out at that point,
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:50.060]   she still has that higher social security benefit.
[01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:54.220]   So it's, I mean, her money lasts 5.6 years longer.
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.500]   And even if she does run out,
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:00.820]   she still has 77% more coming out of social security.
[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:04.140]   So that's kind of how this fits together to work better
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:07.140]   for her to help manage in particular.
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:08.780]   Well, in that first example,
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:12.420]   she was paying two bumps up the Medicare brackets
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:14.740]   as well as 85% on her social security.
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:17.660]   She was wasting tax capacity.
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:21.020]   Here, she's front loading her taxes
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:22.900]   and setting herself up very well.
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:25.460]   So once her social security begins,
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:27.620]   not much of it is taxable
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:30.660]   and she gets to pay lower taxes for the rest of her life.
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:34.220]   And that's what's generating more portfolio longevity
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:35.620]   for her in this example.
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:39.820]   So key ideas coming out of all this,
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:41.980]   the progressive tax code in the US
[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:44.700]   and all those various pitfalls I talked about
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:48.180]   really can have an impact on your marginal tax rates.
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.820]   And so it can make this kind of planning important.
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:52.300]   So setting up pre-retirement
[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:55.460]   with tax diversification and asset location.
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:57.300]   And then as you enter into retirement,
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:59.660]   thinking about social security claiming
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:03.140]   and how that impacts as well with managing tax brackets
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.140]   and potentially conducting
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:06.020]   a strategic Roth conversion strategy.
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:10.660]   Again, for money that you don't anticipate going to charity
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:11.860]   can lay the foundation
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:15.260]   for a much stronger retirement income plan in that regard.
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:18.900]   So again, the book, chapter 10 of the book,
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:20.340]   that's more than 70 pages
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:22.820]   about what I was talking about right now.
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:25.180]   And let me go ahead and wrap up.
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.620]   Let me show you that disclosure,
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:30.020]   but otherwise we can go ahead and wrap up there
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:32.100]   and get into the questions again.
[01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:32.940]   So thank you.
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:35.020]   - Thank you, Wei.
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:35.860]   That was wonderful.
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:37.940]   I'm gonna go ahead and pause the recording here
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:39.820]   so we can take our questions.
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:45.900]   - Okay, Wei, we just wanna thank you once again
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:48.020]   for your time and expertise.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:51.860]   These are pretty thought-provoking discussions
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:56.340]   that we as retirees certainly are trying to maneuver
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:27:00.700]   at a time where things should become simpler
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:02.780]   and they become more complex.
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:05.540]   And so we appreciate your insight
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:09.260]   into these issues that we're all gonna have to face
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:10.780]   to some degree.
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:15.620]   And again, we thank you for the work you put into the book
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.260]   where we can kind of ponder it a little bit more,
[01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:20.380]   but thanks again.
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:22.260]   We really appreciate it. - Okay, my pleasure.
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:25.100]   - By the way, Wei, will you make your slides available
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.500]   for the Bogleheads possibly?
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.940]   - Yeah, I can do that.
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:29.780]   - Okay.
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:31.100]   - Let me make a little note to remind myself.
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:33.860]   - Lady Geek will post that on the forum.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:37.060]   I also wanna thank, in addition to Robert,
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:39.340]   for doing a superb job in getting this organized.
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:42.500]   Also, Henry and Raj helped out behind the scenes
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:46.140]   with their input and perspectives.
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:47.420]   We appreciate that.
[01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:48.660]   As a reminder for everybody,
[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:51.380]   we now have a Bogleheads YouTube channel.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:53.580]   Once we have this recording edited,
[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:55.180]   we'll have it posted up there.
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:58.380]   Also, I advise everybody to please bookmark
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:00.700]   the Bogleheads calendar of events,
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:03.700]   which is in the blog section of the forum
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:05.660]   to see all the upcoming local
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:08.340]   and chapter national meetings as well.
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:10.060]   But with YouTube channel now also has
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.620]   the Bogleheads on investing podcasts.
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.300]   They're being uploaded as well with Rick Ferry.
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:16.940]   Again, thank you so much, Wei.
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:18.500]   This was a phenomenal presentation.
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:19.780]   We appreciate your efforts,
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:21.140]   especially after having done a webinar
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.740]   already this afternoon.
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:26.020]   And it definitely gave us a tremendous food for thought
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:28.380]   and piqued our curiosity to investigate this further
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:31.100]   with the book and other resources you have to offer.
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:34.020]   So, thank you very much.
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:34.860]   - Thank you.
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:35.700]   - Thank you, everybody.
[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:36.540]   - Thank you.
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:39.140]   (upbeat music)
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:42.540]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:45.940]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:50.220]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:53.820]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:56.400]   (upbeat music)
