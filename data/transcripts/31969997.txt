[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.300]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.160]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.980]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.000]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.280]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.480]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.840]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.000]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.600]   this homeschooling possibility or deep into
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.400]   the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.880]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.880]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.000]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.600]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.520]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.360]   Well, listeners, I'm super excited
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.480]   that we are in the midst of summer
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.640]   and in the midst of our summer book club,
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.160]   and I have enjoyed reading stories along with you
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.040]   from the readers that will go along
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.840]   with our Cycle One Foundation's memory work in the fall.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.320]   It's somehow fun to get a jump on things
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.320]   that we will be learning together, learning about together,
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.920]   in the fall, and it's kind of fun to get a preview
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.000]   of those stories so that some of the characters
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.320]   and some of the situations will be familiar
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.480]   when we approach them again together in the fall.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.680]   But even more than that, you guys,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.200]   I just really love reading aloud as a family,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.560]   and I really enjoy encouraging young moms and dads
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.360]   and older moms and dads and young and old kids alike
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.700]   to take some time to read aloud together
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.260]   over the summer months.
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.240]   Now, I know that some people have a different idea
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.180]   of reading than I do,
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.180]   and maybe reading sounds like a passive activity
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.440]   to some people, and maybe you are not fond
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.840]   of slow, passive activities,
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.800]   or maybe your kids are not really fond of that
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.520]   and they really wanna use the summer to be active
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.400]   and to run around and to do something and to play things
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.320]   and to do different things.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.960]   I'm here to tell you
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.000]   that reading does not have to be passive.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.720]   I know it conjures up for some the picture
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.520]   of quietly sitting, turning pages as needed,
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.540]   but not moving much otherwise.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   Even reading aloud where one person is making noise,
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.480]   reading aloud might sound like a low-movement moment.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.280]   For some kids and some families,
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.720]   that makes reading together less appealing.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.360]   While snuggling in with a book and a fire
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.080]   and some hot cocoa sounds pretty good on a cold winter day,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.480]   reading aloud might sound like too much stillness
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.720]   for summer.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.720]   But who says reading aloud means sitting still?
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.840]   I would like to suggest some active listening ideas
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.920]   for those of you who struggle to sell read aloud time
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.600]   to your active kids,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   or even to your make-the-most-of-summer selves.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.280]   Listen, reading can be done anywhere.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.160]   It can be inside, sure,
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.380]   but it can be outside, on the porch,
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.960]   on a swing, at the zoo,
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.040]   with your feet dangling in the creek,
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.120]   eating ice cream in the park.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.480]   Look, my point is take your book with you
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.840]   wherever you're going,
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.840]   whatever you're planning to do during the day,
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.680]   take your book with you.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.840]   Finding a different venue for your story
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.560]   makes reading aloud something new to do.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.560]   It gives you all something new to see as you listen,
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.680]   and who knows, might provoke new thoughts in your listeners.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.920]   So take your books on vacation.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.340]   Take your books when you run errands.
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.720]   Take your books when you're gonna meet somebody at the park.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.040]   You know that there's always gonna be a moment
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.800]   when everybody is too hot to breathe,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.060]   too tired to play another game,
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.040]   and everybody just needs a rest.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.520]   Whip out your story.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.100]   Whip out your book.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.480]   Invite your listeners into a story
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.080]   and take a moment to read.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.480]   Another thing,
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.840]   your kids can, I mean, usually listen to a story
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.120]   while they do something else.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.920]   My kids used to like to listen to stories
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.280]   that I read to them while they were doing chores.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   I don't know if it just made the chore less unappealing,
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.200]   made the time pass faster,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.560]   gave their mind something to chew on
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.120]   as they did a mindless task,
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.840]   but I can remember sitting in the hall,
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.480]   in the hallway between their two rooms
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.040]   when they were cleaning their room,
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.280]   and I would read aloud as they cleaned.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.280]   And I would read only as long as they were moving.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.440]   So if I looked in and they had become lost in thought
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.160]   or lost in the story, I stopped reading.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.600]   So as long as they were moving, I kept reading.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.160]   Look, here's the truth.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.640]   Some kids listen better
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.400]   when they have some way to get the wiggles out.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.720]   You can let them ride a bike or a tricycle
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.320]   around in a circle while they're listening.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.160]   You can let them or encourage them
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.640]   to doodle or draw on paper.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.120]   Shoot, you can have them hop on one leg
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.520]   and then on the other leg
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.440]   while they're listening to a short fable.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.440]   You can have your kids dig in the sandbox
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.920]   or dig in a flower pot or dig in the yard.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.880]   Depending on what you're reading,
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.600]   I mean, it might be a fairy tale or a fable.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.640]   It might be a nature journal.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.120]   It might be a cookbook.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.920]   Depending on what you're reading,
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.440]   you can actually make what they're doing
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.520]   part of what they're hearing.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.520]   I mean, they could design a fairy creature house
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.200]   on paper or with chalk.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   They could watch ants build a mound.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.640]   They could stir up the cupcakes that you are describing.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.020]   You'll be able to tell if they're still listening
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.160]   as you learn to ask questions along the way
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.600]   and as you enjoy some conversation
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.920]   after the reading is done.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.080]   This summer, we've been working together
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.240]   on ways to prime that conversational pump
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.400]   and continue the pleasure of the stories
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.160]   that we're reading together.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.560]   So today, let's listen to a few more stories
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.560]   from our Copper Lodge Library Edition, Kings of Rome.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.600]   And then I'm gonna give you a few more suggestions
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   for great conversations.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.160]   So the stories that I want to read you today,
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.000]   they're three stories and they're short.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.160]   And this is what I want you to realize.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.320]   Some of these stories are super short.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.320]   They might only be a page or two in the Kings of Rome book
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.080]   and you can read them one at a time
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.760]   or you can bundle two or three together as we'll do today.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.880]   We have already read a couple, maybe three weeks ago,
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.800]   we read a couple of stories
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.360]   from the beginning of Kings of Rome.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.360]   And we had already met the characters, Romulus and Remus.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.200]   And we had discovered that they had been sort of banished
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.000]   and they are actually, though they are princes,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.880]   have been serving as shepherds.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.960]   Yep, shepherds.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   And their grandfather, who had been the king,
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.880]   has been kind of exiled himself.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.640]   And so we're picking up the threads of the story today.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.640]   Numitor recognizes his grandsons.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.800]   Okay, here we go.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.120]   The young prisoner was brought before Numitor
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.240]   in the city of Alba.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.840]   No sooner had the old man's eyes fallen on the lad
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.040]   than he threw up his hands in a maze
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.560]   and gazed more keenly at the prisoner.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:38.560]   "No herdsman this," muttered the old king to himself,
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.160]   "rather does he bear himself as a prince."
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.000]   Scanning the face before him even more closely,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.840]   it seemed to Numitor that the features
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.040]   were not unknown to him.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:59.040]   Dreams of his lost daughter, Sylvia, gladdened his heart.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:04.480]   Gently, the old man tried to win the confidence of the lad,
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.480]   asking him who he was and whence he came.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.280]   Remus was touched by the kindness of Numitor and answered,
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.240]   "I will hide nothing from you, sire,
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.560]   for you seem of a princely temper
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:26.520]   in that you give a hearing and examine before you punish."
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.880]   Then he told the story that Faustulus
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.720]   had often told to him and Romulus
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.040]   of how the wolf had found them as babes
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.440]   on the banks of the river Tiber
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.040]   and had carried them to her cave
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.800]   and fed them with her milk.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.160]   Long before Remus had ended his story,
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.360]   Numitor knew that it was his grandson, his daughter,
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.600]   Sylvia's child, who stood before him
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.360]   and his old heart beat quick with joy.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.500]   Here at length was one who would take his side
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.120]   against the cruel King Aemulius.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.560]   At this moment, Romulus, leading a rough band of herdsmen,
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.360]   approached the city gate, determined to rescue his brother
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.560]   from the hands of Numitor.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.800]   In the city were many folk who groaned
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.240]   under the tyranny of Aemulius.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:30.240]   These, hearing that Romulus was without the city gate,
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.360]   stole noiselessly away to join the prince,
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.960]   believing he had come to punish the king.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.120]   Meanwhile, Romulus had divided his followers
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.520]   into companies of a hundred men.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.180]   At the head of each company was a captain
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:53.180]   carrying a small bundle of grass and shrubs tied to a pole.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:58.420]   These rough standards were called manipuli,
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.540]   and it was because they carried these manipuli
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.580]   that captains in the Roman army came to be called
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.420]   manipulares.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:12.720]   When Aemulius heard that Numitor had recognized
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.560]   in the prisoner one of his long-lost grandsons,
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.120]   he was afraid.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.860]   Then, hearing the shouts and blows of Romulus and his men
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.520]   as they attacked the city gate, he rushed to defend it,
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.520]   determined that the second prince should not enter the city.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.920]   But Romulus gained, captured the gate,
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.360]   slew the king, and entered the city in triumph.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.360]   Here he found Remus no longer a prisoner as he had feared,
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.680]   but the acknowledged grandson of Numitor.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.440]   The old king welcomed Romulus as joyfully
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.440]   as he had welcomed his brother,
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.080]   and the two princes, eager to please the gentle old man,
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.040]   placed him upon the throne
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.080]   from which he had so long ago been driven.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.000]   They then sped to the prison
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.120]   where their mother Sylvia had lain
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.880]   since the princes had been born.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.960]   Swiftly, they set her free
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.480]   and cheered her by their love and care
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.140]   as good sons ever will.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.080]   Did you enjoy that story?
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.520]   Were there words in the story that weren't familiar to you
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.560]   or words that you had heard before
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.520]   but used in a different way,
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:39.320]   such as the old man's eyes had fallen on the lad,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.800]   then he threw up his hands in amaze?
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.920]   We might say in amazement, okay?
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.040]   So go through the story again
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.320]   and see if there are words that are used differently
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.920]   from the ways that you're used to using them
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.840]   or words that you might need a little bit of explanation for
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.160]   in order to really understand the story.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.040]   But let's go on.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:07.080]   I want to read to you the next story in "Kings of Rome."
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.280]   It's called "The Sacred Birds."
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:17.320]   The grandsons of Numitor could no longer live as shepherds
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.880]   on Mount Palatine, which they had learned to love,
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.160]   nor could they dwell quietly in Alba for all their lives.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.120]   They'd been used to live free among the mountains,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.780]   nor had they been subject to any king.
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.240]   So the princes made up their minds to leave Alba
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.240]   and to build a city for themselves on the hills they loved.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.120]   But the brothers could not agree
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.600]   on which hill to build their city.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   Romulus choosing the Palatine, Remus the Aventine.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.120]   Not knowing how to settle their dispute,
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.520]   they asked Numitor to help them.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.520]   He bade them, as the custom was, to appeal to augury,
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:11.760]   that is, to watch for a sign or omen from the gods.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.400]   These signs were given in many different forms,
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:19.400]   sometimes by the flight of birds, as happened now.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.920]   The princes determined to follow their grandfather's advice.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   Romulus went to Mount Palatine, Remus to Mount Aventine,
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.520]   and patient through one long day, they watched for a sign.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.520]   But no sign appeared.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.720]   The slow hours passed and night drew on apace,
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   yet still the brothers never stirred.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.040]   Then, as darkness faded before the dawn,
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:53.040]   Remus saw far off, dark, moving shapes.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.840]   Were the gods going to be gracious, the prince wondered,
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.720]   and after so many hours send a sign?
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.480]   Nearer and nearer drew the dark shapes.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.960]   "Ah," cried Remus sharply, "it is a good omen."
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.160]   For now he could see that the moving forms
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.160]   were six vultures winging their way toward the west.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.520]   These birds were sacred to the gods
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.880]   and did no harm to corn, fruit, or cattle,
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   nor would they indeed wound any living thing.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.240]   Swiftly Remus bade a messenger to go tell his brother
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.120]   of the good omen vouchsafed to him.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.460]   But even as his messenger sped to do his will,
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.100]   Remus was crestfallen, for before him stood
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.240]   one of the servants of Romulus to tell him
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:50.080]   that his brother too had seen a flight of vultures.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:55.080]   But while Remus had seen six birds, Romulus had seen 12.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.400]   What was to be done?
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.040]   It seems now that the brothers were not thinking
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.120]   on which hill the city should stand,
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.920]   but of which of them should build the city.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.560]   Remus believed that the augury proclaimed him
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.920]   as the founder of the new city.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.680]   Romulus was sure that it was he
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.400]   who was intended by the gods to build it,
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.920]   for had he not seen 12 vultures
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.360]   while his brother had seen but six?
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.600]   The princes turned to their followers demanding
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.980]   who should be their king.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.840]   Then loud and lusty was the answering shout,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.440]   "Romulus, Romulus, he shall be our king!"
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:45.440]   And the next story is called The Founding of Rome.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.200]   It was in the year 753 BC that Romulus was chosen king.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.560]   He at once began to make preparations
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.480]   to build the city on the Palatine Hill,
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.020]   the foundation he wished to lay on the 21st
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.520]   of the glad month of April, for, as Romulus knew,
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.000]   this was a feast day among the shepherds.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.680]   Often he, with his brother, had joined the herdsmen
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.600]   on that day to offer cakes to the goddess Peles,
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.360]   to beseech her blessing on themselves and on their flocks.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.140]   And when the prayers and sacrifices were over,
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.920]   how gladly he had joined in the shepherds' games and jollity,
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.120]   no better day could be found on which
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.000]   to lay the foundation of the new city.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.960]   When the feast day arrived, a hole was first dug
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.520]   on the spot where the city was to stand,
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.360]   and to this hole the king flung the first fruits
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.880]   of the earth, corn and fruit.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.100]   Each of his followers then took a handful of earth,
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.820]   which he had carried with him from his own,
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:03.360]   perhaps distant home, and flung it also into the hole,
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.600]   which was then filled to the top.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.480]   Here, too, an altar was built on which the people
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.720]   laid offerings to the gods, from henceforth the spot
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.920]   where the temple had been erected
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.080]   was to be the hearth or center of the new city.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.760]   Romulus, then throwing his toga, or we would say his mantle,
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.840]   around him with one end covering his head,
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.840]   took a white bull and a cow and yoked them to a sacred plow,
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:38.220]   the share, or cutting blade, which was made of brass.
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.000]   With this plow share, the king then made a furrow
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.840]   to mark the boundary of the city,
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.520]   bidding his followers watch that the upturned earth
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.600]   fell inward to the hearth of the city.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.600]   Not a clod must be allowed to lie without the furrow.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.480]   When the plow reached the different spots
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.320]   at which the gates of the city were to stand,
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.640]   it was carefully lifted over the spaces.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.920]   As he guided the plow, Romulus cried to his gods
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.440]   that his city might become strong and endure
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.760]   and ever grow more powerful in the great world.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.640]   Out of a clear sky, thunder crashed,
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.400]   lightning flashed over the hills
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.200]   as Romulus uttered his petitions,
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.600]   and the people believed that the storm
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.840]   was the answer of the god Jupiter
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.260]   to the prayers of their king.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.720]   When these sacred rites were ended,
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.560]   Romulus bade his men begin at once
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   to build the wall, which was to surround his city.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.040]   The wall itself was sacred.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.400]   None might enter the city save by the gates,
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.520]   so the king bade one of his followers, named Celer,
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.760]   to guard the sacred furrow and to see that no one dared
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.760]   to scale the wall or jump across it as it was being built.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.800]   Remus, who was still angry that he had not been chosen king,
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   had been standing near to Romulus
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.040]   as he laid the foundation of the city.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.120]   Then, as the wall began to rise before him,
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.760]   a swift rage sprang up in his heart,
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.080]   and he leaped across it, saying,
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.080]   "Shall such defenses as these guard your city?"
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.140]   Celer, the watchman, seeing that Remus
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.940]   had scorned the order of the king,
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.220]   raised his spade in sudden fury
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.860]   and struck the young prince dead to the ground.
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:51.460]   Then, fearing lest Romulus should punish him
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.640]   for his hasty deed, he fled.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.020]   Fear lent him wings, and his name from that day
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:03.540]   became a byword to betoken great speed,
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:08.060]   our own word, celerity, comes from Celer,
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.460]   the swift-footed servant of Romulus.
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.980]   When Romulus was told that his brother had been slain,
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.360]   he showed neither grief nor anger.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:26.220]   "Thus perish everyone who may attempt to cross these walls,"
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:32.900]   were his stern words to those who brought the sad tidings.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:37.900]   Celer, it was plain, had fled in needless haste.
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:46.460]   Okay, you guys, let's think about some questions
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.900]   that we might ask to get conversation going
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.020]   from these three stories.
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.500]   Go back to the first story,
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.360]   Numitor recognizes his grandsons.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.360]   And it says in there that Numitor looked at this prisoner
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.800]   who everybody thought was a shepherd
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.520]   and saw something different in him.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.520]   How does someone bear himself as a prince?
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.240]   You might have to talk with your children
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.840]   about what that means.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.560]   What is your bearing?
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.340]   It's the way you stand, the way you present yourself,
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.700]   the way you hold yourself, hold your head,
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.520]   the pride that you show in yourself.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.680]   How does someone bear himself as a prince?
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.900]   Have your kids demonstrate for you, all right?
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:48.880]   So in this same story,
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:54.220]   when Remus was the prisoner
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.920]   who had been brought before Numitor,
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.720]   Romulus, his twin brother, was outside
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.960]   and he was eager to save his brother.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.220]   And so he fashioned a weapon.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.120]   So he's outside and he's gonna storm the city gates
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.500]   and he's gonna come in and save his brother.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.760]   So he fashioned a weapon.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.960]   Do you remember what the weapon was and what it looked like?
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.800]   What in the world?
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.280]   It sounded like a weird kind of weapon to me.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.100]   What good would that weapon do?
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.620]   And would you make a weapon like that?
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.840]   Ask your kids.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.200]   If you were gonna rescue your brother or your sister
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.720]   or your mom and dad from an enemy,
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.320]   what kind of weapon would you use?
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.320]   If you had to make the weapon for what you have around you,
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.640]   maybe in your yard or in your garage
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.720]   or even in your bedroom,
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.920]   what kind of weapon would you use, okay?
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.900]   So in this story, Numitor recognizes his grandsons.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.900]   It talks about gentleness winning the day.
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.180]   What does that mean?
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.520]   And how did gentleness win the day?
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:13.560]   Can you think of a time when kindness
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.200]   made a tough situation easier?
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.120]   Now remember, once Romulus and Remus had been discovered
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:26.620]   to be the grandsons of the old king,
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.080]   they couldn't live as shepherds anymore.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.160]   That would just be weird.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.120]   But they really didn't wanna live in the city
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.480]   like princes might do because they were used to being free
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.560]   and living out in the wild.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:44.480]   How might living in a city
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.480]   and living in a country be different, okay?
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.320]   Which do you know the best?
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.800]   Are you used to living in the country
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.760]   or are you used to living in the city?
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.720]   And would you like to try the other?
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.260]   You might have your kids make a diorama
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.400]   of what life in the country is like
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.040]   and one, what life in the city is like,
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.340]   or they could make a poster and they could act it out.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.120]   You guys could have a great conversation
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.500]   about what it means to live in the country.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:25.500]   And there are lots of other city-country comparison stories
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:30.020]   for you to explore.
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:33.760]   That's a great conversation starter.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.740]   And maybe mom, dad, if you lived in the city
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:41.440]   when you were a child but live in the country now
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.800]   or vice versa, you could share from your own experiences
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.260]   what that would be like.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.420]   Now, you know that things did not stay happy
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.860]   with Romulus and Remus.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.060]   And when it came to the founding of Rome,
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.340]   only one of them could be king.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.080]   And so Romulus and Remus,
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.220]   they didn't get along as well as grownups.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:11.220]   What do you do when you have a dispute with somebody,
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:16.380]   when you're fussing or fighting or disagreeing with someone?
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:22.300]   Kids, who helps you handle your disagreements with others?
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:28.860]   How do you learn to handle your own disagreements?
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.500]   Mom, dad, this is a great teachable moment
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:38.500]   to talk about learning to handle our own disputes.
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.540]   All right?
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:43.820]   In this story also, in these stories,
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:48.820]   we also hear about augury, augury, an appeal to augury.
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:54.260]   And Numitor tells Romulus and Remus,
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.140]   well, he doesn't know where they should build
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.140]   their new city.
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:03.140]   And so an appeal to augury, a sign or omen from the gods.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:08.540]   Now, we do not appeal to the gods
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:13.540]   when we want advice or guidance with a problem or a concern.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.620]   We appeal to our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.460]   We appeal to God, our Father.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:24.740]   How do we ask God to guide us?
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.860]   How do we ask God to guide us?
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.700]   We don't ask for an omen,
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.500]   but there were times in the Bible
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.740]   when God's people asked him for a sign
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.700]   of what they should do.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.900]   How do we ask God to guide us?
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.860]   Talk about with your family,
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:47.860]   how God has guided you or your family in the past.
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:54.380]   Kids, ask your parents to tell you about a time
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:59.500]   that God guided them when they had a decision to make.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:04.540]   Also in these stories,
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:09.540]   we see what happens when jealousy comes into play.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.580]   When jealousy rears its head.
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:17.580]   How did jealousy divide Romulus and Remus in the story?
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:25.780]   How does jealousy divide friends and family today?
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:30.700]   How maybe has jealousy ever divided you from a friend
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.180]   or from a brother or sister?
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:37.100]   What causes jealousy?
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.620]   What does the Bible teach us about jealousy?
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:47.900]   What should we do to root out jealousy
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:54.900]   before it becomes a bitter root in our heart
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.980]   causing lots of problems?
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.780]   These are some great questions
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.220]   that you can ask your children
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.960]   that you guys can use together
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.740]   to explore the stories that we read more fully,
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:12.640]   more deeply and to draw your hearts closer together.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:17.640]   Reading together is a way for a family to build community
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.340]   and to learn one another's hearts.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.260]   And I hope that you guys will enjoy
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.160]   doing that very thing this summer.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.760]   See you next time.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.920]   (gentle music)
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.980]   you
