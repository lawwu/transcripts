[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   All right, so I want to try something somewhat new here.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.360]   We're trying to do more case studies on this show.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.160]   This is the feedback we got that people would like to hear more details about real people's
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.020]   experiences putting these ideas into practice.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.640]   As I've mentioned, the medium term goal is a call.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.560]   We want to have people call in live and actually interact with me.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.600]   That's all complicated.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.600]   Sound is complicated.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.560]   Don't even get me started on that, but we're working on it.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.120]   In the meantime, I'm also soliciting you can send in text case studies in the same question
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.200]   survey that you can use to submit your questions.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.160]   That link is in the show notes, but I wanted to read one today from Josh.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.440]   He was a network engineer who's in his 20s.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.400]   All right, so here's what Josh had to say, and I'll just read this.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.200]   A world without email got my team and me through a crisis.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.800]   I got a copy of it on pre-order, and just after it arrived, my wife and I went on vacation
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   to Puerto Rico.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.200]   It was really lovely being able to just read about a better way to work while sitting on
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.200]   the beach.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.760]   I'm returning home from vacation.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.280]   My IT team suffered an unexpected crisis, and I was thrown into a demanding management
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.280]   role.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.240]   I'm the kind of person who likes to feel in control, and the one mission I could give
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.920]   myself to preserve some semblance of that feeling was to make sure that we didn't drop
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.220]   a single ball in response to this crisis.
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.920]   As a team, we had minimal shared documentation, and we had no central work repository, so
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.040]   I didn't even know what engineering work was happening.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.000]   My first thought was to collect all work items into a task board, just like a world without
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.180]   email lays out, but I didn't have the time to wait for corporate procurement to approve
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.320]   an enterprise Trello subscription, and we didn't have a way to get the team onto any
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.320]   sort of task board.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.920]   So we ended up creating a minimum viable product out of folders on a shared drive.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.160]   We had a folder called active work.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.000]   Inside of that folder, we had a new folder for each work item.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.140]   The folder name was a short description of the task itself.
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.760]   Inside that folder was a notes.txt file that detailed the task.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.880]   Any emails pertaining to the task were copied and pasted into an emails.txt file.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.080]   Any working documents were also saved in that folder.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.720]   So for example, we might have a folder named design data center core that would contain
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.120]   a notes.txt file detailing all the design considerations and a working diagram and a
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.660]   spreadsheet also in that folder.
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.200]   If I were to take ownership of a task, I would modify the folder name to indicate that.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.480]   So now it might say, Josh colon design data center core.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.080]   That way, an alphabetical sort of the active work folder would isolate all of my work.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.240]   As I finished a task, I would update the notes.txt file with closeout notes and change the folder
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.080]   name to completed colon Josh colon design data center core.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.280]   We could focus exclusively on a task by opening that folder.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.720]   We could share notes and feedback between team members by dropping a txt file in that
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.760]   folder.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.840]   We could see work in progress at a glance.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.000]   We had a way to gather detailed information about a task without actually having to own
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.480]   the task and start working on it.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.660]   We only use that system for a couple of months, but it accomplished its goal.
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.120]   We didn't drop or forget even a single task.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.560]   There were no external teams that might have company that felt like they needed to escalate
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.200]   issues to my manager.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.600]   We were able to share the increased workload to the team, even though I was primarily the
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.480]   one collecting information about work items.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.120]   From there, we were able to move to a real task board.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.240]   And 18 months later, our little team is now seen as an agile transformation leader within
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.640]   our broader organization.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.400]   All right, it's a cool case study because two reasons.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.840]   One, it highlights something I say often on this show, which is when it comes to organizing
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.320]   work, especially in teams, start with the process first, what makes the most sense for
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.800]   us to organize our work and then to figure out what tools you need to implement that.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.240]   And that is exactly what Josh did in that story, because they couldn't procure the right
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.240]   tools fast enough.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.240]   They said we can just use text files and folder names.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.040]   And it worked great.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.260]   What mattered was the process.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.040]   And then once they got approval to switch to a task, or they switched to a task board,
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.360]   but it was that process that they switched to a task board.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.680]   And it didn't really matter if they were implementing it by changing the name of folders, or if
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.520]   they're on a Trello board, it was the same process.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.880]   And so I think that's really cool to see.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.560]   And then two, I just like that specific setup.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.160]   That's a cool system.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.560]   Right?
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.400]   Folders for each thing that we're actively working on all of the information relevant
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.300]   to that thing, go into that folder, including relevant emails, have a key readme file in
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.240]   each folder that gives you the overview of exactly where everything lands, put your name
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.440]   into the directory title.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.440]   So we know who's working on what that's a great system.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.680]   And see what Josh said there.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.840]   Josh said, all of the incoming was directed at him.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.360]   So it's this was a, the elaboration explained as a IT team within a big organization.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.880]   So IT teams get hammered with build us this fix this, add this new feature, implement
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.120]   this system.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.520]   It's all day long.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.760]   It all came to Josh.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.320]   And yet he said, he felt like all this work was very intelligently distributed to the
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.560]   whole team.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.200]   Everyone was working on different things, beautiful collaboration.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.160]   And because they built a process here that made sense.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.600]   So anyways, great example, Josh, I appreciate, appreciate that those specifics.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.960]   And I appreciate that opportunity to talk about when you get specific about workflows,
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.880]   as opposed to just saying, Look, we're all on Slack, let's rock and roll, things can
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.880]   get a lot better.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.600]   I like how he says when he does the alphabetical search, it can just show all his work right
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600]   there.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.520]   So there's definitely an IT labor to that system.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.000]   Yeah, well, if you put your name in the folder, and you can alphabet alphabetized folders,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.880]   alphabetized folders, it is true, like existing technology is great.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.480]   Yeah, it's not the problem.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.800]   The problem is not that someone hasn't built a fancy web interface for what you're trying
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   to do.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.480]   The problem is you don't have a system that you're just on email, like, did you get my
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   last message?
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.480]   Why don't you respond?
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.960]   So good for you, Josh.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:43.940]   [MUSIC]
