[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.940]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.780]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.180]   Today, we're going to talk about the neuroscience of fear.
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.460]   We are also going to talk about trauma
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.380]   and post-traumatic stress disorders.
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.060]   The neuroscience of fear has a long history in biology
[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.540]   and in the field of psychology.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.420]   However, I think it's fair to say that in the last 10 years,
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.220]   the field of neuroscience has shed light
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.420]   on not just the neural circuits,
[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.540]   meaning the areas of the brain
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.060]   that control the fear response and the ways that it does it,
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.060]   but some important ways to extinguish fears
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.780]   using behavioral therapies, drug therapies,
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.300]   and what we call brain-machine interfaces.
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.660]   Today, we are going to talk about all of those,
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.140]   and you are going to come away
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.900]   with both an understanding of the biology of fear and trauma
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.380]   as well as many practical tools to confront fear and trauma.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.820]   In fact, we are going to discuss
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.420]   one very recently published study
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.420]   in which five minutes a day of deliberate exposure to stress
[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.980]   was shown to alleviate long-standing depressive
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.940]   and fear-related symptoms.
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.780]   We will get into the details of that study
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.100]   and the protocol that emerges from that study
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.920]   a little later in the podcast,
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.960]   but it stands as a really important,
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.320]   somewhat counterintuitive example
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.420]   of how stress itself can be used to combat fear.
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.520]   To give you a sense of where we are going,
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.160]   I'll just lay out the framework for today's podcast.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.620]   First, I'm going to teach you
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.300]   about the biology of fear and trauma,
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.340]   literally the cells and circuits
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.420]   and connections in the body and chemicals in the body
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.340]   that give rise to the so-called fear response
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.020]   and why sometimes, but not always,
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.360]   fear can turn into trauma.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.240]   I will also describe the biology of how fear is unlearned
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.080]   or what we call extinguished.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.680]   And there too, you're going to get some serious surprises.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.920]   You're going to learn, for instance,
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800]   that we can't just eliminate fears,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.660]   we actually have to replace fears with a new positive event.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.980]   And again, there are tools with which to do that,
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.940]   and I will teach you those tools today.
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.640]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.580]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.500]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.100]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.820]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.860]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.620]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.880]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.500]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.900]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.140]   I've been taking Athletic Greens every day since 2012,
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.540]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.340]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.280]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.340]   is that it covers all of my vitamin mineral
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.100]   and probiotic needs.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.180]   Nowadays, there's a lot of data out there
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.860]   pointing to the fact that a healthy gut microbiome,
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.900]   literally little microbes that live in our gut
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.980]   that are good for us,
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.280]   is important to support our immune system,
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.260]   our nervous system, our endocrine system,
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.560]   and various aspects of our immediate and long-term health.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.400]   With Athletic Greens,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.420]   I get all the vitamins and minerals that I need,
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.160]   plus the probiotics ensure a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.260]   It also tastes really good.
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.540]   I mix mine up with some water, a little bit of lemon juice.
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.860]   I'll have that early in the day
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.340]   and sometimes a second time later in the day as well.
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.220]   It's compatible with intermittent fasting.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.580]   It's compatible with vegan diets, with keto diets,
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.740]   and essentially every diet
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.480]   that you could possibly imagine out there.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.800]   It's also filled with adaptogens for recovery.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.660]   It has digestive enzymes for gut health
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.740]   and it has a number of other things
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.300]   that support the immune system.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.520]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.060]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.580]   to claim their special offer.
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.080]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.960]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.060]   while you're on the road,
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.580]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.420]   There's now a lot of evidence that vitamin D3
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.140]   supports a huge number of metabolic factors,
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.260]   immune system factors, endocrine factors.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.980]   Basically, we need vitamin D3.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.320]   We can get it from the sun,
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.820]   but many people are deficient in vitamin D3
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.020]   even if they are getting
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.940]   what they think is sufficient sunlight.
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.340]   And K2 is important for cardiovascular health.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.240]   So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.780]   you can claim their special offer,
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.940]   the five free travel packs
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.780]   plus the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.980]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.480]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.900]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.440]   to help you better understand your body
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.340]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.280]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.860]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.180]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.740]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.220]   And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.820]   you can also get information about how your specific genes
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.360]   are impacting your immediate and long-term health.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.860]   Now, a problem with a lot of blood tests
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.340]   and DNA tests out there is you get the numbers back,
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.340]   but you don't know what to do with those numbers.
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.020]   With Inside Tracker, they make it very simple
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.260]   to figure out what to do to bring those numbers
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.180]   into the ranges that are right for you.
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.940]   They have a dashboard that's very easy to use.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.420]   You can see the numbers from your blood and or DNA tests,
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.060]   and it will point to specific lifestyle factors,
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.900]   nutritional factors, as well as supplementation,
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.540]   maybe even prescription factors that would be right for you
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.580]   to bring the numbers into range that are ideal
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.980]   for your immediate and long-term health goals.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.660]   Another feature that Inside Tracker has
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.540]   is their inner age test.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.820]   This test shows you what your biological age is
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.140]   and compares that to your chronological age
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.840]   and what you can do to improve your biological age,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.740]   which of course is the important number.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.100]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.720]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.540]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.180]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.680]   I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.100]   for close to a year now,
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.180]   and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.000]   Helix has a quiz that takes about two minutes to complete
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.760]   and matches your body type and sleep preferences
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.580]   to the perfect mattress for you.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.780]   Some people sleep on their side,
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.860]   some people sleep on their back,
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.180]   some people sleep on their stomach,
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.140]   some people run hot, some people run cold,
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.180]   some people don't know which part of their body
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.380]   they sleep on.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.780]   You take this test, it's very brief, two minutes,
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.000]   and after that test, Helix will match you to the mattress
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.160]   that's ideal for you.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.000]   I matched to the so-called DUSK mattress
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.160]   because I wanted a mattress that wasn't too firm,
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.220]   not too soft, and I like to sleep sort of on my stomach
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.460]   in kind of a crawling soldier position.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.620]   That seems to be always how I wake up
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.920]   in the morning anyway.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.660]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.980]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.260]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.020]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress,
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.420]   and you'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders,
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.240]   and you'll get two free pillows.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.940]   Again, if you're interested, please go to helixsleep.com,
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.740]   slash Huberman for up to $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.640]   So what is fear?
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.960]   Well, fear falls into a category of nervous system phenomenon
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.620]   that we can reliably call an emotion,
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.980]   and it is hotly debated nowadays,
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.500]   and it's been hotly debated really for centuries
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.780]   what an emotion is and what an emotion isn't.
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.100]   Now, that's not a debate that I want to get into today.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.160]   I think it's fair to say that emotions include responses
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.680]   within our body, quickening of heart rate,
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.260]   changes in blood flow,
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.020]   things that we experience as a warming
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.540]   or a cooling of our skin,
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.860]   but that there's also a cognitive component.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.020]   There are thoughts, there are memories,
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.260]   there's all sorts of stuff that goes on in our mind
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.820]   and in our body that together we call an emotion.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.180]   And there's a vast amount of interest and literature devoted
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.740]   to trying to understand how many different emotions there
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.380]   are, how different people experience emotions.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.940]   And that's certainly a topic that we will embrace
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.840]   in a future podcast episode.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.040]   But today I just want to talk about fear as a response,
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.740]   because when we talk about fear as a physiological response
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.720]   and as a cognitive response,
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.880]   then we can get down to some very concrete mechanisms
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.060]   and some very concrete and practical tools
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.780]   that can be used to deal with fear when fear is not wanted.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.800]   So let's talk first about what fear isn't.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.780]   Most people are familiar with stress,
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.900]   both as a concept and as an experience.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.500]   Stress is a physiological response.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.360]   It involves quickening of the heart rate,
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.680]   typically quickening of breathing,
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.540]   blood flow getting shuttled to certain areas
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.800]   of the brain and body and not to others.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.100]   It can create a hypervigilance or an awareness.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.300]   Typically that awareness is narrower,
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.140]   literally narrower in space like a soda straw view
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.260]   of the world than when we are relaxed.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.700]   And it is fair to say that we cannot have fear
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.540]   without having several, if not all of the elements
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.100]   of the stress response.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.180]   However, we can have stress without having fear.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.220]   Likewise, people are familiar with the phrase
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.460]   or the word rather anxiety.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.640]   Anxiety tends to be stress about some future event,
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.500]   although it can mean other things as well.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.440]   We can't really have fear without seeing or observing
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.340]   or experiencing some of the elements of anxiety,
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.140]   but we can have anxiety without having fear.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.260]   So what you're starting to realize is that fear is built up
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.540]   from certain basic elements that include stress and anxiety.
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.660]   And then there is trauma.
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.340]   And trauma also requires a specific,
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.060]   what we will call operational definition.
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.140]   And an operational definition is just a definition
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.800]   that allows us to have a conversation
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.000]   because we both agree on or mostly agree on
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.140]   what the meaning of a given word is.
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.780]   It makes conversations much easier.
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.100]   In fact, I would argue if we all had operational definitions
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.520]   for more things in the world,
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.080]   that there would be fewer misunderstandings and arguments
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.360]   and we'd all move a lot further as a species.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.840]   But that's another topic entirely.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.840]   The operational definition of trauma is that some fear
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.520]   took place, which of course includes stress and anxiety.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.800]   And that fear somehow gets embedded or activated
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.040]   in our nervous system such that it shows up
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.120]   at times when it's maladaptive,
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.080]   meaning that fear doesn't serve us well
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.940]   and it gets reactivated at various times.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.000]   Like when you first wake up in the morning,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.120]   if you're not in the presence of something that scared you,
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.820]   but you suddenly have what feels like a panic attack
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.260]   and you're in deep fear,
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.940]   well, that's post-traumatic stress,
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.000]   that's post-traumatic fear.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.740]   So I don't want to get bogged down too much
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.940]   in the nomenclature,
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.000]   but what I'm doing here is building up
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.340]   a sort of a series of layers where stress and anxiety
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.400]   form the foundation of what we're calling fear and trauma.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.840]   And then there are other phrases out there
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.720]   that we would be remiss if we didn't mention
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.180]   things like phobias and panic attacks.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.940]   Panic attacks are the experience of extreme fear,
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.040]   but without any fear inducing stimulus.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.780]   So it's kind of like trauma and a phobia
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.640]   tends to be extreme fear of something specific,
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.360]   fear of spiders, fear of heights, fear of flying,
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.640]   fear of dying, these kinds of things, okay?
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.980]   The reason for laying all that out there
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.160]   is not to create a word soup to confuse us,
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.980]   rather it is to simplify the issue
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.800]   because now that we acknowledge
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.320]   that there are many different phrases to describe this thing
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.000]   that we call fear and in related phenomenon,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.960]   we can start to just focus on two of these issues,
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.560]   fear and trauma,
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.720]   as it relates to specific biological processes,
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.840]   specific cognitive processes,
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.120]   and we can start to dissect how fears are formed,
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.840]   how fears are unformed and how new memories
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.920]   can come to replace previously fearful experiences.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.100]   So in this effort to establish a common language
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.960]   around fear and trauma,
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.120]   I want to point out autonomic arousal.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.540]   Autonomic arousal relates to this aspect
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.880]   of our nervous system that we call
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.120]   the autonomic nervous system.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.080]   Autonomic means automatic.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.260]   That's somewhat of a misnomer
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.520]   because there are aspects of your autonomic nervous system
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.840]   that you can control,
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.000]   but your autonomic nervous system controls things
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   like digestion, urination, sexual behavior, stress.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.800]   When you want to be awake, when you want to be asleep,
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.200]   it basically has two branches to it,
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   two branches meaning two different systems.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.400]   One is the so-called sympathetic autonomic nervous system,
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.800]   has nothing to do with sympathy,
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.440]   has everything to do with increasing alertness.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.460]   Think of the sympathetic nervous system
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.000]   as the alertness nervous system.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.420]   It's what ramps up your levels of alertness,
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.940]   ramps up your levels of vigilance.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.880]   Think about it as the accelerator
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.640]   on your alertness and attention.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.060]   The other branch of the autonomic nervous system
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.220]   is the so-called parasympathetic branch
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.460]   of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.020]   I know that's a mouthful.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.800]   The parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.960]   are the cells and neurons and chemicals
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.120]   and other aspects of your brain and body
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.280]   that are involved in the calming nervous system.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.560]   So sympathetic is alerting, parasympathetic is calming,
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.440]   and it acts as sort of a seesaw
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.600]   to adjust your overall level of alertness.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.600]   So for instance, right now I'm alert,
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.120]   but I feel pretty calm.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.880]   I'm not ready to go to sleep or anything like that.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.160]   I don't feel like I need a nap.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.720]   I'm alert, but I'm calm.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.560]   I'm not in a state of stress or panic.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.840]   So that seesaw we could imagine is more or less level.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.360]   Maybe it's tilted up a little bit to the side
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.560]   of increased sympathetic or alertness
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.360]   rather than parasympathetic because I feel wide awake.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.160]   If I were sleepy, the opposite would be true.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.500]   The parasympathetic side would be increased
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.200]   relative to the sympathetic side.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.480]   There are many different aspects
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.700]   to the autonomic nervous system,
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.720]   but one of the main aspects is an aspect
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.120]   that's going to come up again and again and again today.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.000]   It's very important that you understand what it is.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.640]   It's called the HPA axis.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.640]   The HPA axis stands for hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.060]   The hypothalamus is a collection of neurons.
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.440]   It's an area of your brain, real estate,
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.700]   that's deep in the brain at the base of the brain
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.120]   that contains many, many different areas
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.560]   that control things like temperature and desire to have sex,
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.400]   desire to eat, thirst.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.760]   It also controls the desire to not mate, have sex,
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.280]   not eat, not drink more water
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.280]   or any other type of fluid.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.820]   So it has accelerators and breaks in there as well.
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.720]   The hypothalamus connects to the so-called pituitary.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.500]   The pituitary lives close to the roof of your mouth.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.360]   It releases hormones into your bloodstream.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.020]   And so the hypothalamus has this ability
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.800]   to trigger the release or prevent the release
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.920]   of particular hormones like cortisol
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.080]   or the hormones that go stimulate ovaries
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.080]   to produce estrogen or testes to produce testosterone
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.180]   or adrenals to produce adrenaline.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.480]   And speaking of the adrenals,
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.400]   that A and the HPA are the adrenals.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.800]   You have two glands that sit above your kidneys
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.000]   in your lower back.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.520]   They receive signals by way of nerve cells, neurons,
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.360]   and by way of hormones and other things
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.600]   released from the brain and elsewhere in the body.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.940]   And they release different hormones
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.640]   and other types of chemicals into the body.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.960]   And the two main ones that you need to know about today
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.960]   are adrenaline, also called epinephrine, and cortisol.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.160]   Both of those are so-called stress hormones,
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.220]   but they're not always involved in stress.
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.520]   They're also involved in waking up in the morning
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.380]   when you arrive, when you, excuse me,
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.680]   when you rise from sleep.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.000]   And so this HPA axis should be thought of
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.080]   in the following way.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.080]   The HPA axis includes a piece of the brain,
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.400]   the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the adrenal.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.920]   So it's a beautiful three-part system
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.400]   that can use your brain to alert or wake up your body
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.220]   and prepare it for action.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.420]   And it can do that in the short term
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.880]   by triggering the release of hormones and chemicals
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.240]   that make you alert and ready to go right away.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.200]   And by triggering the release of neurotransmitters
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.720]   and hormones and other chemicals
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.320]   that give that alertness a very long tail,
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.640]   a very long latency before it shuts off.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.200]   And that's important because one of the hallmarks of fear
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.520]   and one of the hallmarks of trauma
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.840]   is that they involve fear responses that are long lasting.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.320]   Even if those fearful events,
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.760]   the events in the world that trigger the HPA axis
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.660]   can be very brief,
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.880]   like a car that almost hits you as you step off the curb
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.040]   or something, a gunshot that goes off suddenly,
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.280]   and it's just a very quick,
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.580]   like 500 millisecond or one second event,
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.380]   the fear response can reverberate through your system
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.260]   because the chemicals that are involved in this HPA axis
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:44.360]   have a fast component and a longer lasting component.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.600]   And the longer lasting component can actually change
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.560]   not just the connections of different areas of the brain
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.040]   and the way that our organs work,
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.080]   like our heart and the way that we breathe,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.680]   it actually can feed back to the brain
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.400]   and literally control gene expression,
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.520]   which can take many days and build out new circuits
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.960]   and new chemicals that can embed fear in our brain and body.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.760]   And that might sound very depressing,
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.940]   but there's a reason and there's an adaptive reason
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.180]   why there's this slow and fast phase of the HPA axis
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.840]   and the fear response.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.240]   And fortunately, that gene expression
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.480]   and the long arc of the fear response,
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.160]   the way it kind of lives in our system,
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.360]   kind of like a phantom in some ways,
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.560]   can also be leveraged to undo the fear response,
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.080]   to extinguish the fear response
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.340]   and replace it with non-fearful associations.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.740]   So let's dig a little deeper into the neural circuits
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.740]   and biology of fear.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.140]   Because in doing that, we can start to reveal the logic
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.620]   of how to attack fear if that's the goal.
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.540]   We can't really have a discussion about fear
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.940]   without discussing the famous amygdala.
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.100]   Famous because I think most people by now
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.980]   have heard of the amygdala.
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.660]   Amygdala means almond.
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.960]   It's an almond-shaped structure on both sides of the brain.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.240]   So you have one on the right side of your brain
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.020]   and one on the left side of your brain.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.820]   The amygdala is part of what we can call the threat reflex.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.920]   And this is very important to conceptualize fear
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.140]   as including a reflex.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.100]   So much as you have reflexes that cause you
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.380]   to lift your foot up if you are to step on something sharp,
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.920]   you literally have a reflex within your spinal cord
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.900]   that causes you to lift up one foot
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.700]   and extend the other one toward the ground.
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.580]   Believe it or not, you always think
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.700]   you step on something sharp, you pull your foot up,
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.560]   but you actually step on something sharp,
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.340]   you pull your foot up and in pulling it up,
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.300]   there's another reflex that's activated
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.060]   that as you extend your other leg
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.980]   so that you don't fall over.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.120]   Similarly, in the process of experiencing fear,
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.340]   you have a reflex for particular events
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.580]   in your brain and body.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.500]   And that reflex involves things
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.380]   like quickening of your heart rate, hypervigilance,
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.000]   your attentional systems pop on,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.180]   increased ability to access energy stores
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.060]   for movement and thought and so forth.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.380]   But just like that step on the tack reflex example,
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.540]   all of the neural circuits that are associated
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.820]   with being calm, with being able to go to sleep,
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.880]   with being able to visualize the full picture
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.420]   of your environment, literally,
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.960]   to see your entire environment
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.480]   or to hear other things around you,
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.100]   all of those get shut down
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.580]   when the so-called threat reflex gets activated.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.620]   And the amygdala is part of the threat reflex,
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.340]   so much so that we can really say
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.740]   that it's the final common pathway
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.380]   through which the threat reflex flows.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.980]   In other words, the amygdala is essential
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.020]   for the threat response.
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.640]   But the threat reflex and the threat response
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.140]   is kind of a dumb response.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.620]   It's not a sophisticated thing.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:48.980]   It's very generic.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.580]   And this is also a very important point.
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.740]   One of the beauties of the fear system
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.620]   is that it's very generalizable.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.300]   It's not designed for you to be afraid of any one thing.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.340]   Sure, there are some debates
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.520]   and probably some good data out there
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.780]   that support the fact that human babies are innately,
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.160]   meaning it requires no learning,
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.940]   innately afraid of certain things
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.300]   like heights or snakes or spiders.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.420]   There's debate about this,
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.380]   and it depends on the quality of the experiment, et cetera.
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.260]   But the real capacity of the fear system
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.580]   is that we can become afraid of anything
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.500]   provided that this threat system is activated
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.540]   in conjunction with some external experience.
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.920]   So the way I'd like you to think about the amygdala
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.420]   is not as a fear center,
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.700]   but that it's a critical component of the threat reflex.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.760]   I'd like you to also internalize the idea
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.620]   that the threat reflex involves
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.380]   this activation of certain systems
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.420]   and suppression of all the systems for calming,
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.340]   the parasympathetic system.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.020]   And now I'm going to describe the way
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:55.020]   that information flows into and through this threat reflex.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.260]   And in doing that, it will reveal how specific things
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.860]   like a spider, like a snake, like a physical trauma,
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.880]   like a car accident, like a fear of public speaking,
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.060]   whatever happens to scare you or scare somebody,
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.740]   how that gets attached to this reflex,
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.140]   because this reflex is very generic.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.180]   It doesn't really know what to be afraid of.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.480]   It only knows how to create the sensation,
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.820]   this internal landscape that we think of as fear.
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.940]   So while the amygdala might look like an almond,
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.420]   it's actually part of a much bigger complex
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.700]   or collection of neurons called the amygdaloid complex.
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.740]   That complex has anywhere from 12 to 14 areas,
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.740]   depending on which neuroanatomist is naming things
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.020]   and carving it up.
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.480]   In neuroscience and in much of biology,
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.960]   we like to joke that there are lumpers
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.960]   and there are splitters.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.520]   So some people like to draw boundaries
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.840]   between every little distinct difference and say,
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.940]   oh, that's a separate area and other people are lumpers.
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.180]   And they say, well, listen, why complicate things?
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.520]   Let's lump those together.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.060]   I'm neither a lumper nor a splitter.
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.460]   I'm somewhere in between.
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.380]   I think the number 12 is a good number
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.840]   in terms of the number of different areas of the amygdala.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.320]   Why is that important to us?
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.460]   Well, it turns out that the amygdala
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.720]   is not just a area for threat.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.460]   It's an area for generating threat reflexes
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.760]   that integrates lots of different types of information.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.920]   So for those of you that want to know,
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.980]   I'm going to give you some names, some nomenclature.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.740]   For those of you that don't, you can tune out for this,
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.400]   but basically information from our memory systems,
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.460]   like the hippocampus and from our sensory systems,
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.980]   our eyes, our ears, our nose, our mouth, et cetera.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.260]   So taste information, vision, auditory information,
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.880]   touch, et cetera, flow into the so-called lateral portion
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.080]   of the amygdala or the amygdala complex.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.660]   It flows into the lateral portion
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.180]   and then there are multiple outputs from the amygdala.
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.680]   And this is where things get particularly interesting
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.640]   because the outputs of the amygdala
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.680]   have a lot of different areas,
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.340]   but there are two main pathways.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.800]   One involves the hypothalamus,
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.680]   which you heard about before this collection of neurons
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.140]   that control a lot of our primitive drives for sex,
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.140]   for food, for thirst, and for warmth, et cetera.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.560]   And it also feeds out to our adrenals,
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.960]   those glands that you learned about a few minutes ago
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.360]   to create a sense of alertness and action.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.760]   It also feeds out, what I mean by feeds out, by the way,
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.920]   is there are neurons that send wires,
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.160]   we call those wires axons connections,
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.480]   where they can release chemicals
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.300]   and trigger the activation of different brain areas.
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.020]   So it feeds out to other brain areas such as the PAG.
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.000]   PAG is very interesting for our discussion today.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.880]   It's the periaqueductal gray.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.340]   The periaqueductal gray contains neurons
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.580]   that can trigger freezing, can trigger the,
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.920]   some people talk about the fawning response,
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.600]   which is kind of an appeasing response to traumatic events,
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.720]   but some people outright freeze in response to fear, right?
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.560]   We've heard of fight or flight,
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.560]   and indeed the pathway that I'm describing
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.440]   can create a sense of fight and cause people
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.720]   to want to lean in in an aggressive way
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   to combat things that they're afraid of,
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:07.400]   or flight to run away, essentially to avoid by mobilizing
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.720]   the thing that they feel they're threatened by.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.840]   Now, even in the absence of some threat,
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.520]   somebody that has say a fear of public speaking
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.880]   might hesitate or move away from a podium
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.120]   or hesitate or move away from raising their hand
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.080]   if raising their hand meant that they might be called on
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.840]   and would be public speaking.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.960]   So there's fight and flight,
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.720]   but there's also the freeze response.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.960]   And the freeze response is controlled
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.000]   by a number of brain centers,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.480]   but the periaqueductal gray, the PAG,
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.720]   is central for this freeze response.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.840]   And neurons there also create
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.860]   what are called endogenous opioids.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.220]   Many of you have heard of the opioid crisis,
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.460]   which is a crisis of prescription medication
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.420]   given out too broadly for people that don't need it,
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.980]   who become addicted to opioids.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.080]   Those are exogenous opioids,
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.940]   but endogenous opioids are chemicals released from neurons
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.880]   in the PAG and from elsewhere in the body
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.520]   that give us a sense of numbing.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.000]   They actually numb us against pain.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.140]   And you can imagine why biology
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.740]   would be organized this way.
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.360]   A threat occurs or something that we perceive as a threat,
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.300]   we're afraid of it, and a natural analgesic
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.400]   is released into our body
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.320]   because there's likely to be an interaction
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.740]   that's very uncomfortable, that's physically uncomfortable.
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.440]   So it's like we have our own endogenous release
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.320]   of these opioids and that's occurring in the PAG.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.620]   The other area, and again,
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.280]   sorry to litter the conversation
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.000]   with these names of structures,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.160]   but some people seem to enjoy knowing these structures.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.920]   You're fine if you just understand what the structures do.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.320]   If you want to know the names, that's fine.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.520]   But the other structure is the locus coeruleus.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.480]   The locus coeruleus creates a sense of arousal
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.640]   by releasing adrenaline, epinephrine, and norepinephrine,
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.360]   a related chemical into the brain.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.360]   So basically the activation of the amygdaloid complex
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.100]   could be from any number of different things,
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.660]   a memory of something fearful,
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:57.400]   an actual sensory experience of something that's fearful.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:02.160]   But then the fear response itself is taking part
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.520]   because of the threat reflex gets activated.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.080]   And that threat reflex then sends a whole set
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.320]   of other functions into action,
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.400]   freezing, activation of the adrenals,
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.480]   activation of locus coeruleus for arousal and alertness,
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.980]   activation of this endogenous pain system
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.820]   or anti-pain system in the PAG.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.640]   That's one pathway out of the amygdala.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.960]   The other pathway out of the amygdala
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.560]   is to a very interesting area
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.000]   that typically is associated with reward and even addiction.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.520]   So this might come as a surprise to many of you.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.060]   In fact, it came as a surprise to me.
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.440]   I remember when these data were published,
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.040]   but the amygdaloid complex actually projects
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.560]   to areas of the dopamine system,
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.920]   the so-called nucleus accumbens,
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.640]   the mesolimbic reward pathway,
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.240]   for those of you that want to look that up
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.500]   or that remember from the dopamine episodes.
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.720]   We have pathways in our brain
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.280]   that are associated with pursuit, motivation, and reward.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.760]   And the neuromodulator dopamine is largely responsible
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.960]   for that feeling of craving, pursuit, and reward.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.360]   And this threat center is actually able to communicate with
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.400]   and activate the dopamine system.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.120]   And later you will realize why that is very important
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.580]   and why you can leverage the dopamine system
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.800]   in order to wire in new memories to replace fearful ones.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.680]   So I've been hitting you with a lot of names of things,
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.840]   but for the moment,
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.320]   even if you're interested in all the neuroscience names
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.280]   and structures and so forth,
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.680]   I'd like you to just conceptualize
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.680]   that you have a circuit in your brain,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.460]   meaning a set of cells and connections
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.120]   that are arranged in the following way.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.880]   You have a threat reflex that can be activated
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.040]   at any time very easily.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.360]   But what activates that threat reflex
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.880]   can depend on two things.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.000]   One are prior memories coming from brain areas
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.400]   that are involved in storage of memories,
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.480]   or it can be immediate experiences.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.760]   Things are happening in the now.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.160]   Okay, so we're something fearful to happen right now,
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.280]   your threat reflex could be activated.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.360]   Were you to remember something very scary
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.400]   that happened to you in the past,
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.040]   your threat reflex could be activated.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:07.040]   And that threat reflex circuit has two major outputs.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.340]   One of the major outputs is to areas
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.440]   that are involved in the threat response,
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.000]   freezing, pain management, and alertness.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.440]   And the other major output is to areas involved
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.360]   in reward, motivation, and reinforcement, okay?
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.040]   There's a fourth component,
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.820]   and I promise this is the last component
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.460]   that we need to put into this picture
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.080]   of the neural circuits for fear.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.040]   And this is a circuit that involves an area of the brain
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.000]   called the prefrontal cortex and some of its subdivisions.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.540]   So literally in the front.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:42.360]   And it's involved in what we call top-down processing.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.160]   Top-down processing is the way that your prefrontal cortex
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.800]   and other areas of the brain can control
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.760]   or suppress a reflex, okay?
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.640]   A good example of this would be the step on the tack example
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.480]   that I gave before.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.540]   So when you step on a tack,
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.200]   you immediately pull up your foot
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.540]   and you extend the other leg.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.440]   That's the reflex that prevents you
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.800]   from injuring yourself and from falling over.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:14.880]   However, if you wanted, not that you would want to,
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.160]   but if you wanted, you could, for instance,
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.240]   place your foot onto a tack
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.280]   and decide not to pull your foot away.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.320]   It would be difficult.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.160]   And again, I don't recommend that you do that,
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.320]   but you could override that reflex, okay?
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.280]   There are other examples of reflexes.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.160]   Like for instance, getting into cold water,
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.400]   most people will start to huddle their body.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.220]   Most people won't want to get into the cold water.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.160]   Many people will jump out.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.240]   But all of that is reflexive.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.000]   And should you want to,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.400]   you could override that reflex through top-down processing.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.400]   You could tell yourself,
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.380]   oh, I heard on a previous Huberman Lab podcast
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.060]   or on an Instagram post that cold water exposure
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.760]   can be beneficial for metabolism
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.040]   and resilience, et cetera, and indeed it can.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.240]   And you can decide to get into the water
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.840]   and to stretch out your body, not to huddle,
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.240]   and you can fight those reflexes, okay?
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.800]   The fighting of reflex is carried out
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.280]   through top-down processing,
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.080]   largely through the prefrontal cortex.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.900]   You provide a narrative.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.800]   You tell yourself, I want to do this, or I should do this,
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.680]   or even though I don't want to, I'm going to do it anyway.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.560]   So top-down processing
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.600]   is not just for getting into cold water.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.480]   And it certainly isn't for overriding reflexes
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.000]   that can damage us like stepping on the tack example.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.040]   It is the way in which we can override
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.280]   any number of internal reflexes,
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.120]   including the threat reflex.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:43.120]   And the way that we do that is by giving a new story
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.960]   or a new narrative to this experience that we call threat.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.480]   And you know the threat response.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.480]   The threat response is quickening of the heart rate,
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.040]   quickening of the breathing.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.440]   We don't generally like the feeling of adrenaline
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.280]   in our system.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.920]   A lot of people are so-called adrenaline junkies,
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.600]   and they get a mixture of dopamine and adrenaline
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.160]   from certain high-intensity events.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.000]   I confess in previous aspects of my life,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.880]   I've tended to like adrenaline.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.720]   I don't think I was at the extreme of thrill-seeking,
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.940]   but I'm somebody that, for instance, I tend to like.
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.520]   I like roller coasters.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.600]   I've done various things where I'm familiar with
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.660]   and I enjoy the sensation of adrenaline in my body,
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.600]   but I enjoy it because of the alertness that it brings
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.340]   and the hyperacuity that it brings.
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.920]   Many people don't feel that way.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.520]   In fact, most people don't like the sensation
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.760]   of a lot of adrenaline in their system.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.020]   It makes them feel very uncomfortable and out of control.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.260]   We will do an entire episode about adrenaline
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.980]   and adrenaline junkies and adrenaline aversives
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.140]   in the future, but the threat reflex
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.340]   inevitably involves the release of adrenaline
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.700]   into the system.
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.740]   And then it becomes a question of whether or not
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.060]   you remain still, move forward, or retreat
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.440]   from that adrenaline experience.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.760]   And when I say the adrenaline experience,
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.120]   I mean the threat reflex.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.040]   So this fourth component of fear
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.140]   is really our ability to attach narrative,
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.080]   to attach meaning, and to attach purpose
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.720]   to what is, by all accounts and purposes, a generic response.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.720]   There's no negotiating what fear feels like.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.200]   There's only negotiating what it means.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.640]   There's only negotiating whether or not you persist,
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.180]   whether or not you pause, or whether or not you retreat.
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.220]   So this is usually the point in the podcast
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.260]   where I think people start asking,
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.380]   "Okay, well, there's the biology, there's the mechanism,
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.180]   there's the logic, how do I eliminate fear?"
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.700]   Well, it's not quite that simple,
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.340]   although by understanding the logic and the mechanisms
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.260]   by which these circuits are built,
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.060]   we can eventually get to that place.
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:46.500]   I do want to plant a flag around a particular type of tool
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.180]   or a logical framework around a particular set of tools,
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.980]   rather, that we are going to build out through this episode.
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.960]   And based on what you now know,
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:01.640]   that the threat reflex gets input and it has outputs,
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.660]   and it's subject to these top-down processing events,
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:10.040]   these narratives, you should be asking yourself,
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.960]   "What sort of narrative should I apply to eliminate fear?"
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.700]   Well, first let's take a step back
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.660]   and just acknowledge the reality,
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:23.660]   which is that fear is, in some cases, an adaptive response.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.820]   We don't want people eliminating fears
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.260]   that can get them injured or killed, right?
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.360]   The reason that the fear threat response
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.520]   and reflex exists at all is to help us from dying,
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.020]   to help us from making really bad decisions.
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.800]   It just so happens that a number of things happen to us
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.960]   that are not lethal, that don't harm us,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.140]   but that harm us from the inside.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.860]   And I think that, and here I'm borrowing language
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.860]   from an excellent researcher
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.040]   who's done important work in this area at Harvard.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.060]   His name is Dr. Kerry Ressler.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.780]   He's both a medical doctor and a PhD, so an MD PhD.
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.120]   He's the chief scientific officer at McLean Hospital.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.420]   He's a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School,
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.420]   and he's done extensive and important work on fear.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.960]   I'm going to refer back to Dr. Ressler's work
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.520]   several times during this podcast,
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.760]   including important and super interesting work
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.640]   on transgenerational passage of trauma.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.580]   He's a absolutely world-class biologist,
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.000]   absolutely world-class clinician.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.880]   And Dr. Ressler has described fear before
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.760]   as containing a historical component.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.180]   So it's not just about a readiness for things
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:39.340]   that might injure us or kill us in the immediate circumstance
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.080]   but also protecting us for the future
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.160]   because of our important need and ability to anticipate.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:49.160]   And what he describes are memories as protective
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.520]   or memories as dangerous.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.240]   Some memories, even if they evoke a sense of fear in us
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.140]   are protective.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.120]   They protect us from making bad mistakes
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.960]   that could get us injured or killed
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.680]   or put us into really horrible circumstances.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:06.620]   Other memories are dangerous because they create a sense
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.980]   in us of discomfort and they tend to limit our behavior
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.860]   in ways that are maladaptive,
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.680]   that prevent us from having healthy relationships to others,
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.720]   healthy job relationships,
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.300]   healthy relationship to ourselves, frankly.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.520]   So this language of memories as protective
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.180]   or memories as dangerous in the context of fear
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.360]   is not something that I said.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.100]   It's really something that I lifted from Dr. Ressler
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.580]   in one of his many impressive lectures.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.780]   And it's an important aspect of fear
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:40.260]   because much of the fear system is a memory system.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.800]   It's designed to embed a memory
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.180]   of certain previous experiences in us
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.680]   such that the threat reflex is activated
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:52.800]   in the anticipation of what might happen, okay?
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.500]   So let's talk for a second about how certain memories
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.140]   get attached to this fear system.
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.480]   And this brings us to a beautiful
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.800]   and indeed Nobel prize-winning aspect
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.700]   of biology and physiology, which is Pavlovian conditioning.
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.180]   Many of you are probably familiar with Pavlov's dogs
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.480]   and the famous Pavlovian conditioning experiments.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.220]   They go something like this.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:15.000]   You know, if you and Pavlov did these experiments
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.640]   and ring a bell, a dog doesn't do much
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.160]   in response to a bell, it might attend to it,
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.680]   but it doesn't salivate typically in response to the bell.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.500]   However, if you pair the ringing of a bell
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.340]   with a presentation of food enough times,
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.560]   the dog will salivate in response to the food.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.860]   Eventually you take away the food, you just ring the bell
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.900]   and the dog will salivate in response to the bell, okay?
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.600]   So in the context of so-called Pavlovian conditioning,
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.620]   these things have names like conditioned stimulus
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.100]   and unconditioned stimulus and responses.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.480]   People often get these mixed up
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.040]   and it can be a little confusing,
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.140]   but I'm just going to make it really simple for you.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.860]   The unconditioned stimulus is the thing
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.800]   that evokes a response unconditionally.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.880]   So food is the unconditioned stimulus
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.360]   in the example I just gave.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.980]   A foot shock or a loud bang
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:03.100]   would be the unconditioned stimulus in, for instance,
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.460]   an experiment geared toward exploring fear.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.700]   That unconditioned stimulus is unconditional.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.120]   It unconditionally evokes a startle
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.280]   or in the case of food, salivating.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.000]   The bell in the previous example
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.420]   is what we call the conditioned stimulus
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.960]   or the conditioning stimulus.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.320]   Sometimes people mix these up.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.260]   The conditioned stimulus is paired
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:30.580]   with the thing that naturally creates a response.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:32.620]   And then eventually the conditioned stimulus
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.520]   creates the response itself.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.360]   You might think, well,
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.920]   that just seems endlessly boring and simple,
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.340]   but this is actually the way that our fear systems work.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.800]   Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.660]   you don't need many, many pairings of a bell
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.860]   with some unconditioned stimulus
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.200]   in order to get a response.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.020]   You can get what's called one trial learning.
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.500]   And in this circuit that involves the amygdala,
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.920]   the threat reflex, and all this other stuff
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.280]   that I was talking about earlier,
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.500]   the system is set up for learning.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.700]   It's set up to create memories and to anticipate problems.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:10.880]   It's a very good system
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.240]   because it was designed to keep us safe.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:17.900]   And so the way to think about this is that for many people,
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:22.440]   one intense experience, one burn, one bad breakup,
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.640]   one bad experience, public speaking,
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.660]   one bad experience with somebody's pet snake
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.300]   or whatever it happens to be
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:33.420]   can cause intense fear in the moment,
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.020]   a long reverberatory experience of fear,
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.280]   like trouble sleeping that night and the following night,
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.340]   memories of the experience that are troubling,
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.480]   physiological responses that are troubling.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:48.120]   Essentially, it gets wired in as a fear with one trial,
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:48.960]   which is quite different
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.780]   than the other forms of neuroplasticity.
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:51.700]   Neuroplasticity, of course,
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.840]   just being the nervous system's ability to change
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.020]   in response to experience.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.380]   Other forms of neuroplasticity, like learning a language,
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:02.380]   learning music, learning math, those take a while.
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.280]   We don't generally get one trial learning
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.100]   to positive or neutral experiences.
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.060]   We get one trial learning to negative experiences.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.180]   So there's this asymmetry in how we're wired.
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.640]   So now you should understand how classical conditioning,
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.800]   as it's called, occurs.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.460]   You go to give a piano recital as a kid,
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.500]   you sit down and you freeze up,
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.400]   and it's horribly embarrassing.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.420]   And even if you just freeze up for a few seconds,
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:30.540]   the heart rate increase and the perspiring, the sweating,
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.100]   and the shame that you feel
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.220]   leads you to want to avoid playing instruments
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.960]   or public displays of performances
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.740]   for a long period of time
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.500]   unless you do something to overcome it.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.980]   That's one trial learning.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.340]   Some people, it tends to be more
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.140]   an accumulation of experiences.
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.740]   They have a bad relationship that lasts an entire summer,
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.740]   an entire year, or God forbid, a decade.
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.960]   And then they have what they feel
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.660]   is kind of a general sense of fear
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.820]   about closeness to others and attachment.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.260]   These are common fears that people experience.
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.480]   Fears can be in the short term,
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.540]   fears can be in the long term,
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.740]   they can be in the medium term.
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.780]   Again, the fear system is very generic.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.420]   It's wired to include memories that are very acute,
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.060]   that happen within a moment,
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.420]   or that include many, many events and long periods of time
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.760]   that kind of funnel into a general sense
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.320]   of relationships are bad
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.740]   or this particular city or location is bad.
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:32.360]   So there's a key, what we call temporal component.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.740]   There's a component of the fear system
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:38.220]   being able to batch many events in time
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.780]   and create one specific fear
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.820]   or take one very specific isolated incident
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.060]   that happened very briefly
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:48.060]   and create one very large general sense of fears.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.580]   And I'll give an example of the latter
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.580]   just to kind of flesh this out a little bit.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.980]   I had a friend come visit me in San Francisco some years ago
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.500]   and their car got broken into,
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.500]   unfortunately a frequent occurrence in San Francisco
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.340]   and in the middle of the day,
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.020]   never leave anything in your car in San Francisco.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.740]   They'll break in in the middle of the day, doesn't matter.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.580]   Police can be having coffee right there in front of them.
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:12.260]   They'll still do it for reasons we could discuss.
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.680]   This is a problem.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.240]   They got their belongings taken
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.260]   and they decided they were never coming back
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.480]   to San Francisco.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.100]   This was an isolated incident
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:24.860]   that forever colored their view of the city,
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.600]   which I, frankly, understanding the fear system,
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.180]   I can understand.
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.640]   We can have isolated incidents
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.720]   that wick out to broad decisions about entire places,
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.820]   or we can have many experiences
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.940]   that funnel into very specific isolated fears
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.700]   about particular circumstances, places, and things.
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.960]   So I like to think that by now
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.840]   you have a pretty good understanding
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.240]   of the circuits that underlie the threat reflex,
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.980]   the fear response, and how we have top-down control,
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:57.080]   meaning we can attach a narrative to the fear response,
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.680]   and that the fear response can be learned
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.200]   in association with particular events, okay?
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.100]   I haven't really talked about how the learning occurs.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.180]   And so I just want to take a moment and describe that
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.200]   because it leads right into our discussion
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.460]   about how to eliminate fears,
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.080]   and indeed how to replace fears
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.260]   with more positive experiences.
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.840]   There's a process in our nervous system
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.360]   that we call neuroplasticity.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.000]   Neuroplasticity, broadly defined,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.800]   is the nervous system's ability
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.100]   to change in response to experience.
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.360]   But at a cellular level,
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.200]   that occurs through a couple of different mechanisms.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.440]   One of the main mechanisms
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.520]   is something called long-term potentiation.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.680]   Long-term potentiation involves the strengthening
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.820]   of particular connections between neurons,
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.360]   the connection sites between neurons we call synapses.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.680]   Actually, technically synapses
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.000]   are the gaps between those connections.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.820]   But nonetheless, synapses are the point of communication
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.280]   between neurons, and those can be strengthened
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.260]   so that certain neurons can talk to other neurons
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.720]   more robustly than they happened to before.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.960]   And anytime we talk about a particular event,
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.080]   the car, the snake, the public speaking,
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.660]   the trauma, the horrible experience,
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:09.280]   wiring into the fear system,
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.320]   what we're talking about is a change in synaptic strengths.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.620]   We're talking about neurons
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.580]   that previously did not communicate well
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:17.920]   communicating very well.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.720]   It's like going from a old school dial-up connection
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.500]   or even an old school telephone connection
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.180]   or Morse code connection of communication
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.960]   to high-speed ethernet, okay, to a 5G connection.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.140]   It gets faster, it gets more robust,
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.960]   and it's very, very clear.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.080]   That's what happens when you get long-term potentiation.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.480]   And long-term potentiation involves a couple of cellular
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.120]   mechanisms that are going to be relevant to our discussion
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.160]   about treatments to undo fear.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.600]   And I'll just throw out a couple of the names
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.280]   of some of those cellular elements right now.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.440]   The main one is the so-called NMDA receptor,
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.520]   N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.920]   And what this is is this is a little docking site,
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.200]   like a little parking slot on a neuron.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.120]   And when a neuron gets activated very strongly,
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.920]   like from an intense event,
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.540]   in the example of my friend, the intense event,
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.260]   almost certainly activated NMDA receptors related
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.360]   to their concept of protecting their property in their cars.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.760]   The break into their car caused the NMDA receptor
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.320]   to be activated.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.240]   Normally that NMDA receptor is not easily activated.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.880]   And when it is activated, it sets off a cascade,
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.800]   a series of signals within those neurons
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.020]   that change those neurons.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.760]   It changes the genes they express.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.840]   It shuttles more parking spots to the surface
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.000]   of those cells so that the communication
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.260]   to those cells becomes easier.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:40.560]   It becomes faster.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.560]   And so the way to think about the NMDA receptor
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.320]   is it's used sometimes for normal things
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.920]   that we do every day, making cups of coffee
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.720]   and things like that, but it's often used for learning.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.580]   It's used for creating new associations
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.000]   in our nervous system.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.720]   And so the activation of the NMDA receptor and LTP,
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.860]   and it involves some other things that you may have heard
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.980]   of like brain-derived nootropic factors
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.000]   and calcium entry, things that we can leave
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.920]   for a discussion for a future time,
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.720]   but basically a whole cascade of events happen
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:15.040]   within cells that then make just even the mere thought
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:19.220]   of something or somebody or some event that happened,
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.480]   able to activate that threat reflex, okay?
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.480]   So long-term potentiation is one of the main mechanisms
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:29.780]   by which we take formally innocuous or irrelevant events
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:31.900]   and we make them scary.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.680]   We make them traumatic.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.020]   Our neurons have mechanisms to do this.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.440]   Now, fortunately, the NMDA receptor
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:42.000]   and long-term potentiation can also run the whole system
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.140]   in reverse.
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.620]   You can get what's called long-term depression.
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.700]   And that doesn't have anything to do
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.600]   with the depression associated with low mood.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.900]   What we're talking about is a weakening of connections.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.880]   You can go from having a very high speed ethernet connection
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.780]   between neurons, so to speak,
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.700]   to a connection that's more like Morse code
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:04.220]   or is like a poor dial-up connection, a really weak signal.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.240]   And that's what's happening when you extinguish a fear,
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.140]   when you unlearn a fear.
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.760]   So now I'd like to talk about therapies
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.860]   that are carried out in humans
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.380]   that allow fears to be undone,
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.800]   that allow traumas to be reversed
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.580]   such that people no longer feel bad
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.740]   about a particular person, place, or thing,
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.660]   either real interactions with that person, place, or thing,
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:32.660]   or imagined interactions with that person, place, or thing.
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:35.340]   That process, as I just mentioned,
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.980]   also involves things like the NMDA receptor,
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:41.560]   but rather than strengthening the connections,
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.940]   the first thing that has to happen
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.060]   is there needs to be a weakening of connections
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.960]   that associate the person, place, or thing
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.860]   with that threat reflex.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.660]   Subsequent to that, we will see
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:55.020]   there needs to be a strengthening of some new experience
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.580]   that's positive, okay?
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.860]   This is a key element of where we are headed.
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:01.480]   Contrary to popular belief,
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:06.260]   it is not going to work to simply extinguish a fear.
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:10.660]   One needs to extinguish a fear and/or trauma
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:15.420]   and replace that fearful or traumatic memory or idea
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.500]   or response with a positive response.
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.260]   And this is something that's rarely discussed
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.760]   both in the scientific literature,
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.200]   but certainly in the general discussion
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.540]   around fear and trauma.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.600]   There's this idea that we can extinguish fears,
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.060]   we can rewire ourselves, we can eliminate our traumas,
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:35.620]   and indeed we can, but that process has to involve
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.240]   not just becoming comfortable
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.180]   with a particular fearful event or trauma,
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:44.080]   but also attaching a new positive experience
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.660]   to that previously fearful or traumatic event.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.280]   There are a lot of different approaches out there
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:55.100]   that are in clinical use to try and alleviate fear and trauma
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.960]   and indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:02.180]   It might be surprising to learn
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.820]   that many of those treatments, such as SSRIs,
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.580]   the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.540]   things like Prozac and Zoloft and similar,
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:16.120]   and other antidepressants, or things like benzodiazepines,
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.600]   which are essentially like painkillers.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.560]   They create elevation in certain transmitters in the brain,
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.260]   like GABA among others.
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:27.540]   They can have a pain-relieving effect.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:30.220]   They are generally, however, considered anxiolytics.
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.800]   They reduce anxiety.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:37.100]   And even antipsychotic drugs or beta blockers,
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:38.900]   sometimes called adrenergic blockers,
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.760]   drugs that are designed to prevent the heart
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.420]   from beating too fast or to reduce blood pressure,
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:45.540]   to reduce some elements
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.940]   of that hypothalamic pituitary axis response
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.500]   that we talked about earlier.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.940]   Many people experience some degree of relief
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:56.580]   from the symptoms of anxiety and fear and PTSD
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:59.420]   in taking these various compounds.
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:02.140]   Indeed, that's why they're prescribed so broadly.
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:05.720]   But you may find it interesting to note
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.080]   that none of those current treatments
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.540]   are based on the neurobiology of fear,
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.480]   at least not directly, right?
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.700]   People that take SSRIs oftentimes will experience
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.980]   a reduction in anxiety.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:20.460]   It depends on the dosage and the individual, of course, right?
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.540]   And you have to work with a doctor,
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.540]   a psychiatrist to determine whether or not
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.260]   they're right for you in the correct dosage
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.780]   if they are right for you.
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:31.780]   But that modulation of anxiety can indirectly
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:35.080]   reduce the likelihood that one will have a panic attack
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.860]   or experience a fear, an intense experience of fear,
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:39.460]   a reliving of a trauma.
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:43.180]   But the SSRIs themselves are not plugging
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.620]   into some specific mechanism related
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:47.860]   to how fear comes about in the system.
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.620]   It's an indirect support.
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:55.720]   That's important because if the goal of modern psychiatry
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.620]   and the goal of modern biology is to provide
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:02.180]   mechanistic understanding that leads to treatments,
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:04.540]   we need to think about what are the sorts of treatments
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.760]   that tap into the very fear circuits
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.900]   that we described before?
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.500]   The fact that there are memories attached
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.860]   to a generic threat reflex and response,
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:16.060]   and the threat reflex response can be linked up
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.700]   with the dopamine system and can be linked up
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.760]   with other systems that are involved in pain relief
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.380]   and anxiety and so forth.
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:24.600]   And so that brings us to which treatments
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.860]   are directly related to the fear circuitry
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.020]   and the circuitry related to trauma.
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:33.060]   And the primary one to begin with
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.840]   is the so-called behavioral therapies.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:40.320]   Now, oftentimes we all wish, I think, from time to time,
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.380]   that there's some specific pill that we can take
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.500]   or there's some machine or device
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:44.740]   that we can plug our finger into,
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:47.460]   or that we can put on a headset and all of a sudden
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.000]   we just rewire our nervous system,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.540]   fear is gone, trauma is gone, but it doesn't work that way.
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:56.540]   And when we think of language and narrative as a tool
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:59.580]   to rewire our nervous system
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.500]   in comparison to those kinds of ideas
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.260]   about pills and machines and potions,
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.240]   it starts to seem a little bit weak, right?
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.180]   If we just think, oh, well,
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:10.340]   how could talking actually change the way
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.580]   that we respond to something?
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.660]   But actually there are three forms of therapy
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:18.140]   that purely through the use of language
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:21.460]   have been shown to have very strong positive impact,
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:24.200]   meaning reduced fears and traumas.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.680]   And those three are prolonged exposure therapy,
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.800]   cognitive processing, or CPT,
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.640]   and cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.320]   And I'm not going to go into the entire literature
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.720]   around prolonged exposure, cognitive processing,
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.520]   and cognitive behavioral therapy,
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:41.320]   but I will just illustrate the central theme
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.180]   that allows them to work.
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:46.780]   Now, remember that the circuit for fear,
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.980]   the circuit for trauma involves this generic reflex,
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:51.700]   and then there are those top-down elements
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.000]   coming from the forebrain.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.880]   It's very clear because it's been measured
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.920]   that if you look at the amount of anxiety,
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.620]   the pure physiological anxiety response
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:08.880]   of quickening of heart rate, blushing of the skin,
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:12.980]   sometimes quaking of the hands, the experience of fear,
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:17.780]   over time, when people recount or retell their trauma,
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.140]   that the first time they do that,
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:23.540]   especially when it's recounted in a lot of detail,
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:26.720]   there's a tremendous anxiety response,
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.360]   sometimes even as great or greater
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:32.900]   than the actual exposure to the fearful event or trauma.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.180]   And obviously this is something
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:37.440]   that is done with a clinician present
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.900]   because it is very traumatic to the person.
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:43.220]   They're literally reliving the trauma in full rich detail,
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:46.720]   and they are encouraged to provide full rich detail.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.020]   They're often encouraged to speak in complete sentences,
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:54.060]   to flesh out details about how they felt inside,
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.460]   to flesh out details about their memories
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:59.740]   going into this traumatic or fearful event,
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:03.780]   going through it, and after really digging in
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.000]   to all the nuance and contours
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.700]   of these horrible experiences.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.760]   But what's remarkable is that in the second and the third
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:17.060]   and the fourth retelling of these traumatic
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:20.060]   or fearful events, that anxiety response
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.840]   and the amount of the physiological response,
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:24.380]   I should say that the amplitude
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.080]   of the physiological response
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:29.540]   becomes progressively diminished with each retelling.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.580]   Now, some of you might be saying, well, duh,
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:37.900]   tell a story enough times that eventually it wears off,
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:39.360]   just like if you watch a movie enough times
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.300]   and you hear the same joke enough times,
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:44.600]   eventually it doesn't have the same impact.
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.380]   But that needn't be the case, right?
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:50.640]   You could imagine that this high amplitude anxiety response,
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.100]   this high amplitude activation
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:54.840]   of the sympathetic nervous system in retelling
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:59.520]   would actually create a even deeper routed
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:02.500]   fear response and trauma, but that's not what happens.
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.780]   And every clinician I spoke to
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:06.300]   in anticipation of this episode,
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.660]   which include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists,
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.940]   and people who actually work on the fear system
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:13.940]   at a biological level, said the exact same thing,
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:17.460]   which is that a detailed recounting
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:21.800]   of the traumatic and fearful events is absolutely essential
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:25.620]   in order to get the positive effects of prolonged exposure,
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.080]   cognitive processing, and cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.560]   Again, this has to be done with the appropriate support.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.940]   This isn't something that should be taken lightly
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:34.900]   because as we've mentioned before,
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:38.540]   the fear response can have a very long lasting contour
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:41.100]   to it, people can sometimes have trouble sleeping
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.480]   for days and days, and afterwards,
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.100]   we'll talk about sleep in a little bit,
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:48.580]   but the point is that the retelling is important.
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:52.780]   And the idea here is to take what was a terrible
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:57.720]   and extremely troubling, meaning physiologically troubling,
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.820]   psychologically troubling story,
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:04.820]   and turn it into what is essentially a boring bag
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:06.580]   story, okay?
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:09.660]   It never really becomes a good story at this point
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.340]   in the treatment process that we're describing.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:15.960]   So a terrible event is a terrible event, period,
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:19.260]   but there's a way in which the retelling of that event
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:24.260]   starts to uncouple the threat reflex from the narrative.
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:28.300]   And with each successive retelling in detail
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:31.520]   of these traumatic events, of these fearful events,
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:36.520]   the threat reflex is activated at a progressively lower
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:40.640]   and lower amplitude, such that eventually it just becomes
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.440]   a really bad, really boring story.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:48.080]   Now that's one part of the process of getting over a fear.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.540]   It's what we call fear extinction.
[00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:53.380]   And we can bring ourselves back to our earlier example
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:56.460]   of Pavlovian conditioning because many studies have been
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.440]   done both in animals and in humans showing that,
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.380]   for instance, if you pair a tone, you know,
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:05.260]   a bell or a buzzer with a foot shock,
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.040]   that an animal or a person will brace themselves
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.020]   for the foot shock.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:12.560]   Eventually you can just give the bell or tone
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.940]   and the person will experience that same freezing up
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.660]   or the same fight or flight or freeze response.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:19.660]   So you condition that.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:23.460]   But if you give the tone or the bell over and over,
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.860]   and there's no foot shock, there's no pain.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:27.740]   And in humans, this is sometimes done with foot shock,
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:29.760]   sometimes believe it or not with mild burn.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.440]   There are even some studies, there's older studies,
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.680]   you couldn't do those now, nor would you want to.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:37.320]   But eventually what happens is the tone,
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:41.000]   the bell no longer evokes that response, okay?
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.540]   So you see this as a reversal of the classical conditioning
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.760]   and we call that reversal extinction.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.420]   So the retelling of this traumatic or fearful narrative,
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:55.020]   excuse me, fearful narrative is essentially
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.180]   an extinction process.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:56:59.820]   Now, how is this done?
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:02.860]   One can do this in a therapist's office face-to-face,
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:03.860]   that's sometimes done.
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:05.800]   It's sometimes done in group type settings
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.280]   where people actually stand up
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:09.660]   or sit in front of a group, small or large,
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:12.740]   and recount in detail their traumatic experience.
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:16.780]   It's sometimes done by people writing out
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.740]   the experience in detail.
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:21.740]   And which one of these is most effective
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:23.020]   isn't really clear.
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:25.920]   The literature points to the fact that a feeling of trust,
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:29.040]   obviously between the patient and the clinician
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.740]   or the person and the group is essential.
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.100]   Some people don't have access to because of finances
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:36.660]   or other limitations to therapy of that sort.
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:38.400]   In that case, journaling in detail
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.540]   has been shown to be effective.
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:43.520]   Although again, I want to caution people
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.540]   about reactivating traumas without consideration
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.020]   for the kinds of social support they might need
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:50.700]   around that reactivation.
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:51.860]   And we will talk a little bit later
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:54.260]   about some of the chemicals involved in social support
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:56.680]   and why those help extinguish fears.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:58.700]   So the thing to embed in your mind
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:02.040]   is that recognition of the early traumatic
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:05.820]   or fearful event in detail over and over
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:10.820]   is key to forming a new non-traumatic association
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:14.240]   with that event or person.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.140]   So that's part one.
[00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:18.880]   You need to diminish the old experience.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:22.280]   And when I say diminish, I mean reduce the amplitude
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.280]   of the physiological response.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.180]   Now, this is just but one approach.
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:27.560]   I'm going to talk about other approaches
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:31.240]   to eliminating fear and trauma as we go forward.
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:34.040]   But I want to emphasize that diminishing the amplitude
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:36.440]   of the physiological response is the first step.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:39.360]   So it's like a clearing away of the association
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:42.860]   between the person, place or thing and that threat reflex.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:46.620]   But even after that's occurred,
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:50.760]   there's an essential need to relearn a new narrative.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.700]   Why is there essential need to relearn a new narrative
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:56.320]   or create a new association?
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:59.320]   Well, that has to do with that fear reflex circuitry.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:02.920]   As you recall, there are outputs to areas of the brain
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:06.200]   that are associated with dopamine release and reinforcement.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.960]   And that we now know offers the capacity
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.760]   for these fear circuits and these circuits
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:14.880]   that underlie trauma to be mapped onto new experiences
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.460]   that are of positive association.
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.360]   So I'm going to give a kind of basic example.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.320]   It's a kind of a silly example,
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:26.280]   but I'm giving it as a template for what could be
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.520]   any number of other different examples.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:32.000]   Example I'll give is let's say a kid is biking
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.140]   to play soccer, soccer practice,
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:38.660]   and they get into a bad car accident, okay?
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:42.180]   Terrible thing to happen, but they survive, they recover.
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:45.440]   And somehow, and we really don't know why
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.880]   certain fear memories get wired in more broadly
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:50.280]   or more narrowly.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:54.080]   Somehow this kid just doesn't even want to bicycle anymore.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.600]   And they actually don't even want to play sports.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.400]   And they actually just don't want to go anywhere.
[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.880]   They're kind of isolating and not interacting
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.000]   with friends very much at all.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.280]   It's a pretty broad response.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.640]   It didn't have to be that way.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.840]   Some kids would just decide they don't want to cycle anymore
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.520]   down that particular street.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.120]   Well, the process of retelling the narrative
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.460]   to a clinician would allow an extinction
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.960]   of the fear response, right?
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.400]   So a reduction in the heart rate,
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.920]   a reduction in the narrowing of focus,
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.680]   a reduction in all the things that we consider fear,
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.560]   but a really good cognitive behavioral therapist
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:29.280]   or somebody that understands the neuroscience
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:32.440]   of fear and trauma would understand
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.240]   that that's not sufficient.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.160]   That's what's really important is that this child,
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.960]   this hypothetical child relearn a new narrative
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.220]   that they don't just manage to bike to soccer practice
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:45.160]   or manage to spend time with friends,
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:49.520]   but that they actually start wiring in new positive
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.840]   associations with biking to practice,
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.280]   with playing soccer, with social events.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.240]   And, and this is the somewhat surprising feature of this,
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.300]   and that they link that back
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.640]   to that early traumatic experience.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.440]   That it's not just that they're replacing
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.420]   a bad experience and memory with a good experience
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:11.760]   and memory, but they're actually holding in mind
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.800]   in these top-down narrative circuits, if you will,
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.880]   they're holding in mind, ah,
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.400]   I'm not just biking to soccer practice.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.920]   I'm actually biking to soccer practice
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.440]   and I'm enjoying it despite the fact
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.920]   that I was in a bad car accident,
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.580]   despite the fact that two months ago or two years ago,
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.880]   or maybe even 10 years ago, I couldn't even leave my room
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.980]   or I didn't want to associate with anybody.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:37.400]   So the building up of the positive associations are key.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.140]   And the linking of those positive associations
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.760]   with the earlier traumatic event is key
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.560]   for the following reason.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.680]   The top-down circuitry from the prefrontal cortex
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.080]   to this threat reflex circuit is not like
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.200]   the other connections in that circuit.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.800]   The other connections in that circuit
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.940]   are what we call glutamatergic and excitatory.
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.800]   They are all about activating other neurons,
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.800]   like a chain reaction.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.520]   One neuron activates, the next activates,
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.020]   the next like dominoes falling.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:13.720]   These top-down circuits that feed into the threat reflex,
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.180]   and all its parts, is what we call inhibitory.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:23.180]   It tends to prevent activation of those given circuitries.
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:26.320]   It tends to prevent activation of the threat reflex.
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.160]   So it's acting as a break.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.740]   And so when we think of positive experiences
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.440]   being associated with what was previously
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.000]   a negative experience, we're not talking about forgetting
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.480]   that the car accident was horrible,
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.040]   or forgetting that the assault was absolutely dreadful.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:46.500]   We're talking about attaching a new positive memory
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:51.500]   to the circuitry so that the previous fear response
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.500]   is far less likely to occur,
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.800]   and that it remains extinguished.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.760]   So just to make sure this is absolutely clear,
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.720]   there's a first step which involves retelling and reliving
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.060]   in order to extinguish the fear and the trauma,
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.280]   to reduce the amplitude of the response.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.280]   Then there's a need to replace or attach positive experiences
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.720]   to the earlier what would be traumatic response.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.640]   The extinction has to go first.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.800]   This is key.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.520]   You can't simply say, oh, you know,
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.400]   the car accident was actually a good thing
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.300]   because I stayed home a lot that year and I got to study.
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.400]   You can tell yourself that, and that could also be true,
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.540]   but that won't necessarily, and probably won't,
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:33.340]   eliminate the fear or the traumatic association
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:34.640]   of the car accident.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.080]   And again, I'm using car accident as a general example
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.120]   or a generic example here, okay?
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.460]   So there's a three-part process.
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.440]   One, diminish the old experience
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.540]   through repetitive narrative.
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:50.000]   And almost inevitably, the initial repetition of that
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.840]   is going to be very high amplitude and quite troubling,
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.440]   but over time it will reduce, right?
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.560]   You're turning the terrible, really upsetting story
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.900]   into a terrible, boring story.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.240]   That's the extinction process.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.440]   Then there's a relearning of a new narrative
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.380]   that includes some sort of sense of reward,
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.080]   and that sense of reward has to be tacked back
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.840]   onto the traumatic event
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.800]   or what was previously a traumatic event.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.960]   And that is all through narrative.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.640]   It's all through cognition.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.720]   And I think this is a very important point.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.960]   Oftentimes I think we tend to undervalue
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.800]   the importance of rationalization
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.960]   and of story and of narrative.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.440]   But the prefrontal cortex is this amazing capacity
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.880]   of our brain real estate to create meaning,
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.720]   to attach meaning and purpose
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.560]   to things that otherwise are just reflexive.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.400]   And in the example of an ice bath,
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.840]   it might be a little trivial.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.600]   In the example of the kid with the car accident,
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.600]   it becomes a little more relevant.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:50.600]   And in the example of things like people surviving genocide
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:56.440]   or attaching stories of great victory
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.680]   to what were previously thought of as stories of great loss,
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:03.760]   of time, of people, of any number of things,
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.440]   that process of narrative is one of the major ways
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.700]   that the human brain rewires itself.
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:12.560]   Narrative should not be undervalued
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.200]   as a tool for relieving fear and trauma.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.520]   In fact, narrative is one of the best and most potent ways
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.800]   that we can rewire our fear circuitry,
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.680]   and that indeed we can form completely new relationships
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.200]   to things over time.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.600]   So basically, narrative should not be undervalued
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.480]   as a tool to rewire our nervous system,
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.120]   but it has to be engaged in the correct sequence.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.820]   And that correct sequence is first extinction,
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:42.720]   then relearning a new narrative with positive associations
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.840]   and attaching those positive associations
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.040]   to the formerly traumatic or fearful event.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.100]   Now, I mentioned prolonged exposure therapy,
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:53.020]   cognitive processing, and cognitive behavioral therapy.
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.520]   For those of you that are seeking relief
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.660]   from fear and traumatic events,
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:02.040]   you can look up licensed clinicians that can carry out
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.880]   those one or several of those types of therapies.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.740]   I get a lot of questions about other forms of therapy.
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:11.820]   One of the ones that comes up a lot is so-called EMDR,
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:14.440]   eye movement desensitization reprocessing,
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:17.840]   developed by Francine Shapiro in the '80s.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.780]   Eye movement desensitization reprocessing
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.680]   involves moving the eyes side to side
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:26.000]   while recounting a traumatic or fearful narrative,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.480]   typically with a clinician present.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.680]   Why would that work?
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:35.520]   Well, basically, when I first heard about EMDR
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.220]   from my stance as a vision scientist,
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:38.060]   I thought the whole thing
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:40.620]   was kind of crazy and half-baked, frankly.
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:43.780]   I heard these theories that, oh, it recreates
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:47.160]   the eye movements in rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.380]   And that's completely false.
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.560]   It does not.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:55.560]   I heard the argument EMDR activates both sides of the brain,
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.280]   which I guess hypothetically
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:02.280]   was thought to be important somehow, and frankly,
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.860]   there's no evidence whatsoever
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:05.960]   that EMDR activates both sides of the brain
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.440]   in a way that's beneficial.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.120]   I mean, by looking from side to side,
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.300]   just because of the way that binocular visual circuits
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.640]   are organized, it will do that,
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.360]   but it never made any sense to me why EMDR would work
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:20.360]   until several years ago when I saw, because I reviewed,
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.320]   no fewer than five papers,
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.500]   some in animal models, others in humans,
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.000]   looking at lateral eye movements,
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.120]   meaning eye movements from side to side with eyes open,
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.560]   not eyes up or down,
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.560]   and what was observed in these experiments,
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.960]   in all of them actually, all five of those papers,
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:41.520]   was a dramatic reduction in the activation
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.680]   and actually an inhibition, a suppression,
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.040]   of the fear or threat reflex circuitry,
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.140]   which was a jaw dropper for me.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:53.000]   I thought, wow, actually it was a jaw dropper,
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.720]   eye widener for me.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.400]   I thought, oh my goodness,
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:00.360]   maybe this EMDR stuff works according to some mechanism,
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:01.520]   and maybe this is the mechanism,
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.580]   and indeed many laboratories, not mine,
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.720]   but many laboratories are now pursuing that idea,
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.760]   and it's looking very likely.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.200]   Why would that happen?
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.880]   Well, just very briefly,
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.940]   lateralized eye movements of the sort that I'm describing,
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:15.240]   and I'm moving my hand like this,
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.260]   but I'll just do it with my eyes,
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:19.360]   even though it's a little embarrassing to do that,
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.960]   'cause I know it looks strange, I don't mind,
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.880]   'cause I'm doing EMDR,
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.640]   and EMDR reduces activation of the amygdala
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.120]   and related circuitries, which reduces anxiety
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.720]   and reduces the amplitude of the threat reflex,
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.480]   reduces sympathetic autonomic arousal.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.240]   In other words, we feel calmer or we feel less alert,
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.400]   less stressed when moving our eyes from side to side,
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:47.160]   and the just so story about this is that
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.680]   these are the sorts of eye movements that we do
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.880]   when we are ambulating, moving through space,
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.080]   through some sort of self-generated motion,
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:58.080]   and one can make up a pretty reasonable story
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.080]   in the evolutionary context or ethological context
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:04.760]   that forward movement and fear
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.100]   are generally incompatible with one another,
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.500]   that generally a fear response
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.540]   involves a freezing or a retreating.
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:11.640]   Some people will advance,
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.540]   but that's usually a trained advance in response to fear,
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:16.040]   so first responders and so forth.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.600]   Most people freeze or retreat when they're afraid.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.640]   Forward movement generates these eye movements.
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.920]   It does seem to suppress activation of this threat reflex
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.720]   and the amygdala in particular.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.720]   So for the many EMDR practitioners out there,
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:35.400]   these papers, I think, are a great celebration,
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:39.520]   and I think there is now increasing excitement about EMDR
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.560]   in the psychiatric and psychological community
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.960]   for its utility for treating fear, trauma, and PTSD.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.880]   However, I should point out that in discussing EMDR
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.440]   with various colleagues of mine at Stanford and elsewhere,
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.080]   I was told that EMDR has been shown to be beneficial
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.300]   in particular for single event type traumas
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:01.960]   or fearful experiences,
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:05.720]   not so much for relieving the trauma
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.740]   or feelings of fear associated, for instance,
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:10.760]   with an entire bad marriage or an entire childhood,
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.800]   but more for single, more acute events
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.040]   that can be described within a very kind of brief narrative,
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:22.220]   brief not necessarily in time, but that the car accident,
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.800]   the bad interaction with another individual,
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.420]   the assault, God forbid, these sorts of things,
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:31.080]   and I realize we're down in the weeds of topics
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:35.020]   that are unpleasant, and so I have great sensitivity to that,
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:36.900]   but I think it's also important that we be realistic
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.080]   about the kinds of things that traumatize people.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:42.160]   So is EMDR useful?
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.240]   Well, it seems like it works for these single event
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.000]   or kind of constrained event type traumas
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.600]   that people can describe while moving their eyes
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.920]   from side to side, generally in the presence of a clinician.
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:58.540]   However, if we think back to the model of how you extinguish
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.880]   and then replace a trauma or fear,
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.580]   remember, you have to diminish the old experience,
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.600]   the amplitude of that, you need to,
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.800]   that's the extinguish portion,
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.760]   then you need to relearn a new narrative
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.760]   and attach reward to the old traumatic event.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:18.520]   EMDR only really taps into the extinction
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:23.400]   of the physiological response to the old experience.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.300]   I'm sure that there are EMDR practitioners out there
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.880]   that are thinking about the attaching
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.900]   of the new narrative and reward,
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:32.620]   but there I've heard less,
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:35.880]   and I've seen fewer peer-reviewed papers on that,
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.320]   so let's think about this logically.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.560]   Let's say, and indeed it's the case,
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.800]   that sitting down in a chair,
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.520]   moving eyes side to side deliberately
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.600]   for some period of time reduces activation
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.740]   of the threat reflex.
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:53.380]   I or the patient in this case recites or repeats
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:57.340]   over and over the traumatic event or the fearful event.
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:58.780]   I'm doing that in the presence
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:03.600]   of a lower amplitude response.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.480]   Remember back to where we talked about
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:09.240]   how the retelling works best
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.840]   if the first time it's done,
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:13.060]   there's a huge amplitude response,
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:15.260]   and then with each successive repeat,
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:18.520]   that response, the threat response gets lower and lower.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.480]   With EMDR, you're sort of short-circuiting.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.260]   You're kind of sneaking around the corner
[01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:24.120]   of that high-amplitude response,
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.680]   and so it's taking a somewhat different approach
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:30.700]   of trying to extinguish the bad feelings
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:34.340]   in body and mind associated with an experience
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:38.000]   by reducing the physiological response,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.280]   so it's somewhat different, and at least to my knowledge,
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.400]   and EMDR practitioners, please correct me,
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.880]   but at least to my knowledge,
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.200]   there isn't an active component to EMDR
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:52.260]   of relearning a new narrative and attaching reward.
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:55.080]   Now, reward and attaching reward
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:59.520]   requires a somewhat high-amplitude sympathetic arousal.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.560]   It requires a feeling of a victory, which is arousal.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.460]   It's positive arousal, not negative arousal,
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:06.680]   but it is arousal.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:08.840]   So I'm not focusing on this to try
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:11.400]   and diminish the potential impact of EMDR.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.920]   I know many people have achieved great relief from EMDR,
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.400]   but it doesn't tap into all the aspects
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.400]   of the extinction and relearning
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.680]   that we talked about previously,
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:24.600]   and therefore, I think on its own, at least in many cases,
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:29.280]   is unlikely to be a complete therapy for fear and trauma.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.200]   If there are people out there
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.340]   who've had terrific results with EMDR,
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.560]   please let us know in the comments section.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.420]   On YouTube would be the ideal place.
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:38.840]   If you've had bad experiences with EMDR
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.160]   or it didn't work for you, also let us know.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.120]   I think that EMDR practitioners,
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.320]   like most practitioners in the psychiatric
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.720]   and psychological space, are eager to expand their practices
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.160]   in order to make them more effective
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.280]   rather than clinging ardently to something
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:55.680]   that perhaps is incomplete
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.320]   or that doesn't work for certain individuals.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.020]   So I think they would appreciate that feedback, as would I.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.060]   So as I mentioned before,
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:02.840]   most of these therapies are done in conjunction
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:07.840]   with a skilled, often one would hope, credentialed clinician.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.140]   There are many people, however,
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.780]   that don't have access to that
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:15.160]   or who are working through stuff.
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.100]   They have things in their past
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.140]   that are very uncomfortable to them,
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:21.440]   and I'm aware that many people are working
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.280]   through those things through journaling,
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.840]   through talking to a friend,
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.220]   through any number of different
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:29.780]   sort of non-traditional approaches.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.400]   One thing that really pertains to everybody
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:36.600]   who's working through fear and trauma of any kind
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:38.920]   is the importance of social connection
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.520]   as it relates to the chemical systems
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.440]   and the neural circuits associated with fear and trauma.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.460]   And this is a emerging literature in neuroscience
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:48.940]   that is really a beautiful one
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:51.800]   because it's a very conserved biology.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.640]   We see it, believe it or not, in flies, in fruit flies,
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.680]   a commonly used model system,
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.880]   in mice and indeed in humans as well.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.800]   And this is the work of David Anderson's group at Caltech,
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:08.720]   of, again, of Dr. Ressler's group at Harvard Medical
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.500]   and elsewhere, of course.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:14.280]   And this is the work as it relates to tachykinin.
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:19.240]   Tachykinin is a very interesting molecule in our brain,
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:24.240]   and it turns out that tachykinin is activated in neurons
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.400]   of what's called the central amygdala
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.060]   and some nearby structures.
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:32.400]   So really smack dab within the middle of this threat reflex,
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.520]   very soon after some traumatic
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:39.040]   or fear-inducing event occurs.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:42.000]   And it actually sets in motion a number of other things,
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.760]   including changes in gene expression and potentiation,
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.280]   meaning long-term potentiation,
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:51.960]   activation of NMDA receptors and so on in the circuits
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:55.420]   that reinforce that fearful or traumatic experience.
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:57.220]   Now, what's interesting about tachykinin
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.680]   is also that it's been shown to lead
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.200]   to low to moderate levels of anxiety
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.320]   and even kind of aggression, irritability.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:11.240]   Tachykinin levels are further increased
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:13.640]   by social isolation.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.040]   And that social isolation is oftentimes
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.440]   what can exacerbate preexisting traumas or fearful events.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.680]   And in a kind of beautiful symmetry
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.320]   to that kind of dark and depressing story,
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:30.800]   social connection with people that we trust,
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.680]   and it doesn't have to be direct physical contact,
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:34.560]   but just social connection,
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:38.780]   conversing with, sharing a meal with,
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:41.200]   it could be physical touch if that's appropriate,
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:44.480]   those sorts of connections actually serve
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:48.940]   to reduce the effectiveness or even the levels of tachykinin.
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.000]   So the important point here is that
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.860]   trauma is traumatic in and of itself.
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:58.300]   Fearful events are hard in and of themselves.
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:16:59.700]   And if people are working through them
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:03.080]   either through clinical work or through individual work,
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.860]   it is important.
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:08.220]   And ideally one would still be trying
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:13.220]   to access social connection outside of that specific work
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:14.620]   related to the trauma.
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.980]   Now, it doesn't necessarily have to be outside of that.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.660]   For instance, if you have a good relationship
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:20.900]   with a clinician or therapist
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:22.660]   to the point where there's real trust
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:25.900]   and you feel a social connection with them, wonderful.
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:26.740]   But for many people,
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:29.820]   they have a more transactional relationship
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:34.080]   to the EMDR practitioner or to their therapist,
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:36.000]   or they're working through things on their own.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.360]   And it's really important to understand
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.900]   that regular social connection,
[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:43.940]   trusting social connection of any kind
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:46.300]   is going to be very beneficial for that process.
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:50.260]   And so this is not kind of just hand wavy, new agey stuff,
[01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:52.240]   like, oh, you know, you need social connection.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:56.440]   There's a actual neurochemical basis for social isolation
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.360]   that has an amplifying effect on fear and trauma.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.160]   And there is a neurochemical basis for the relief
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.980]   from fear and trauma and isolation.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:07.620]   And in the ideal circumstance,
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.820]   one is working through these traumas and fears
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:12.120]   very intensely in a very dedicated way,
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.940]   but then is also engaging in the sorts of social interactions
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:18.220]   that are going to diminish the amount of tachykinin
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:21.180]   and going to suppress those very circuits
[01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:23.280]   that would otherwise be amplified.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.580]   So next, I'd like to talk about some really interesting
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:29.680]   and almost kind of eerie scientific findings.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.680]   And that's the transgenerational passage of trauma
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.760]   or predisposition to fear and trauma.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.540]   This is a scientific literature that's been debated
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:43.400]   many times over the last really 50 plus years,
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.680]   but in more recent studies have really proven
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:51.980]   that we as humans have the capacity to inherit
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:56.020]   a predisposition to trauma or fear.
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:57.940]   Now that doesn't necessarily mean
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:01.540]   that we will become traumatized or experience extreme fear
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:04.640]   just because our parents or grandparents experienced that.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.680]   It's a predisposition, it's a bias.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:10.900]   Let me explain the papers that focus on this
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:12.200]   for a little bit, and then we'll talk about
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.440]   what this means for each of us.
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:17.100]   One of the most important papers in this area
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.620]   comes to us from someone I mentioned earlier,
[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:21.660]   Dr. Kerry Ressler at Harvard.
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:23.060]   And the title of the paper is
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:27.740]   Association of FKB5 Polymorphisms and Childhood Abuse
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.940]   with Risk of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:31.900]   Symptoms in Adults.
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:33.920]   And there are other papers as well.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.100]   Another one from the Ressler Lab,
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.780]   first author, Brian Dias, D-I-A-S,
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:42.460]   Parental Olfactory Experience Influences Behavior
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:44.840]   and Neural Structure in Subsequent Generations.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.280]   I'm going to summarize these papers and their general contour
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.800]   and papers related to them,
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.700]   although feel free to look up the papers I just described.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.740]   We will provide a link to them in the caption
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.120]   if you'd like to go further.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:57.780]   But basically these explorations involve
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:02.280]   looking at the histories of human individuals
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:08.300]   who had trauma or abuse of some kind in their childhood,
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:11.660]   and then looking at the likelihood of fear
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:15.540]   and PTSD type symptomology in their offspring.
[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:19.400]   And essentially what they identified is that indeed,
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.840]   if you had a parent,
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:24.100]   and there does seem to be a kind of a bias toward an effect
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:28.040]   where if the father had abuse
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:33.140]   and it's severe abuse or moderate abuse,
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:38.140]   that abuse causes a change in his genetics, in his sperm,
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:43.580]   that can be passed on to offspring,
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:46.740]   such that the offspring have a lower threshold
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:49.820]   to develop trauma or extreme fear
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:51.460]   to certain types of events.
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:55.460]   Now, what's important to point out is that predisposition
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:59.400]   or bias is not necessarily to the same sorts of events.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.180]   It's not that the abuse itself gets passed
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:05.260]   from one generation to the next, it's a predisposition.
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:09.100]   And the title of that paper mentioned FKB5,
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:12.820]   excuse me, FKBP5 polymorphisms,
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:17.820]   and the FKBP5 polymorphism maps to a location in the genome
[01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:22.160]   that's associated with the so-called glucocorticoid system
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.580]   with cortisol release.
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:27.700]   So the predisposition that one might inherit
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:29.820]   from having a parent, father or mother,
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:33.240]   but stronger tendency to inherit it from the father,
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.220]   who experienced abuse is one
[01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:38.660]   in which the glucocorticoid system, the cortisol system,
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:41.340]   and that HPA axis that we talked about before,
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:44.060]   the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:48.540]   is sensitized or reactive in a way
[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:52.060]   that sets a lower threshold to become traumatized
[01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:54.380]   or very afraid of certain types of events.
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:57.960]   But it's not unique to the specific type of abuse
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.460]   that the parent experienced.
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:02.180]   Now, this is really, really important
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:03.460]   because a lot of times out there,
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:06.140]   I will hear that there's passage
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.740]   or transgenerational passage of actual trauma,
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:09.900]   the specific trauma.
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:13.500]   Now, that could be through narrative telling.
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.580]   If somebody is exposed to a lot of narrative
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:19.600]   about their parents' trauma in one form or another,
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.740]   it may be that they start to internalize
[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:23.360]   some of that trauma.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.860]   And there could be, because we obviously can't rule it out,
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:28.540]   there could be some other signatures
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:31.840]   of prior specific traumas they get passed on to offspring.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.640]   But more likely, and certainly what these data
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:37.120]   about these polymorphisms point to,
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:40.780]   is that what gets passed on is a propensity
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:44.060]   for the threat reflex to get activated
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:47.540]   and attached to a wider variety
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:51.960]   or to less intense types of inputs and experiences.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.320]   And the important point to take away from this
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:58.800]   is that it's not some magical, mysterious,
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:01.480]   and mystical thing that's being transplanted
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:04.900]   from parent to child, it's a gene,
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:08.220]   or it's a modification in a set of genes
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:11.520]   that gives a heightened level of responsivity
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.260]   to fearful type events,
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:15.000]   or even a heightened level of responsivity
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.240]   such that things that wouldn't be fear-inducing
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.580]   or trauma-inducing to certain individuals
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:23.500]   can trigger fear and trauma in these children
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.980]   that inherit this particular gene.
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:29.020]   Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that they are fated
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.100]   to forever be traumatized or live in fear.
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.380]   That's simply not the case.
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:34.660]   It's just a genetic predisposition.
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:37.740]   Regardless of whether or not you had a parent or parents
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:39.740]   that were traumatized or not,
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:43.780]   there's no evidence, at least as far as I'm aware,
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:47.120]   that the treatments for trauma should be any different.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.540]   As far as I know, there aren't gene therapies
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:52.620]   currently aimed at these particular variants
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:55.900]   like FKBP5 and so forth
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:24:00.540]   that could reverse those particular genetic underpinnings
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:03.480]   of the trauma predisposition.
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:06.740]   So this transgenerational passage of trauma
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:09.700]   I think is extremely interesting in large part
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:11.540]   because it brings us back to this idea
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:16.540]   that the threat reflex is part of a larger sensory system.
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.160]   Normally we think of seeing as a sensory system
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:21.000]   or hearing as a sensory system,
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.600]   but the threat detection and threat learning system,
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:28.380]   the fear learning system is in many ways a sensory system.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:30.940]   It's just a sensory system that is very generic
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:31.780]   in its response.
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:33.420]   That generic response again is good
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:35.120]   because it allows for flexibility,
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:38.820]   but it's bad because it reduces specificity, right?
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:41.920]   We can essentially become fearful or traumatized by anything
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.380]   if the circuit gets activated
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:46.840]   and these particular children inherit a predisposition
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:50.420]   for more things and less intense things to traumatize them.
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:52.580]   In a few minutes, we are going to discuss
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:54.180]   some of the behavioral treatments,
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:56.880]   including some really new exciting protocols
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:59.420]   for dealing with fear and trauma.
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:01.140]   But for a few minutes,
[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:03.020]   I'd like to discuss some of the drug treatments
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:06.120]   that are starting to emerge as potential therapeutics,
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:08.500]   in particular for PTSD.
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.840]   The two drug treatments I'd like to focus on
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:13.580]   are ketamine assisted psychotherapy
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:17.380]   and MDMA assisted psychotherapy.
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:20.240]   Currently ketamine assisted psychotherapy is legal.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.080]   It is approved provided it is prescribed
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:26.300]   by a board certified physician in the United States.
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:29.900]   I'm not certain about other areas of the world.
[01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:34.400]   MDMA also sometimes called ecstasy therapy
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:37.060]   is in clinical trials in the US,
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:40.820]   it is still an illegal drug to possess or to sell.
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:43.180]   So I want to be very clear about that.
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:47.380]   However, MDMA is being explored as a potential therapeutic
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:50.520]   for PTSD and other forms of trauma.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:53.000]   And of course, ketamine and MDMA
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.200]   are also both being explored for chronic depression,
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.040]   eating disorders,
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:00.340]   and a number of other psychiatric disorders.
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:01.500]   But for the moment,
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:05.340]   I would just like to touch on ketamine and MDMA
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:09.620]   as they relate to the fear circuitry and trauma circuitry
[01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:13.000]   that we've described in the early part of the episode
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.020]   and throughout the episode,
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:17.600]   because I think that in viewing them through that lens,
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.220]   we can gain some additional insight
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:22.020]   into how they might be providing the sorts of relief
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:23.620]   that some of the early clinical studies
[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:24.980]   are starting to point to.
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:28.640]   Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.820]   That's right, it's a dissociative anesthetic.
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:35.360]   Its main function is to create a state of dissociation.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.200]   And I've never taken ketamine personally,
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:40.280]   so I can't describe the experience of it.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.020]   But a colleague of mine in psychiatry
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:47.980]   shared their experience with a patient's experience of it
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:51.500]   as making that patient feel as if quote,
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:56.180]   "They were getting out of the cockpit of a plane,
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:58.780]   but that they were observing themselves doing it."
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:26:59.740]   And this was, of course,
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:03.220]   during a approved therapeutic session
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:04.900]   that they were doing this.
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:07.900]   And they were in some sort of intense visualization
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:09.460]   about a traumatic experience.
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.500]   They were describing some of their depressive symptoms
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:12.860]   as well as the trauma.
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:16.580]   And the narrative that they basically created
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:17.940]   or took away from this,
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:19.340]   and that was relayed to me,
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:21.620]   was one in which the patient felt like
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:23.220]   they were in their own body,
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:26.200]   but they were also viewing their own body from the outside.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:29.220]   So dissociative, in other words.
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:31.140]   Again, I've never had this experience.
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:34.940]   Some of you may have with ketamine or through other means,
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:36.820]   but we might want to just take a moment
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:39.480]   and think about what ketamine actually does
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.100]   and what dissociation actually does
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:43.540]   at the level of neural circuits.
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:46.580]   And for that, we can look to this really beautiful paper
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:48.980]   that was published by my colleagues, Carl Deisseroth
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:52.300]   in psychiatry, Robert Malenka, also in psychiatry,
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.560]   Legion Low, also at Stanford.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.260]   They paired up or teamed up, rather,
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:00.460]   to explore how systemic ketamine
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:03.380]   adjusts circuitries in the brain.
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:05.540]   And what they discovered was that
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:08.100]   it changes the rhythm of cortical activity
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:11.140]   in certain layers of the cortex.
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:14.020]   The cortex is like a layered sandwich.
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:16.660]   The cortex, of course, being the outside of the brain.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:17.940]   And there was a particular rhythm,
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.420]   a one to three Hertz rhythm.
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:20.460]   One to three Hertz just means
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:23.420]   a particular frequency of electrical activity,
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:25.140]   in this case, in these layer five neurons
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:26.760]   of retrosplenial cortex.
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:30.260]   So you don't need to know much about retrosplenial cortex
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:32.320]   or one to three Hertz rhythms.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.760]   I think the important thing to just take away from this
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:39.100]   is that there is now starting to be an understanding
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:41.020]   of how drugs like ketamine work
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:44.460]   to create this subjective experience
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:47.220]   that this patient and other patients describe
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:48.520]   as dissociation.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:52.600]   You know, dissociation, in its essence,
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:57.040]   is really about not feeling what's happening.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.980]   It's about viewing what's happening
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:00.220]   from a different perspective
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:03.660]   than what normally one would view that experience from.
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:07.220]   And so if we kind of plug that general notion
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:10.540]   of dissociation and ketamine-induced dissociation
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:13.260]   into the circuit that we talked about before,
[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:15.680]   where we have this threat reflex involved in the amygdala,
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.580]   these outputs for freezing or for reward in the accumbens,
[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:20.740]   and we've got this prefrontal narrative
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:23.720]   coming down as top-down processing,
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:27.460]   it brings us right to that prefrontal cortical input
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:29.860]   to the threat system and that narrative.
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:32.240]   What seems to be the case in my review
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.420]   of the paper I just described,
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:38.680]   plus a review on how ketamine-assisted trauma relief
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:42.960]   might work, is that it somehow allows the patient,
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:46.100]   the individual, to recount their trauma
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:51.100]   while feeling either none or a very different set
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:54.020]   of emotional experiences that they experienced
[01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:57.020]   in the actual trauma or fearful experience.
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:30:00.620]   So it's a remapping of new onto old,
[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:03.160]   new meaning new feelings onto old feelings
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.100]   while staying in the exact same narrative.
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:07.160]   So it's a little bit like EMDR
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.220]   of suppressing the threat reflex,
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:13.340]   but it seems to bring in a replacement
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:16.500]   of previous emotional experiences
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:20.080]   and sensations in the body with new ones.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:22.960]   And so in that way, we can sort of view,
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.280]   or we can try and view ketamine-assisted psychotherapy
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:28.760]   for the treatment of trauma as bringing together
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:30.920]   the three elements that we talked about before.
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.320]   You want to diminish the intensity,
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:37.080]   the potency of the old original trauma experience
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.280]   or fear experience.
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:41.180]   So that seems to be accomplished through this dissociation
[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:43.240]   and maybe through the kind of anesthetic component.
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:45.580]   So it's a reduction in pain in the body,
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:48.520]   a dissociation, a kind of observing of the self.
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:52.200]   That leads to the extinction of the trauma and the fear.
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.920]   But then there also seems to be an automatic
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:58.320]   or kind of built-in relearning of a new narrative
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:30:59.720]   and new set of experiences,
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:02.860]   which is the next step that we described earlier.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:05.200]   So it's an intriguing therapy.
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.200]   It's one that's really catching on.
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.240]   And there are many, many clinics around the US
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:11.040]   that are now doing it.
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:14.220]   Whether or not it turns out to be the ultimate treatment
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:17.720]   for trauma and for fear isn't clear.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:21.400]   My colleagues in psychiatry tell me that that's unlikely,
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.300]   although it does seem to be beneficial
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:24.340]   for a number of people,
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:27.200]   especially people that are experiencing trauma
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:28.940]   or have existing traumas and fear
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:30.840]   that are coupled with depressive symptoms
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.320]   because the data on ketamine and depression
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.780]   seems to be quite strong.
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:37.300]   So now let's talk about MDMA.
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:41.140]   MDMA, also sometimes called ecstasy or molly
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:46.020]   in its recreational form, is a powerful synthetic drug
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:49.380]   that at least as far as we know,
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:51.980]   creates a state in the brain and body
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:54.620]   that is unlike any other chemical state
[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:56.980]   in the brain and body that's normally experienced.
[01:31:56.980 --> 01:31:58.220]   What do I mean by that?
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:01.100]   Well, we have several neuromodulator systems in our body.
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:03.900]   Neuromodulators are chemicals that change the likelihood
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:06.140]   that certain neural circuits will be active,
[01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:07.880]   meaning they can make it very likely
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.140]   that certain circuits will be active
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:10.460]   and make it very unlikely
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:12.780]   that other neural circuits will be active.
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:15.380]   Good examples of neuromodulators are dopamine,
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:18.380]   serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine.
[01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:20.420]   These tend to work on different systems
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:21.300]   in the brain and body,
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:24.620]   but they tend to be activated more or less in parallel.
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:27.240]   You can have dopamine released in your brain
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.940]   and also norepinephrine.
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:30.860]   You can have serotonin released in your brain
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:32.100]   and also acetylcholine.
[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:34.140]   So it's not an all or none kind of thing,
[01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:36.500]   but the degrees to which these things are activated
[01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:37.780]   tends to vary.
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:42.740]   And there is a little bit of a seesaw type phenomenon
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:44.260]   with dopamine and serotonin.
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:46.620]   Dopamine most commonly associated
[01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:49.700]   with activating neural circuits related to motivation,
[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:51.420]   craving, and reward.
[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:54.380]   And serotonin more typically activated
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:57.760]   in response to situations or conditions
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:00.200]   in which we are very happy and content with what we have.
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.460]   So dopamine is more about pursuing and seeking.
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:07.460]   Serotonin is more about kind of a pleasure and satisfaction
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:10.400]   with resources that we have in our immediate sphere.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:11.520]   They don't tend to,
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:13.960]   serotonin doesn't tend to place the brain and body
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:18.120]   into a mode of action quite as much as dopamine does,
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:19.000]   more or less.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.320]   MDMA is a unique compound
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:26.400]   in that it leads to very large increases
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.140]   in the amount of both dopamine and serotonin
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:31.780]   in the brain and body simultaneously.
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.400]   And that's a unique circumstance
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:38.120]   that is just simply not seen under normal conditions.
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:39.760]   From a subjective standpoint,
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:41.840]   people under the influence of MDMA
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:45.520]   in the therapeutic setting tend to report immense feelings
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:49.800]   of connection or resonance with people or even things,
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:52.240]   with music, with objects.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:55.760]   Certainly if it's being done in conjunction
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:58.360]   with a family member or a partner
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:59.680]   or with a therapist,
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:02.720]   they will feel extremely connected to that person.
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:06.300]   They'll feel a very close understanding and association
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:08.780]   oftentimes that goes beyond words.
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:10.840]   There is a chemical reason for that.
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:16.940]   It turns out that MDMA causes massive release of oxytocin,
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:21.140]   this neuropeptide that's associated with pair bonding
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:22.560]   and with bonding generally.
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.460]   The oxytocin system and the serotonin system
[01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:28.380]   are closely linked to one another in the brain and body.
[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:32.120]   And they tend to be co-released often at the same times
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:33.800]   and by the same sorts of events.
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:38.800]   So MDMA is one mechanism by which oxytocin is released
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:41.880]   in these massive amounts.
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:45.480]   And I should just relay some of the levels of oxytocin
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:47.000]   because they're really quite striking,
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.760]   gives a kind of a more vivid picture
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:53.020]   of why it is that MDMA would make people feel
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:55.720]   so associated in a positive way
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.600]   with the various things that are happening to them
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.840]   while they're under the influence of the drug.
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:02.840]   So the paper related to this that I'd like to highlight
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:06.540]   is in the journal, "Psycho Neuroendocrinology."
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:09.860]   The title of the paper is "Plasma Oxytocin Concentrations
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:14.220]   Following MDMA or Intranasal Oxytocin in Humans."
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:19.220]   And just remarkably MDMA increased plasma oxytocin levels
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:24.460]   to 83.7, this is an average,
[01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:27.800]   83.7 picograms per milliliter,
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:31.240]   about 90 to 120 minutes into the MDMA session
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:34.600]   compared to a typical level of 18.6.
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:37.160]   So this is a massive increase in oxytocin.
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.760]   And I think that massive increase in oxytocin
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.660]   is part of the reason why people have these feelings
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:46.600]   of close resonance and association.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:49.140]   Now, the dopamine increases
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:52.040]   are generally what lead to the feelings of euphoria
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.940]   inside of the MDMA session.
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:56.640]   And then the serotonin increases, it is thought,
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:59.160]   are what lead to the feelings of safety and comfort.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.380]   So again, a very unusual chemical cocktail
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:05.120]   that would never be seen, at least not at this amplitude,
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.180]   under any normal conditions
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:12.080]   outside of an MDMA clinical psychotherapeutic session.
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.780]   Why would this state of mind and body
[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:17.840]   be potentially useful for the treatment of trauma?
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:20.340]   Well, indeed it is revealing itself
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:22.160]   to be useful for the treatment of trauma.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.760]   Again, these are legal clinical trials
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:27.660]   where people are doing this and discovering this.
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:32.660]   What it seems to allow is a very fast relearning
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:37.100]   or new associations to be tacked on
[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:39.140]   to the previously traumatic experience.
[01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:41.600]   So again, it brings us back to the same model
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:45.200]   of how people extinguish fears and traumas
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.340]   and replace them with new experiences
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:49.380]   when there is no drug treatment involved.
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:53.120]   There needs to be a diminishing of the old experience,
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:54.140]   meaning an extinction,
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:55.920]   and then a relearning of a new narrative.
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:00.880]   What the chemical milieu of MDMA seems to be doing
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.360]   is creating an opportunity for all that to happen very fast
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:08.620]   without the need for many repetitions of the original trauma
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:11.060]   and reliving of the original trauma,
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.240]   probably because the reliving of it
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:17.400]   inside of one of these MDMA sessions is very acute,
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:22.400]   very intense, plus it seems to be offering the opportunity
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:26.960]   to extinguish and rewrite in or write in a new narrative
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:30.320]   associated with that trauma very quickly as well.
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:33.520]   So what this means is that treatments like MDMA
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:36.360]   that are under investigation in these clinical trials
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:41.120]   are unlikely to be magic potions, if you will,
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:45.220]   that allow access to a particular process
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:48.760]   that would otherwise not be accessible.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.980]   It's more that the typical process of trauma
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:53.560]   and fear reduction that's carried out
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.060]   in things like prolonged exposure,
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:57.440]   cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.240]   seems to be compacted into a much shorter session,
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:04.140]   and that session is performed at a much higher intensity,
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:07.240]   higher intensity because the chemical milieu of the brain
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:09.000]   is completely different.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.520]   I mean, the experience of MDMA
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:14.380]   is one in which people have a very heightened sense
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:16.900]   of euphoria, a very heightened sense of connection.
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:19.880]   So those positive experiences are essentially prime
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:22.800]   to be written in and over the traumatic experience.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:26.400]   And because of the high levels of serotonin in the system
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.120]   and probably oxytocin as well,
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:31.320]   there's a safety that's written into the situation
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:34.680]   that allows people to lean into perhaps narratives
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:35.880]   or components of narratives
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:38.500]   that they would otherwise be holding back from.
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:40.480]   So these are powerful compounds,
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:43.920]   and I think the future of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:48.480]   for trauma in particular is holding great promise.
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:51.040]   As of now, meaning at the time of the recording
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.480]   of this podcast, again, I want to reiterate
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:56.000]   that these are clinical trials that are being done legally.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.240]   These drugs are still illegal to possess or sell
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:01.640]   outside of clinical trials.
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:04.840]   Doing this sort of thing is punishable,
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:09.680]   but it does seem that the FDA and some of the related bodies
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:12.480]   that control these sorts of things
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.660]   are eyes open to this stuff.
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:16.740]   And I think it's very likely in the next few years,
[01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:20.400]   things like MDMA and certainly ketamine is already
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:22.680]   in widespread use within the psychiatric community.
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:25.020]   And I think we're going to be seeing a lot more of that.
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:27.580]   One thing we have not touched on yet
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:30.800]   is how do you know if you're traumatized?
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:35.220]   How do you know if you have chronic fear or a debilitating
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:36.720]   fear?
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:40.040]   Much of the psychiatric community focuses on
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:43.320]   how many other problems people might have,
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.520]   trouble sleeping, trouble eating,
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:51.080]   trouble maintaining quality work or schoolwork and so forth.
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:54.680]   And all of those are certainly very valid criteria,
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:56.920]   necessary criteria for determining whether or not
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:01.000]   somebody meets a clinical diagnosis or not.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.280]   But there's a biological component that I think we can all
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.160]   assess for ourselves.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:12.160]   And that's one of interoceptive versus exteroceptive balance.
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:13.200]   And that sounds confusing,
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:16.080]   but it's actually really easy to understand.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:21.080]   We can focus our perception on the external world events
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.920]   going on around us, beyond the confines of our skin,
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:26.220]   or within the confines of our skin.
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:29.020]   A focus and a perception on the external world
[01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:31.600]   is what's called exteroception.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:35.400]   And a focus on what's happening inside us is interoception.
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:39.780]   And we have the capacity to build mental appraisal
[01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:40.760]   into that, right?
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:41.620]   I can, for instance,
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:44.840]   stop for a moment and assess how my stomach feels,
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:47.620]   how hungry I feel, how quick my heart is beating.
[01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:49.460]   Some people, by the way, are much better at sensing
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:52.320]   whether or not their heart is beating at a particular rate
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:53.540]   and others not so much.
[01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:55.100]   Some people can actually count their heartbeats
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:58.540]   without having to take their pulse by placing pressure
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.540]   on their wrist or their neck.
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:01.660]   Some people can't.
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:02.500]   In other words,
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:04.620]   some people have very high interoceptive awareness
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:06.620]   and other people less so.
[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:09.500]   This whole business of fear and trauma
[01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:12.380]   relates to taking external experiences
[01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:17.180]   and funneling those experiences into this thing
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:21.040]   that I'm calling a threat reflex or the fear circuitry.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:24.580]   A recent paper published in the journal Science,
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:28.460]   so absolutely spectacular journal, Science, Nature, and Cell
[01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:31.420]   being the apex journals of scientific publishing,
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:36.040]   gets at this issue of where in our mind
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.620]   and how do we assess whether or not
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:42.820]   what we are feeling internally is reasonable
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:44.700]   given what's going on externally.
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:46.600]   And it's a really fascinating study.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:49.260]   I'm just going to highlight a little bit of it for you
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:52.300]   and then I'll touch on some of the relevant aspects
[01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:55.220]   and how that can be adopted into a practice
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:59.040]   to assess and reduce fear and anxiety.
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.800]   The title of this paper published just a few weeks ago
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:04.660]   in Science is Fear Balance is Maintained
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:08.760]   by Bodily Feedback to the Insular Cortex in Mice.
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.060]   We've not talked too much about the insula,
[01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:12.460]   also called the insular cortex.
[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:14.580]   This is a brain area that my lab has worked on
[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:16.300]   and other labs have worked on.
[01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:19.420]   It's a brain area that has within it
[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:24.360]   a map of our internal interoceptive landscape.
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:29.020]   It's a map of our internal bodily sensations.
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:31.580]   It's a really interesting structure.
[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:33.460]   So the way this study was carried out
[01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:36.440]   is that subjects were taught or conditioned
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:38.280]   to a particular danger signal
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:41.700]   through repeated presentation of a sound with a foot shock.
[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:43.380]   So there's a sound and there's a foot shock.
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:45.600]   And as you know from our earlier discussion
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:47.540]   about Pavlovian learning, conditioned stimuli
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:48.860]   and unconditioned stimuli,
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:53.120]   eventually the sound alone comes to evoke the fear response.
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:57.860]   And that's just classic classical conditioning.
[01:42:57.860 --> 01:42:59.900]   The insula is this brain area
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:02.620]   that's associated with determining
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:06.560]   whether or not one's internal sensations,
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:09.820]   gut, heart, lungs, et cetera,
[01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:14.020]   are reasonable or not given the external circumstances.
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:17.060]   It can even measure or is associated
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:19.100]   with our understanding of
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:20.900]   what are called atrial baroreceptors.
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:22.500]   These are blood pressure sensors.
[01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:25.700]   So believe it or not, when your pulse rate increases
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:27.500]   or you feel like you're stressed out,
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:30.140]   your atrial baroreceptors are sending a signal
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:32.660]   to your insular cortex and your insular cortex is saying,
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:35.420]   wow, I'm really stressed out, my blood pressure is up.
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:37.000]   You don't actually have to measure your blood pressure
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.420]   with a cuff, your insula is doing it for you.
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:41.500]   It's not getting a quantitative readout,
[01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:44.020]   but it's getting a qualitative readout.
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:47.300]   The main effect of inhibiting or reducing the activity
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:51.460]   of the insula was that the intensity
[01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:54.060]   of an outside world experience
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:59.060]   led to a range of different internal effects.
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:01.620]   In other words, for most people,
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:05.740]   a mild shock would induce a mild increase in heart rate,
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:07.420]   a mild increase in blood pressure,
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:10.340]   whereas an intense shock to the skin
[01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:12.020]   would lead to a big increase in heart rate
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:13.860]   and a big increase in blood pressure.
[01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:16.620]   Turns out the insula is important
[01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:20.560]   for establishing that match of intensity.
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:23.220]   And when the insula is inhibited,
[01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:26.600]   what ends up happening is that a mild shock
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:28.900]   can create a big increase in blood pressure
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:31.020]   and that can be maintained such that
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:32.580]   anything that's paired with that shock,
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:35.820]   like a bell or a tone
[01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:38.100]   would lead to a big increase in blood pressure.
[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:40.500]   You've probably seen examples of this in the real world.
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:41.900]   Maybe this is even you.
[01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:45.060]   Some people are very jumpy in response
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:47.380]   to just even small changes in their environment.
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:49.260]   So if somebody is working and you walk in
[01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:50.540]   and you say hello and they'll go, [gasps]
[01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:51.720]   and they're kind of, they're jumpy.
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:56.720]   They have a low threshold to a big anxiety or fear response.
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:58.460]   Other people are really calm.
[01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:01.140]   I recall my bulldog, unfortunately, he passed away,
[01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:02.560]   but before he passed away,
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:04.900]   if you walked in the room and you said,
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:08.980]   "Hey Costello, he might turn his eyes in your direction."
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:11.420]   He had a very high threshold to respond.
[01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:13.780]   He was pretty low anxiety animal.
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:15.300]   A lot of people are like that.
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:17.700]   You'd come up behind someone and you say, "Hello,"
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:20.260]   and they just turn around real slow
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:21.860]   or they might just turn around at normal speed and say,
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:24.660]   "Hello," whereas other people would jump out of their seat.
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:28.240]   The insula seems to be involved in calibrating how big
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:32.740]   or how high amplitude a given physiological response is.
[01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:35.940]   So it's pairing the internal landscape
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:37.580]   with the external world.
[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:40.140]   And this might seem like just a mechanistic
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:41.620]   but non-actionable point.
[01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:43.740]   But what you'll see from the next study
[01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:47.340]   that I'm going to describe is that recalibrating
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:49.920]   the relationship between outside events
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:53.580]   and internal responses, which is the job of the insula,
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:56.220]   is actually something that's under our control.
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:46:00.060]   And through a very simple, very short protocol,
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:03.780]   we can actually recalibrate that system so much so
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:08.020]   that we can potentially reduce the amount of fear and trauma
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:10.340]   that we experience in response to a memory
[01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:11.720]   or to a real event.
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:15.140]   And the entire process can occur very quickly.
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:17.820]   So I'm really excited to tell you about this next study
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:18.660]   for a number of reasons.
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:19.980]   First of all, it's extremely recent.
[01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:22.580]   Second of all, it's very well grounded
[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:25.400]   in our current understanding of the mechanisms
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:28.100]   of stress, trauma, and PTSD
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:31.100]   and unlearning of stress, trauma, and PTSD.
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:35.760]   And third, it points to a actionable protocol
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:39.140]   that while certainly is not the only approach
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:41.400]   that I think people could or should take
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:44.040]   for fear, trauma, and PTSD,
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.560]   is one that I think we are going to see implemented
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:50.260]   into the clinical setting very soon
[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:51.800]   if it's not happening already.
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:55.560]   Now, there's a fourth reason I'm very interested in it,
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:58.020]   which is that my lab works on stress, stress relief,
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:03.020]   and tools for managing sleep and improving focus, et cetera.
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:04.740]   And one of the hallmarks of the studies
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:06.740]   we've been doing lately
[01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:10.680]   is very brief five minute a day interventions
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.860]   of the sort that was used in this particular study,
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:15.600]   although I should emphasize I had nothing to do
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:16.860]   with this particular study.
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:18.560]   Now, this particular study was carried out
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:20.780]   in an animal model in mice.
[01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:24.180]   The work in my laboratory focuses on human subjects,
[01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:27.180]   but the similarities of the stress system,
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:29.540]   at least at the level that it was explored in this study,
[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:31.180]   I think have great relevance,
[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:34.500]   maybe even direct relevance to humans.
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:37.440]   So the title of this study is repeated exposure
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:39.280]   with short-term behavioral stress
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.040]   resolves preexisting stress-induced
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.880]   depressive-like behavior in mice.
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:45.520]   Again, this study was in mice.
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:50.000]   And basically what they did is they stressed out mice,
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.720]   got them depressed, and you actually can do that in a mouse,
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:55.320]   using a restraint protocol,
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.840]   and that's a long-lasting restraint protocol
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:59.400]   of 15 minutes or more.
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:00.360]   Mice don't like it.
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:01.740]   You do it often enough.
[01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:05.160]   They stop working so hard in their life,
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:09.000]   in their mouse life to gain food, to gain mates.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.860]   They show depressive symptoms at a number of levels.
[01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:12.300]   They show elevated glucocorticoids.
[01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:14.200]   You see the same thing in humans, okay?
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:18.280]   Chronic stress in humans lasting weeks or more
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:19.580]   does the same exact thing.
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:21.600]   So again, a very close match here
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:23.320]   in terms of mechanism overall.
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:27.040]   And then what they did was a very counterintuitive thing.
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:31.520]   Rather than give these animals stress relief
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:35.700]   at the level of reducing their anxiety with benzodiazepines
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:38.420]   or giving them a nice little mouse vacation
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:41.100]   or enriched environment,
[01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:43.060]   things that have been done in a lot of previous studies,
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:44.540]   what they did is they subjected them
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:47.740]   to five minutes a day of intense stress,
[01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:49.380]   but only five minutes a day.
[01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:52.740]   And what they found was miraculously,
[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:54.700]   but also very convincingly,
[01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:58.060]   daily short bouts of intense stress
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:02.900]   actually undid, reversed the effects of chronic stress.
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:05.180]   And it did this at the level of glucocorticoids,
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:06.760]   of hormones, of neurotransmitters,
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:08.720]   and a number of other different mechanisms.
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:11.880]   Now, I find this very exciting for a number of reasons,
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:14.520]   but in particular, because my laboratory
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.560]   in collaboration with David Spiegel's laboratory,
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.860]   our associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford,
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:22.660]   been exploring how five minute a day respiration protocols
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:24.240]   can alleviate stress.
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.800]   And while those data are not yet published,
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:28.020]   they are at the stage
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:29.580]   where I'm comfortable talking about them.
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:32.140]   And we are seeing some very impressive
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:34.580]   and significant effects on stress reduction,
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:37.360]   not just from respiration protocols
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.540]   that allow people to calm themselves,
[01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:42.180]   but also respiration protocols that bring people
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:45.460]   into a heightened state of autonomic sympathetic arousal,
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:47.120]   AKA stress.
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:50.500]   As my colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:53.740]   he's an MD, psychiatrist, and PhD,
[01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:58.740]   likes to say when it comes to trauma, anxiety, and PTSD,
[01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:01.980]   and the treatment of trauma, anxiety, and PTSD,
[01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:06.300]   it's not just the state that you are in or that you go into,
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:07.980]   it's how you got there,
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:10.840]   and whether or not you had anything to do with it.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:14.100]   And this brings us right back to those top-down mechanisms
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:17.340]   and the narrative around what we are experiencing internally.
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:20.340]   So let's zoom out and I'll explain how this works
[01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:21.880]   and what to do about it.
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:24.140]   We have this brain structure called the insula.
[01:50:24.140 --> 01:50:25.680]   We talked about the insula a few minutes ago.
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:29.120]   The insula is calibrating how we feel internally
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:31.260]   versus what's going on externally.
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:34.220]   It's involved in setting whether or not
[01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:37.920]   what we are feeling is appropriate given what's happening.
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:42.580]   We have a system that can generate threat responses.
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:45.700]   And in the case of trauma, PTSD, and extreme stress,
[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:47.940]   chronic stress, that system gets ramped up
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:50.220]   so that it takes very little, maybe even just a memory
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:53.800]   or maybe even an association that we're not even aware of,
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:56.220]   a location, trigger, something, we're not even aware of it,
[01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:59.220]   and we start experiencing that symptomology.
[01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:01.140]   How do we recalibrate the system?
[01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:03.480]   Well, most of the approaches that are out there
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:06.720]   involving drug treatments, typical drug treatments,
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:11.220]   would involve suppressing the level of internal arousal,
[01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:12.860]   just trying to bring that down.
[01:51:12.860 --> 01:51:14.860]   Now, some of those drug treatments work,
[01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:16.380]   but oftentimes they don't.
[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:18.340]   And if you think about it,
[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:20.380]   it's probably not surprising that they don't
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:24.980]   because by taking a drug that just lowers your anxiety
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:28.980]   overall, you're creating a different sort
[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:31.540]   of miscalibration of the system.
[01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:34.460]   So what we've been doing in human subjects
[01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:38.420]   is having them do either breathing protocols that calm them,
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:40.140]   and I'll explain what that is in a moment,
[01:51:40.140 --> 01:51:42.540]   or doing breathing protocols that increase their level
[01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:46.060]   of autonomic arousal and seeing how that impacts
[01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:48.860]   their response to stress overall, not just during
[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:50.480]   that particular breathing protocol.
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:52.980]   So the calming protocol that we use
[01:51:52.980 --> 01:51:55.100]   involves these physiological sighs.
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:57.420]   I've talked about these previously on the podcast
[01:51:57.420 --> 01:51:59.820]   and elsewhere, but if you just need a reminder,
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:01.080]   if you haven't heard about it,
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:03.160]   there's a pattern of breathing that we all do in sleep
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:04.960]   when our carbon dioxide levels in our bloodstream
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:07.880]   get too high, and we do this when we get claustrophobic,
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:09.060]   meaning we do it reflexively,
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:10.640]   and that's a double inhale through the nose
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:12.100]   followed by a long exhale.
[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:14.420]   So it's, [inhales and exhales]
[01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:16.420]   and yes, the inhales should be through the nose,
[01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:18.040]   and yes, the exhales should be done
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:19.180]   through the mouth, ideally.
[01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:20.820]   So it's a big filling of the lungs
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:24.320]   through two breaths, back-to-back inhales.
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:25.540]   [inhales and exhales]
[01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:27.020]   Even if you can only sneak in a little air
[01:52:27.020 --> 01:52:29.760]   on that second one, no talking if you're going to do it right
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:31.820]   and then a long exhale, which allows you to offload
[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:33.940]   a lot of carbon dioxide in the exhale.
[01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:37.660]   And we have people doing that in real time,
[01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:38.940]   anytime they experience stress,
[01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:41.080]   but the particular breathing protocol
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:43.300]   that we've been giving human subjects is for them
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:46.620]   to do the repeated, what we call cyclic sighing.
[01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:49.340]   So double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale,
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:51.700]   double inhale, exhale, repeatedly for five minutes,
[01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:53.420]   which is actually a pretty long time to repeat that,
[01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:54.840]   but you can do it pretty slowly.
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:57.700]   And people report and the data point to the fact
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:52:58.740]   that it's very calming.
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:01.060]   People feel more relaxed afterwards,
[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:02.980]   and that relaxation wicks out
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:05.440]   into other aspects of their life.
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:08.300]   Now, we did not look at stress and trauma in that condition.
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:09.720]   We also have another condition
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:12.180]   where people do what's called cyclic hyperventilation,
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:13.380]   which is very different
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:15.900]   and creates a very different internal state
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:18.960]   and is somewhat stressful.
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:21.180]   It's five minutes a day of stress,
[01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:23.820]   much like the study that I just described.
[01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:26.820]   And it involves basically doing this,
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:29.860]   what I'll do in a moment, for five minutes,
[01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:34.860]   which is hyperventilating, which is [breathing heavily]
[01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:38.820]   but not continuously for the five minutes
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:40.580]   because many people would pass out
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:42.300]   or feel extremely uncomfortable.
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:45.620]   It involves inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, very deep,
[01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:47.420]   inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth,
[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:49.700]   and then every 25 or 30 breaths or so,
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:52.360]   doing a full exhale and holding one's breath,
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:56.780]   lungs empty for about 25, maybe 30, maybe even 60 seconds,
[01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:00.000]   and then continuing until five minutes is up.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.340]   Subjects report and our data indicate
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:06.300]   that people feel a heightened level of autonomic arousal.
[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:07.820]   In fact, I can feel it right now
[01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:11.300]   even from that very brief cyclic hyperventilation bout
[01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:13.460]   I just did, you feel a heating up,
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:16.140]   you feel some people will perspire,
[01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:18.400]   some people get wide-eyed, some people feel agitated,
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:20.980]   that's adrenaline being released into your system.
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:23.180]   Now, I'm not suggesting everyone run out and do this,
[01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:25.260]   and if you have a predisposition to panic attack
[01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:27.080]   or anxiety attacks, please don't do this
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:28.860]   because it is very stimulating
[01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:31.080]   and can trigger those sorts of attacks.
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:34.740]   But this five minute a day protocol
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:36.360]   of cyclic hyperventilation
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:38.740]   does lead to big increases in autonomic arousal,
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:41.100]   so it's "stressful" in air quotes,
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:45.120]   but to bring us back to my colleague, David Spiegel's quote,
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:47.140]   it really was him that said it, not me,
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:48.920]   it's not just about the state that you're in,
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:51.900]   it's about the state that you're in plus how you got there
[01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:55.500]   and whether or not you directed entry into that state.
[01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:59.860]   And that point of that one directs their own entry
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:03.180]   into a state deliberately is really key,
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:06.880]   and I think has an important implications
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:09.180]   for whether or not there's stress relief
[01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:11.020]   and fear relief and trauma relief
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:12.960]   from bringing oneself into a state
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:14.560]   of increased autonomic arousal.
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:15.440]   Why?
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:18.480]   Because of the way that that fear
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:20.160]   and trauma circuitry is organized.
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:21.800]   If you recall, it's got these components
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:23.980]   of how external events can trigger
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:26.280]   an internal stress response and fear response
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:27.480]   and trauma response,
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:30.880]   but there's that top-down prefrontal component
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:34.600]   that can inhibit certain aspects
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:37.940]   of that fear and threat circuitry.
[01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:41.440]   Now, earlier, we were talking about that prefrontal circuit
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:43.940]   being engaged through narrative,
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:46.620]   through self-directed deliberate narrative.
[01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:49.980]   It's the person deliberately retelling the story.
[01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:53.400]   Here, we're talking about a deliberate reactivation
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:55.780]   of the sensations in the body.
[01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:58.100]   So where I think this is all going,
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:00.640]   meaning where my laboratory and the Spiegel Laboratory
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:03.400]   and other laboratories out there are taking this,
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:08.180]   is you can imagine a very brief five minutes a day,
[01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:09.960]   two weeks was the time that they did this
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:11.820]   for five minutes a day for two weeks,
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:14.140]   intervention in which people,
[01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:16.560]   with the support of a clinician, we would hope,
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:19.800]   would deliberately induce a physiological state
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:21.680]   that's very stressful, right?
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:23.560]   Not shying away from the stress response,
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:26.860]   but increasing their own stress response deliberately,
[01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:29.120]   and maybe in conjunction
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:33.320]   with recounting the traumatic or fearful circumstance.
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:34.960]   This is far and away different
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:36.760]   than the kind of state of mind and body
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:39.600]   that would come about in a ketamine-assisted,
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:41.360]   trauma-induced psychotherapy session,
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:45.920]   or a MDMA-assisted trauma psychotherapy session,
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:50.480]   or in a purely narrative-based psychotherapy session
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:53.500]   aimed at alleviating fear or trauma.
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:55.880]   The reason I like these sorts of interventions is that,
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:58.840]   A, they are very low cost or even zero cost, right?
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:02.920]   One could, you could imagine doing this while journaling
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:06.040]   or while recounting a particular experience.
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:07.360]   Again, they're very compact.
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:10.620]   Five minutes a day for two weeks
[01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:12.380]   is what was done in this particular mouse study.
[01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:14.100]   We don't know if that translates directly
[01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:15.520]   to the human study or not.
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:17.020]   What was interesting is that
[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:20.680]   if they used a longer daily bouts of stress,
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:21.940]   like 15 minutes a day,
[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:24.740]   that actually exacerbated the trauma
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:26.980]   and exacerbated the fear.
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:29.220]   So one has to be very careful.
[01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:32.480]   Stress and deliberate entry into stress
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:34.980]   and self-stressing are very potent tools.
[01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:38.100]   They're very sharp blades that it does appear,
[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:42.980]   or it's likely can help alleviate trauma and fear.
[01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:45.060]   But how long to do this,
[01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:46.580]   exactly what the protocol should be
[01:57:46.580 --> 01:57:49.460]   is still something that needs to be cultivated.
[01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:51.120]   I know there are going to be people out there
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:53.320]   that nonetheless are going to want to experiment
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:54.280]   with some of this.
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:57.620]   I will say that I do not think it matters
[01:57:57.620 --> 01:58:00.860]   how one gets into that stressed state,
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:03.600]   provided it is self-directed.
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:07.880]   And that therefore could be cold shower.
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:09.000]   It could be ice bath.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.320]   It could be anything that induces an acute,
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:16.360]   meaning a sudden onset of adrenaline,
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:17.720]   and is self-directed.
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:19.560]   That's really the key feature here.
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:21.720]   So I'm very excited about these data,
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:23.320]   both the five minute intervention data
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:24.560]   from the animal study,
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:26.440]   the work that's ongoing in my laboratory
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:27.960]   and Dr. Spiegel's laboratory,
[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:30.320]   and the work that's being done on the insula.
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:32.360]   Because I think what we're starting to see now
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:36.160]   is a picture of fear and trauma and PTSD
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:38.400]   that has this sensory component,
[01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:40.100]   what's happening in the world around us,
[01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:42.760]   this internal interoceptive component,
[01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:44.440]   how appropriate are the signals
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:45.560]   that are occurring in my body?
[01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:46.520]   I mean, let's face it.
[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:47.560]   If you almost get hit by a car
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:50.400]   and your heart rate is 140 beats per second,
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:51.860]   and that lasts for a little while
[01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:52.900]   and you're kind of stressed out
[01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:54.060]   and you don't get the best night's sleep,
[01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:55.020]   that's pretty normal.
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:56.780]   That means you have a healthy fear system.
[01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:59.780]   If that persists and you're dealing with a lot of issues
[01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:02.260]   a week later, six weeks later, two years later,
[01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:06.040]   then it's moved into the realm of trauma and PTSD.
[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:09.240]   So we need to always be taking into account
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:11.040]   the different components of the circuitry.
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:14.280]   I do think that deliberate self-directed entry
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:15.900]   into these short bouts of stress
[01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:17.440]   is a very promising approach.
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:20.160]   And it's one that if people are going to experiment,
[01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:22.380]   I just, again, want to caution people with anxiety
[01:59:22.380 --> 01:59:24.200]   or panic disorders, be very cautious,
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:25.340]   probably don't do it.
[01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:27.300]   Ideally, you would do this in conjunction
[01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:29.580]   with support from a clinician,
[01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:31.680]   but I'm also aware that there are a lot of people out there
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:33.120]   that are dealing with trauma
[01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:36.880]   and dealing with post-traumatic stress of various kinds,
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:38.440]   and that they're desperate
[01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:42.400]   for various self-directed intervention approaches.
[01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:44.600]   So just very briefly, I want to touch on some of the
[01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:47.120]   lifestyle and supplementation factors
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:50.240]   that can impact things like fear and trauma
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:53.040]   and getting over fear and trauma.
[01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:55.120]   To make a long story short,
[01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:58.420]   there are many things that we all can and should do
[01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:01.100]   to support our overall mental and physical health.
[02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:04.700]   And these are the foundational elements of quality nutrition,
[02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:08.900]   what that means to you, quality sleep on a regular basis,
[02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:10.440]   ample sleep on a regular basis.
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:13.360]   We have an episode on how to master sleep.
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:14.480]   In fact, we have four episodes
[02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:16.840]   that you can go to Hubermanlab.com or elsewhere
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:19.880]   and scroll down and you can find those episodes
[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:23.580]   in order to get your sleep really dialed in, as they say.
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:27.660]   If you're sleeping regularly and for sufficient duration,
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:30.860]   all of the systems of your fear circuitry
[02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:32.740]   are going to function better,
[02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:34.920]   mainly because the autonomic nervous system
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:36.920]   becomes very dysregulated
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:41.020]   when we are not getting good sleep on a regular basis.
[02:00:41.020 --> 02:00:45.660]   Dysregulated means that out of nowhere,
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:47.720]   we can have a higher propensity
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:49.720]   to have sympathetic activation
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:52.160]   or we can feel really tired and wired.
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:53.860]   That seesaw that I described earlier
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:54.940]   of alertness and calmness,
[02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:57.420]   of sympathetic and parasympathetic,
[02:00:57.420 --> 02:01:00.820]   in that analogy, we can imagine that seesaw has a hinge
[02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:04.240]   and that hinge can neither be too tight nor too loose.
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:05.080]   If it's too tight,
[02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:08.180]   you can get locked into chronic activation of alertness
[02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:09.700]   or chronic fatigue.
[02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:11.920]   If it's too loose, you're bouncing all over the place
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:13.620]   and you might be a little tired and wired one moment
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:16.500]   and then really hyper alert.
[02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:18.840]   Sleep resets that balance
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:21.700]   and resets that hinge to the appropriate tightness,
[02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:25.140]   if you will, so that all these circuits
[02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:27.520]   and not just the circuits related to fear,
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:29.980]   but also the circuits related to cognition, clear thinking,
[02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:33.820]   to be able to spell out very clear, detailed narratives,
[02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:35.340]   to feel like you are in control,
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:38.120]   you are deliberately bringing yourself into these protocols
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:39.380]   if that's what you intend to use.
[02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:41.180]   All of that functions much better
[02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:42.860]   when you're sleeping well and eating well.
[02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:44.460]   We talked about social connection.
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:48.760]   Those are all indirect supports of trauma relief
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:51.400]   and of getting over fear, but they are essential.
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:53.960]   I think of them sort of like the tide.
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:56.740]   When the tide is high enough, a boat can leave harbor.
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:58.920]   And if the tide is not high enough,
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:01.500]   then that boat is going to be stranded on shore.
[02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:02.940]   And in this analogy,
[02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:05.540]   the boat stranded on shore is your attempt
[02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:08.340]   or anybody's attempt to try and work through something.
[02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:10.140]   Very hard to do when we're sleep deprived,
[02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:13.140]   very hard to do when we're not fed enough
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:15.540]   or fed the proper foods for you.
[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:17.420]   And that's a highly individual thing.
[02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:19.900]   And social connection, as we talked about earlier,
[02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:21.940]   creates a general sense of support
[02:02:21.940 --> 02:02:23.980]   for the ability to move through things,
[02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:25.560]   but also chemical support
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:27.460]   at the level of suppressing tachykinin, okay?
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:29.560]   So those foundational elements are absolutely key,
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:31.180]   but they are indirect.
[02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:33.940]   I just want to briefly mention a few of the things
[02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:36.900]   that some people find great benefit from
[02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:38.480]   in the supplementation realm
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:44.280]   as it relates to anxiety, stress, fear, and PTSD.
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:45.800]   But I want to point out that, again,
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:48.440]   these are somewhat indirect in their support,
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:53.160]   and most of them focus on reducing anxiety overall.
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:54.680]   The two that I want to focus on
[02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:58.120]   are two that I've never talked about on this podcast before,
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:00.280]   because I've done podcasts before on stress
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:02.600]   and managing stress in the kind of shorter term.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:05.080]   So we've talked about Ashwagandha in a previous podcast.
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:08.000]   Check out the podcast on stress
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.080]   if you're interested in how that might be relevant
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:12.440]   as well as other tools.
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:15.620]   But the two are interesting ones.
[02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:18.480]   The first one is saffron, of all things,
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:21.560]   but there are 12 studies, believe it or not,
[02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:25.560]   that orally ingested saffron at 30 milligrams
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:28.720]   seems to be a reliable dose for reducing anxiety
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:30.380]   on the standard inventories,
[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:32.120]   the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale,
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:33.240]   for those of you that want to know.
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:34.680]   And these are significant effects,
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:37.640]   and these were carried out in both male and female subjects,
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:40.640]   always here I'm only referring to human studies.
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:42.480]   Several of these were double-blind studies.
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:46.400]   There's a meta-analysis of the positive effects,
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:49.240]   meaning anxiolytic effects,
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:53.240]   anxiety-reducing effects, that is, of things like saffron.
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:54.520]   Definitely have to check with your doctor,
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:55.480]   make sure it's right for you.
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:58.220]   But they're fairly impressive effects
[02:03:58.220 --> 02:03:59.760]   when you really think about it,
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:02.520]   given that these are legal over-the-counter substances.
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:04.100]   Again, check with a doctor.
[02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:07.000]   The other one is inositol.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.840]   Inositol has been shown to create
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:13.400]   a very notable decrease in anxiety symptoms.
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:15.540]   It's a fairly high dose that's used,
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:18.780]   but believe it or not, the potency of this effect
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:21.620]   is on par with many of the prescription antidepressants.
[02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:23.640]   That's pretty impressive.
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:25.920]   These studies, again, are double-blind studies
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:29.640]   that all showed decreases in anxiety.
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:31.860]   These were done in males and females.
[02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:33.760]   The age range is very broad, which is great,
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:38.280]   18 all the way up to 64 across the studies that I looked at.
[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:39.360]   One of the more important things
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.200]   is that the dosages are quite high,
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:45.560]   18 grams of inositol taken for a full month.
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:49.240]   And it does take some time for these symptoms of anxiety
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:52.200]   to be improved.
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:55.200]   The low dose range was about 12 grams of inositol,
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:58.920]   so as high as 18, as low as 12 grams.
[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:01.360]   But then again, pretty impressive results
[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:04.000]   considering that these are over-the-counter
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.520]   supplement compounds.
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:07.720]   There's even some evidence, I should just mention,
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:09.760]   that the inositol is also used for things
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:11.880]   like obsessive compulsive disorder.
[02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:14.600]   We will do a full episode on OCD in the future.
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:16.120]   You can count on that.
[02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:18.780]   But in the meantime, inositol does seem
[02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:22.520]   to have some positive effects on anxiety
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:24.280]   and therefore it might provide
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:27.360]   a kind of supportive indirect effect
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:31.300]   for people that are trying to work through trauma and PTSD.
[02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:32.820]   Now, the question is, when would you take it?
[02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:36.200]   Well, by the logic of what we spelled out today,
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:39.900]   you probably would not want to take it during a session
[02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:42.440]   or prior to a session where you were trying
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:45.080]   to amplify the intensity of an experience
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:47.020]   and the recounting of an experience
[02:05:47.020 --> 02:05:50.420]   in efforts to eventually extinguish that experience, right?
[02:05:50.420 --> 02:05:53.200]   Because if you put a drug or a compound of any kind,
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:56.200]   prescription drug or supplement of any kind,
[02:05:56.200 --> 02:06:00.420]   into your system, you are essentially short-circuiting
[02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:03.960]   the extinguishing effect, right?
[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:06.400]   So you can imagine doing this outside of that session
[02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:07.940]   as a way to kind of bring your system
[02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:09.800]   back to baseline, perhaps.
[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:11.240]   So if you're going to use these sorts of things,
[02:06:11.240 --> 02:06:12.800]   you want to think about them logically.
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:14.360]   And this also really points to the fact
[02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:16.360]   that many of the things that people are doing out there
[02:06:16.360 --> 02:06:19.760]   to self-medicate over use of alcohol or other substances
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:21.600]   to try and calm themselves because they have fear,
[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:25.880]   anxiety, and PTSD are actually driving that fear,
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:28.200]   anxiety, and PTSD deeper into their system,
[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:30.340]   or at least is not allowing it to relieve itself
[02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:33.280]   through any attempts to recount or replay
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:35.280]   in using these top-down narrative circuits
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:36.540]   or other approaches.
[02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:38.180]   And the last compound I want to mention
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:39.860]   is a particularly interesting one
[02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:42.280]   because it's neither an anxiolytic,
[02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:46.040]   nor is it something that increases overall levels
[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:47.480]   of stress and alertness,
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:52.480]   but it has some kind of MDMA-ish like contour to it.
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:55.960]   It does not produce, as far as we know,
[02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:59.880]   the same mental effects or physical effects as MDMA
[02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:02.600]   by any stretch, but that's the substance
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:04.820]   that I'm referring to rather is kava.
[02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:08.100]   Kava has been shown in eight studies
[02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:11.680]   to have a very potent effect on reducing anxiety.
[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:15.560]   But what's interesting about kava is that kava functions
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:17.120]   by increasing GABA,
[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:19.000]   this inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.920]   Remember, GABA is the inhibitory neurotransmitter
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:24.840]   that is used, that's employed by the very neurons
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:28.160]   in the prefrontal cortex that serve to inhibit
[02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:30.980]   the threat reflex.
[02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:32.880]   So it seems to increase GABA,
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:35.480]   but it also increases dopamine.
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:37.920]   And that's a somewhat unusual compound.
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:39.200]   I'm not aware of many compounds
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:42.480]   that simultaneously increase GABA and increase dopamine.
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:44.960]   And as you recall, that threat reflex has outputs
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:47.160]   that tap into the dopamine system.
[02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:50.640]   Now that's a big leap to go from a compound
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:52.000]   that increases GABA and dopamine
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.920]   and look at a circuit spelled out on paper in front of us
[02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:57.140]   and say, oh, well, there's GABA and dopamine in the circuit
[02:07:57.140 --> 02:07:59.260]   and therefore this is a good compound to take.
[02:07:59.260 --> 02:08:02.340]   But the effects of kava in human studies
[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:06.220]   are pretty interesting as it relates to anxiety,
[02:08:06.220 --> 02:08:08.200]   stress, PTSD, and fear.
[02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:10.300]   I'm not going to summarize all of these
[02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:13.520]   because there are eight studies that I'm aware of,
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:14.480]   but I'll just mention again,
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:15.720]   these are double blind studies.
[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:17.220]   So the trial design is solid.
[02:08:17.220 --> 02:08:20.120]   The age ranges are anywhere from 18 to 64,
[02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:21.640]   which is a nice broad age range.
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:25.960]   The number of subjects is quite high, both men and women.
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:31.920]   No signs of hepatotoxic signals, so meaning liver toxicity,
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:34.300]   although of course check with your doctor.
[02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:36.840]   But what was interesting is that after a period
[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:38.840]   of about three weeks of treatment
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:42.380]   with anywhere from 150 milligrams
[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:46.660]   of what are called active kava lactones, okay?
[02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:49.120]   So there are dosages that relate to that kava.
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:51.260]   So 100 milligrams of extract of kava
[02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:53.940]   is a kind of a reasonable typical dose in these studies,
[02:08:53.940 --> 02:08:58.260]   but that spells out to a certain amount of kava lactone.
[02:08:58.260 --> 02:09:00.380]   So you have to kind of boil down
[02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:03.100]   to what is the appropriate dosage.
[02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:04.940]   And it turns out it's extremely broad.
[02:09:04.940 --> 02:09:06.580]   You'll see evidence of 50 milligrams.
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:08.140]   You'll see evidence of 300 milligrams.
[02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:09.740]   It's kind of all over the place.
[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:12.740]   But each of these studies alone and together
[02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:15.740]   point to the fact that kava does seem to produce
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:20.740]   a very potent anxiolytic and general kind of improvement
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:26.040]   in depressive symptoms and reduction in generalized anxiety
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:26.880]   across the board.
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:28.180]   So it's an interesting compound.
[02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:30.280]   I've never actually tried any of the compounds
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:35.280]   I just mentioned, kava, saffron, or anisotol.
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:37.760]   So I can't report on them personally.
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:40.720]   I just know that a number of listeners of this podcast
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:42.460]   are interested in supplements
[02:09:42.460 --> 02:09:44.820]   and legal over-the-counter approaches
[02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:46.760]   to their biology and psychology.
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:48.220]   And so that's why I mentioned them.
[02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:49.660]   Those were the three for which I found
[02:09:49.660 --> 02:09:51.120]   the most convincing evidence.
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:53.180]   And the largest bulk of evidence.
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:54.780]   So if you're interested in exploring those,
[02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:58.620]   proceed with caution, but they do seem quite interesting.
[02:09:58.620 --> 02:10:01.260]   So today we've reviewed a large amount of information
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:05.020]   about the biology of pathways in the brain and body
[02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:06.740]   that underlie the fear response
[02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:09.460]   and that give rise to chronic fear
[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:12.060]   and in some cases to trauma and PTSD.
[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:16.100]   We also touched on a large variety of approaches
[02:10:16.100 --> 02:10:19.600]   to dealing with fear, trauma, and PTSD
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:23.940]   that currently exist in the clinical landscape out there.
[02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:26.120]   I also touched on some of the emerging themes.
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:28.560]   For instance, this short five minute a day,
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:32.620]   deliberate self-directed stress of any kind
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:34.620]   through respiration or other approaches
[02:10:34.620 --> 02:10:37.500]   of increasing adrenaline as an approach
[02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:40.740]   that might be viable, I should emphasize might be viable
[02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:45.740]   for enhancing the speed or the potency of treatments
[02:10:46.180 --> 02:10:49.780]   to reduce fear or eliminate trauma.
[02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:52.240]   Most important I believe is to understand
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:54.440]   and really think about the logical structure
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:57.620]   of the circuits that underlie fear and PTSD.
[02:10:57.620 --> 02:11:01.020]   Because in doing that, each of us, all of us,
[02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:02.600]   can think about what sorts of treatments
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:05.140]   and approaches make the most sense for them.
[02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:07.220]   I also hope that it will help people lean
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:11.940]   into certain practices involving re-exposure,
[02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:13.960]   provided that's done in a supportive environment,
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:16.540]   re-exposure to a given traumatic event
[02:11:16.540 --> 02:11:18.560]   in an attempt to extinguish that.
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:20.200]   Obviously you want to do that safely,
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:22.960]   meaning psychologically safely and physically safely.
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:25.480]   There are great practitioners out there
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:27.980]   that can help you with that work.
[02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:29.540]   There are also a number of people out there,
[02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:32.900]   I am certain, that are carrying certain traumas
[02:11:32.900 --> 02:11:35.220]   or certain fears that they would like to alleviate
[02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:38.260]   that are not in the extreme clinical realm.
[02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:40.660]   And that's the reason why I touched on a number of things,
[02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:42.600]   including some self-directed practices
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:46.240]   that might be useful and reasonable for them to explore.

[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:22.760]   We also have a Patreon, it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,

[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:26.440]   at any level that you like.
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:27.840]   On this podcast episode
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:29.840]   and in many previous podcast episodes,
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:31.420]   I describe supplements.
[02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:33.260]   While supplements aren't necessary
[02:12:33.260 --> 02:12:35.080]   and perhaps aren't right for everybody,
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.600]   many people derive great benefit from supplements.
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:39.080]   It is important, however,
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:40.320]   that if you're going to use supplements
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:41.980]   that they be a very high quality
[02:12:41.980 --> 02:12:44.560]   and that you can trust that the amounts of supplement
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:45.980]   listed on the supplement bottle
[02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:47.760]   are actually what's contained in the bottle.
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:50.400]   It's a serious issue with a lot of supplements out there.
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:53.280]   For that reason, we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-I-N-E,
[02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:55.640]   because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:57.900]   with respect to the quality of their supplements
[02:12:57.900 --> 02:13:00.660]   and the amounts of the supplements listed on the bottle
[02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:02.740]   are actually what are contained in the bottle.
[02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:04.660]   They've partnered with all the major sports teams
[02:13:04.660 --> 02:13:06.000]   as well as the Mayo Clinic,
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.800]   so we have a very high degree of trust with Thorne products.
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:10.580]   If you want to see the Thorne products that I take,
[02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:15.580]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman,
[02:13:15.580 --> 02:13:18.040]   and there you can see the supplements that I take.
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:20.280]   You can get 20% off any of those supplements,
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:22.920]   and if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site
[02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:26.580]   through that portal, thorne.com/u/huberman,
[02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:29.640]   you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:30.760]   that Thorne makes.
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:32.960]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:34.740]   on Twitter and Instagram,
[02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:37.040]   there I do short neuroscience tutorials.
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:38.320]   I offer a lot of tools.
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:39.920]   Oftentimes that don't overlap
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:41.720]   with the content of the podcast.
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:43.360]   And last but not least,
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:45.200]   thank you for your interest in science.
