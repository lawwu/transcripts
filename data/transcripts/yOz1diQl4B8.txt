[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520]   Case from Dripping Springs, Texas asks, "What does it mean that teachers will be
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.520]   judged with greater strictness?" (James 3:1) "When you say the teachers will be held
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.400]   more responsible than others for teaching what is fully biblical, what
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.960]   does that really mean in light of the fact that the believer is justified by
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.820]   faith alone?" Another way to ask it is, "What will be the ramifications for the
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.200]   Christian teacher who accidentally preaches some form of falsehood?" Let's
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.480]   get the text in front of us here. It's James 3.1. "Not many of you should become
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:43.000]   teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach," then the ESV translates,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.360]   "will be judged with greater strictness." Literally, it's knowing that we will
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.040]   receive the greater judgment. So evidently, the implication is, if you
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.740]   teach and you stumble, because the next word says we all stumble in many ways,
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.160]   that is, you stumble in teaching either in some unholy way, you use language
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.000]   that's an unholy way, or you teach some error, then for you the judgment is going
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.120]   to be stricter. Now what's going on there? I think the principles
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.560]   that are being assumed there go something like this. Number one, knowing
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.640]   what to do makes one accountable to do it. Romans 1.20. His invisible attributes,
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.440]   namely his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived ever
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.160]   since creation of the world in the things that have been made, so they are
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.600]   without excuse. So the principle there is, well, you would have an excuse at the
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.360]   judgment day if the invisible attributes of God compelling you to worship were
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.080]   not known by you. So the principle behind the greater judgment or the judgment is
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.360]   you will be called a judge, judgment, because you knew what you should do, and
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.680]   the assumption is teachers, by teaching, are claiming to know what they ought to
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.000]   do, and therefore they have greater judgment if they fall short. Here's
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.160]   principle number two, knowing more makes one more accountable. So the failure to
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.440]   speak wisely when we know more will receive a greater judgment. So this is
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.440]   Luke 12.47. The servant who knew his master's will but did not get ready or
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.760]   act according to his will will receive a severe beating, and the one who did not
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.600]   know did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating. And here comes
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.840]   the principle. Everyone to whom much is given, of him much will be required, and
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.760]   from him to whom they entrusted much they will demand the more. So behind this
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.280]   statement about teaching being judged with greater judgment is teachers--I'm
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.160]   just thinking of myself here--I probably study the Bible more than any of my
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.840]   people. So I'm being given much. I know much, I feel much, and I'm responsible to
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.880]   say much, and therefore the likelihood that I will not live up to this much or
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.600]   teach faithfully this much is very great, and therefore my judgment will be
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.520]   greater. That's principle number two. Now applied to teaching
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:50.120]   explicitly, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 3, if anyone builds on the
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.360]   foundation with gold, silver, precious stones--that's building on the foundation
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.880]   of Christ with good teaching--or he might build with wood, hay, and straw, each one's
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.880]   work will become manifest, for the day will disclose it, and it will be revealed
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.280]   by fire. Fire will test what sort of work each one has done. If the work that
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.800]   anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. If
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:27.320]   anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.920]   saved, but only as through fire. So the picture there is, teachers can build
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.640]   with wood, hay, and stubble, teachers can build with silver, gold, and precious
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.520]   stone, and the one will be burned up and the other will be preserved for his
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.560]   reward, and the more you know, the more you will be held accountable, and the
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:58.240]   more you blow it, given that knowledge, the more you will suffer loss. Now those
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.800]   are the principles. What this person seems to be asking is, "Okay, I hear you
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.160]   saying that, but I thought we were justified by faith. I thought from work, though. You
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.680]   seem to be saying that judgment is according to some kind of works." And the
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.840]   answer to that is that justification by faith alone and judgment according to
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.480]   works are not contradictory. They're both taught in the New Testament.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.280]   Justification on the basis of faith alone means that we trust Christ alone,
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.360]   and God views us in our union with Christ through faith as having Christ's
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.880]   perfect righteousness, and thus accepts us into his just and holy favor, and then
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:52.600]   we are, according to Ephesians 8-10, saved for good works. And the function of those
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:59.560]   good works is not to earn our acceptance or our eternal life, but to demonstrate
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.360]   our acceptance and our newness and our faith and our life that we have within
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.080]   us. I think, Tony, one of the best illustrations that I've seen in the
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.240]   Bible that I've ever come up with to help me distinguish between how works
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.520]   show that we're justified or born again or have true faith and how they produce
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:29.480]   it is the time when the two prostitutes came with the living baby to Solomon and
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.200]   said--both of them said, "This is my baby! This is my baby!" We both had a baby, and
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:40.600]   one of them said, "She killed my baby, and then she stole my baby!"
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.720]   And, "I want my baby back!" And Solomon doesn't know which is the true mother
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.840]   here, and so he comes up with this wise statement. He says, "Okay, let's cut the
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.880]   baby in half, and each of you can have half the baby." And the true mother says,
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.920]   "Don't kill the baby! She can have the baby!" And the other mother says, "That's fine." And
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.560]   Solomon says, "Okay, now we know who the mother is." Now, when that woman said, "Don't
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.840]   kill the baby," that didn't make her the mother. It just showed she was the mother.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.840]   That's the difference between a work revealing our new birth and our
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.280]   justification and a work causing. She didn't become the mother by saying, "This
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:32.920]   is my baby." She just proved she was the mother by saying, "This is my baby." So we
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:38.240]   have to go to the New Testament and let the judgment according to works stand.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.680]   Romans 14, 12, "Each of us will give an account of himself to God." Second
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.720]   Corinthians 5, 10, "We must appear before the judgment seat of Christ so that each
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.480]   one may receive what is due for what he's done in the body, whether good or
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:59.040]   evil." Or Ephesians 6, 8, "Knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.960]   back from the Lord." There's a correlation between the rewards that we will have in
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:12.640]   the age to come and the fruit of our faith here called good deeds. And that
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.560]   doesn't mean that our justification or our acceptance is based upon our works.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:25.160]   It simply means that these works are displaying our trust in God for our
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:32.080]   justification, and as displays, they are fitting us to have greater or lesser joy
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:38.080]   in the presence of God forever. Amen. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for
