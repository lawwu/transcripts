[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   If you were made CEO of Google+, could you have made it work?
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.280]   The problem is there was no CEO of Google+.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.360]   It was just like a division within a company.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.240]   And you asked before about what are the kind of scarcest commodities,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.080]   but you asked about it in terms of dollars.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.680]   I actually think for most companies, of this scale at least, it's focus, right?
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.560]   It's like when you're a startup, maybe you're more constrained on capital.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.720]   You know, you just are working on one idea and you might not have all the resources.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.040]   I think you cross some threshold at some point where you're building multiple things and you're
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.760]   creating more value across them, but you become more constrained on what can you direct.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.520]   There's always the cases where something just
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.440]   random awesome happens in the organization.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.480]   I don't even know about it.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.600]   And that's great.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.800]   But I think in general, the organization's capacity is largely limited by what the CEO
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.120]   and the management team are able to kind of oversee and kind of manage.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.600]   I think that that's just been a big focus for us.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.560]   As I guess Ben Horowitz says, "Keep the main thing the main thing."
