[00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.360]   - Wow, that was a great lunch.
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.420]   Welcome back.
[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.440]   This is the session where everybody stops breathing.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.280]   All right.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.560]   I'll never forget doing this particular session
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.120]   at a conference up in Central Ohio,
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.480]   and we had about 200 or 300 people there.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.060]   And I said, now on the last session,
[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.060]   we're gonna talk about the biblical view of sexuality.
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.800]   And then I'm gonna open it up for questions.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.440]   So I talked about it, and during the whole time,
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.920]   people just kind of sat there looking straight ahead.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.280]   All right.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.220]   And at the end, I said, are there any questions?
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.040]   And everybody just sat there.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.220]   Nobody moved.
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.320]   They were afraid to move.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.160]   All right.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.160]   And pretty soon, there was one guy about halfway back
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.940]   on the left-hand side that just kind of slowly,
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.640]   little bald-head guy, slowly put his hand up like this.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.440]   And I said, finally, we got a brave person
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.920]   to ask a question.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.880]   So what's your question?
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.720]   I said, now stand up so everybody can hear you.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.920]   He didn't wanna do that.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.320]   So he stood up, and he said, well,
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.980]   we have this friend, and the whole place lost it.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.720]   Yeah, right.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.920]   His wife turned all shades of red.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.320]   They felt like crawling underneath the pew.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.640]   But he went ahead and asked the question.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.680]   I answered the question, and then the dam broke,
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.560]   and then we were there for the next two hours
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.760]   just answering questions about this.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.800]   So this is a very important topic.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.740]   Now, before we get into it, pop quiz.
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.640]   Gentlemen, you're gonna impress the ladies again.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.760]   Three things you need to remember
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.400]   in order to be a godly husband.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.560]   I know you had caffeine for lunch, so you can do this.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.520]   All right, here we go.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.080]   Number one, in order to be a godly husband,
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.240]   you've gotta be a, huh?
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.680]   Yeah?
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.800]   Yes, exactly, yay.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.600]   Give the guys a hand.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.400]   That's great, all right, wonderful, wonderful.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.840]   All right, ladies, you're gonna put a smile
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.840]   on your husband's face by describing three things
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.520]   you need to remember in order to be a godly wife,
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.680]   and you've gotta say it right out loud,
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.640]   and they all start with S, remember?
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.080]   Remember, a little bit more sophisticated than the guys,
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.520]   but you gals got it, I know you do.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.240]   Ready, in order to be a godly husband,
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.360]   I have to practice, uh-huh?
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.580]   Yeah?
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.940]   There we go, and selflessly reverent.
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.780]   Submission suitable, helper, selfless.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.500]   Gentlemen, give your wives a hand, okay?
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.340]   Good.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.220]   All right, four rules of communication.
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.340]   Four rules of communication.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.500]   We're gonna go home and start practicing these right away.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.780]   Even the kids, we're bringing the kids in on this, too.
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.180]   Four rules of communication that are really vital
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.300]   for us to understand.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.700]   Number one, be?
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.540]   - Honest.
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.940]   - Number two, keep?
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.780]   - Current.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.260]   - Number three, attack?
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.100]   - Fight.
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.140]   - That's right, number four, act?
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.460]   - React.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.940]   - That's right, number four, act, don't react.
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.620]   Be honest, keep current, attack the problem,
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.620]   not the person, act, don't react.
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.740]   Now, we wanna talk about the sexual relationship
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.900]   and the marital relation, in marriage,
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.900]   and so if you have your notes there,
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.880]   just grab it and pull 'em out,
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.100]   and we wanna talk about six main principles
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.860]   that will help you to understand
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.980]   what does the Bible say about this.
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.040]   Most couples that I talk to,
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.780]   nobody's ever explained this to them,
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.560]   they've never heard this addressed in church,
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.220]   and nobody's ever sat down and discipled them,
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.780]   not even in premarital counseling
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.180]   was this really handled very much,
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.460]   even if they did have premarital counseling,
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.260]   and a lot of couples don't get premarital counseling.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.160]   So, what does the Bible really say
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.660]   about the sexual relationship in marriage?
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.420]   This is important, and I want you to, in a sense,
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.380]   grab a hold of this and hold onto this.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.220]   Now, when we're dealing with this,
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.960]   there is a whole spectrum of views
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.220]   out there in Christianity,
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.140]   and they run from one side of the spectrum
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.420]   to the other side of the spectrum,
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.260]   let me see if I can illustrate that for you
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.700]   just a little bit.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.740]   There is a Victorian approach to union and marriage
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.580]   that basically says that sex is sin,
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.120]   it's a nasty topic, it's dirty,
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.020]   don't talk about it, you shouldn't talk about it,
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.820]   and there are a lot of people who are raised that way,
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.860]   raised in Christian homes,
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.680]   mom and dad didn't really say a whole lot about it,
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.000]   until the gals reach an age where they went through
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.740]   a time, menstrual changes that go on in their body,
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.420]   nobody has said anything about it, or very little,
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.220]   and there are some Christian homes that function like that.
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.700]   On the other side of things,
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.660]   there are other homes that are sort of postmodern view,
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.480]   which is sex is the highest of all human relationship,
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.300]   and it's what makes a good marriage,
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.300]   if you're not having great sex,
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.300]   then there's something seriously wrong with your marriage.
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.860]   So you've got this one view on this one side
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.240]   that basically says it's a sinful thing,
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.620]   it's a dirty topic, you don't want to talk about it,
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.180]   and then you've got this other view in Christianity,
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.460]   clear over here, that says, oh no, it's just the opposite,
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.620]   it's a wonderful thing,
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.220]   and if you're not having great sex in marriage,
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.060]   that is an indicator that you have serious problems
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.940]   in your marriage.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.700]   Well, and then there are various views
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.400]   in between those particular views that you can highlight.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.540]   So what does the Bible say?
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.620]   I mean, if the Bible genuinely is our guide,
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.060]   and the Bible's supposed to be our guide, right?
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.780]   What does the Bible really say?
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.680]   What does the Bible teach about this subject?
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.500]   I mean, if it's such an important topic,
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.020]   and I don't think there's any Christian
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.540]   that would not say that it's an important topic, it is,
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.540]   so what does the Bible really, really genuinely say about it?
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.300]   So, let's take a look at this.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.980]   Now, remember what we said
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.760]   at the very beginning of our conference,
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.980]   and that was Romans 12, verse nine,
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.980]   let love be genuine, abhor or hate that which is evil,
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.460]   and cling to that which is good, right?
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.020]   So, at the end of this marriage conference,
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.060]   and people ask you, what did you do this weekend?
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.700]   I went to a marriage conference,
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.520]   and I learned how to hate more.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.720]   What?
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.140]   I learned how to hate my own sin more.
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.140]   So if I am sinning in the sexual area
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.500]   of the marital relationship,
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.500]   I have to turn all of my negative emotions on that.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.900]   I've gotta learn to hate that sin,
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.140]   if that's what I'm doing.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.100]   Otherwise, I'm not really changing,
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.020]   and I'm not really growing, just as Pastor just said,
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.420]   reminded us, that's part of the progressive sanctification
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.780]   of the believer, in terms of changing and growing,
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.580]   I want to be more like Christ.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.860]   Help me to be more like Christ,
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.920]   even in the sexual area in my marriage.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   Now, I know some of you are probably going,
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.940]   what does Jesus have to do with that?
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.500]   All right, everything.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.700]   He has everything to do with this.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.300]   So if you violate God's word in the sexual realm,
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.220]   then you've gotta learn to hate that violation.
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.620]   I've gotta hate it, and I've gotta change.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.840]   I want to be more like Christ in this area.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.820]   So let's take a look at this.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.660]   Now, let's go back, and let's go back
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.820]   to where we began our conference.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.800]   This is a good way to start this last session.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.380]   Back to Genesis chapter one,
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.380]   and we'll fall in here in verse 27.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.460]   So, God created man in his own image.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.900]   In the image of God, he created him.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.220]   Male and female, he created them.
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.040]   So Adam was created fully and completely male.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.340]   Eve was created fully and completely female.
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.200]   All of that is true, and then later on,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   in verse 31, God calls everything he had created very good.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.420]   So, the sexual relationship and the way
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.740]   in which you were created in your body is a good thing.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.180]   Now, I realize we have a lot of problems
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.460]   in our culture with the transgender type of people
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.140]   who struggle with their identity.
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.940]   They struggle with who they are,
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.100]   and it's only culture that has done that to them.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.140]   You understand that?
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.980]   That's what culture has done,
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.260]   and basically, they can become discontent
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.640]   if they have a woman's body, or if they have a male body,
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.140]   they become discontent with their body,
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.160]   and they wanna be a different body,
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.780]   which is very similar to what happened
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.760]   in the first century with the Gnostics.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.820]   The Gnostics believe everything material,
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.300]   everything physical was evil,
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.100]   and everything spiritual was good,
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.300]   and so the goal for the Gnostic,
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.700]   especially the Docetic type of Gnostics,
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.600]   was to escape the body, get out of the body,
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.180]   and this is one of the main reasons
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.320]   that 1 John was written, to refute that kind of Docetism.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.060]   We have it revisited today,
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.480]   and this whole transgender thing,
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.760]   this is not anything new to history,
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.420]   people being uncomfortable with who they are on the inside,
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.620]   rejecting who they are on the outside,
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.820]   and the way in which God has created them,
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.180]   and as a result of that, they just become unhappy people.
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.340]   Well, let me tell you something,
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.140]   and I've counseled transgenders before,
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.340]   God does not create junk, he doesn't do that.
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.980]   Your body wasn't created like that,
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.180]   and God didn't make a mistake,
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.700]   you're not his first mistake in all of human history,
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.860]   no, no, no, in all of eternity,
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.360]   you're not his first mistake,
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.740]   he doesn't make mistakes like that,
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.000]   so that means you have to bring your thinking
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.100]   and your feelings in line with the way
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.900]   in which you were created,
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.180]   and learn to be happy with the way in which you were created
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:12.160]   as a male or as a female, this is really key.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.160]   You can self-identify yourself as a frog, I don't care,
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.420]   but you're unhappy with the way
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.700]   in which God has created you, all right?
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.340]   This self-identity thing is going to wreak havoc
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.860]   among young people today,
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.540]   because they believe this false notion,
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.980]   this horrible notion, and it's a self-destructive notion,
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.980]   that somehow I can determine who I want to be,
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.540]   all just on the basis of my willpower.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.500]   That's who I am, all right?
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.480]   No, no, no, you can't do that, you're going to wreak havoc.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.060]   A thousand years from now,
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.780]   you can have sex reassignment surgery,
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.940]   and you can change all the soft tissue in your body,
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.480]   and take all the hormones of the opposite sex,
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.900]   but a thousand years from now, they dig up your skeleton,
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.340]   they'll know immediately whether or not
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.180]   you were a male or a female.
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.300]   You're not going to change your skeletal structure.
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.540]   Not going to do that.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.120]   God doesn't create junk.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.340]   What God created, he said, was very good.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.380]   That was very good.
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.940]   The way you were created as a male, as a female,
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.260]   was very good, that's not a bad thing,
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.460]   and it never was a bad thing.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.020]   And it's important that we agree with God
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.420]   in this particular area.
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.400]   So, God created a husband-wife relationship
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.680]   in order to complement one another,
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.120]   in order to be companions with one another,
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.120]   in order to experience one fleshness
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.480]   in the fullest extent.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.560]   You're never ever going to be one flesh,
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.560]   not in the fullest spiritual sense
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.820]   that the Bible describes, with a robot
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.760]   that's anonymically the opposite sex.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.400]   You're never going to be one flesh.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.720]   It's only with another human being
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.080]   that is in a heterosexual relationship.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.960]   You'll never be one flesh, in the same sense,
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.640]   with someone of the same sex.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.000]   You'll never be one flesh through masturbation,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.640]   and most theologians, and I think that they're right,
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.880]   believe that masturbation is the first step
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.240]   towards homosexuality because it is the same sex
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.240]   satisfying the same sex.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.560]   That's the first steps in that direction.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   You're never going to be that way,
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.160]   and you're never going to understand
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.720]   what true companionship and complementarianism is
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.880]   until you're absolutely satisfied
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.440]   with who you are in your body,
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.280]   and the way in which God has created you.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.640]   God called it, again, very good.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.520]   So, that's the first principle
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.160]   I think we've gotta nail down.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.520]   The first principle is that sex and marriage
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.520]   is a pure and very holy thing.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.680]   Sex and marriage is pure and holy.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.680]   God called it not just good, but very good.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.620]   This is important.
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.480]   And as Hebrews chapter 13 and verse four says,
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.920]   "Let the marriage bed be held in honor among all,
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.360]   "and let the marriage bed be undefiled,"
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.640]   or let marriage be held in honor among all,
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.200]   let the marriage bed be undefiled.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.880]   This is a pure and holy thing.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.200]   It's not a dirty thing, it's a good thing,
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.840]   it's a very pure thing.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.160]   And in fact, how dare we call something dirty
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.480]   what God has called not just good,
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.640]   but God has called very good.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.760]   So, that gets us away from that Victorian view of sexuality
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:54.240]   that somehow that says that sex is a dirty topic,
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.320]   it's a bad thing, you should never talk about it.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.240]   I realize that we live in a culture
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.960]   that is twisted in such a bad way
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.920]   that almost every reference to sex
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.280]   is a negative, God-dishonoring reference,
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.040]   and it tends to make us as Christians in our thinking
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.880]   think that sex is a negative thing,
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.020]   but God never created it like that.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.880]   It's a very beautiful thing.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.800]   In fact, this is one of the things
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.200]   I spend a lot of time with when I'm working with
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.960]   or trying to counsel a person who is homosexual or lesbian,
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.320]   in this particular case,
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.200]   I want them to understand how beautiful
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.800]   the heterosexual relationship was originally designed to be.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.540]   And when they get done,
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.200]   when I'm done painting that mural for them
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.420]   on what it's going to be,
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.520]   all of a sudden they realize how their practices
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.840]   and what they do are so inconsistent
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.480]   with what God designed it to be, now they're changing.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.000]   In fact, we have a guy in our fellowship group,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.560]   there, Grace, he is formerly a part
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.720]   of the homosexual community there in L.A.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.920]   He was a leader among them.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.200]   He was a significant leader among them.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.880]   He came to Christ, was gloriously saved,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.200]   and he just told me the other day,
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.280]   guess what, I'm dating a young lady here.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.140]   I'm going, she-ass.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.280]   This is so great.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.240]   This is wonderful there at the church.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.980]   And so it's really good to see those kind of things
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.800]   happen, transformations genuinely occur.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:24.800]   So the implication is the heterosexual relationship
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.900]   in a monogamous marriage of commitment
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.280]   is what God has intended from the very beginning,
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.560]   and that it is a pure thing,
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.280]   and that it is very much a holy thing.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.600]   It's not a dirty thing.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.360]   It's not a bad thing.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.400]   And we've got to get those kind of thoughts out of our head.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.560]   It's a very good thing.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.120]   Now there's a second thing I want you to understand.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.720]   Not only that, but I want you to understand
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.600]   that sex is not the maces of marriage,
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.720]   and marriage is not a sexual relationship.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.120]   This is important to see as well,
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.900]   which sort of gets us away from this postmodern view
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.320]   over here that says the highest of all human relationships
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.920]   is having great sex.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.840]   That's not true either.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.840]   Sex is an expression of marriage.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.840]   It can be an expression of one fleshness,
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.040]   and a couple's companionship,
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.520]   but it is not the form of the highest
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.300]   of all human relationships.
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.880]   It's not it at all.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   Sex is a very important part of marriage.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.440]   There's no doubt about that.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.760]   Not to participate in it wholeheartedly,
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.120]   aggressively, and passionately is sin against God,
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.280]   spouse, as well as self.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.280]   But sex does not equal marriage.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.320]   Since the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.080]   made sex equal to marriage.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.200]   That's the reason why when a young man, young woman
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.040]   in Roman Catholicism would have sex prior to marriage,
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.960]   they would try to get them married as quickly as possible.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.360]   That's one of the worst things that can happen.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.240]   Sex does not equal marriage.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.320]   Any two human beings can have sex.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.500]   Any two animals can have sex.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.640]   Any two gerbils can have sex.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.880]   But that doesn't mean that that equals marriage.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.920]   It doesn't mean that.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.320]   And it never meant that in the Bible at all.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.100]   There's no place in the Bible for that.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.000]   Sex does not equal marriage.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.820]   Sex is an expression of marriage,
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.820]   but it's not the same thing as marriage.
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:29.320]   Unity in marriage that the Bible talks about
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:33.200]   goes way beyond just the sexual relationship.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.760]   And I think you understand that.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:41.200]   Let me give you an illustration about this.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.240]   Back several years ago, we had a couple in our church.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.540]   Been married for about 12 years.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:54.040]   Called me up, said they wanted to come in for counseling.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.080]   I said, "Sure."
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.480]   So we set a time to meet.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.160]   I couldn't imagine, they were a very active
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.680]   part of our church, very involved, wonderful couple.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.080]   They loved the Lord.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.280]   Couldn't imagine what they wanted to come in
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.680]   and talk with me about.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.920]   So they came in, I had prayer, I said,
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.820]   "Hey, what prompted you to come in for counseling?
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.720]   "Why do you think you need it?"
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.040]   They kind of both hung their head a little bit and sighed.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.400]   And I said, "Well, you might as well tell me.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.820]   "I mean, you set up this appointment.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.020]   "Why are you here?"
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:27.100]   And they said to me, "Well, you know,
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.480]   "we've been married for 12 years."
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.320]   I said, "Yes."
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.980]   "Well, in all those 12 years,
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.560]   "we have never yet consummated our relationship."
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.840]   Now, in counseling, you're never supposed to look shocked.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.080]   But I'm sure I look something like,
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.640]   you've been married for 12 years,
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.360]   you've never consummated your relationship,
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.960]   what in the world is going on here?
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.800]   What's happened?
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.320]   They kind of hung their head,
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.920]   and then he began to describe the fact
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.840]   that he didn't know this prior to marriage,
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.020]   but he had a serious physical issue.
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.680]   And he had had several surgeries
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.960]   in order to correct that issue, it all failed,
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.940]   and now their desire to have children was quickly dying.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:17.400]   And they were beginning to think that their relationship,
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.040]   their marriage, was on the rocks.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.760]   Well, if I had a Roman Catholic view of marriage,
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.120]   I would have agreed.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.240]   Well, you can't have sex, so you're not married.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.580]   You might as well forget it.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.200]   But I didn't have a Roman Catholic view of marriage.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.760]   I said, "Listen, there are certain ways
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.180]   "you can learn to fulfill one another
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.880]   "even without having sex.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.480]   "Since he has this particular physiological problem,
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.740]   "and the doctors don't seem to have any answer for it
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.120]   "at this particular point,
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.840]   "so what are we going to do?"
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.920]   Later on, by the way, they ended up adopting
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.240]   two Chinese twin girls from China.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.780]   They're all teenagers grown up now.
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.520]   Raised 'em up in a godly Christian home.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.080]   Those two girls are out serving the Lord.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.980]   It's really great.
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.960]   But, and they're still married,
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.960]   and they're very happily married as well.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.160]   And to my knowledge, now, what,
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.680]   it's probably been 25, 30 years now,
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.280]   they've been married, and my knowledge,
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.760]   they've never ever yet consummated their relationship.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.200]   I don't think they can.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.560]   It's not possible for that to happen.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:19.000]   Well, this is the reason why we say
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   that unity in marriage goes way beyond just sexuality,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.840]   which gets us away from that postmodern view
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.360]   that says sex is the highest of all human relationships,
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.840]   and you gotta have great sex
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.800]   in order to have a great marriage.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.680]   That's not true.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.240]   Sex and what's going on in your marriage
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.160]   can be an indicator of certain problems in your marriage,
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.280]   but it doesn't mean that you've gotta be having,
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.640]   I mean, you look at these supermarket tabloids
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.080]   that you have to pass through,
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.960]   and they're all displayed on either side
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.080]   when you're checking things out.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.360]   12 ways to have great sex.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.600]   You know, all that, I mean,
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.600]   this is just thrown at you constantly, everywhere,
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.880]   but that doesn't have to be true
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.040]   God never intended that to be the case
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.360]   because marriage success is much more than sexual success.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.240]   It goes way beyond that.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.640]   Marriage success is much more than sexual success.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.360]   You say, okay, all right,
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.560]   if that gets us away from the Victorian view,
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.480]   and it also gets us away from this postmodern,
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.840]   liberated view that sort of makes sex
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.720]   the highest of all human relationships,
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.400]   if that's the case, then what is it?
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.320]   What is it, biblically?
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.320]   All right, let's talk about that.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.160]   Grab your Bible.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.960]   Let's go over to 1 Corinthians chapter seven.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.760]   Now, I'm gonna need both husbands and wives
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.220]   to put their seat belts back on,
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:48.440]   the crash helmets, and flak vests.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.640]   All right.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.360]   1 Corinthians chapter seven,
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.840]   in verse three, here we go.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.840]   The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.920]   and likewise the wife to her husband.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:16.120]   Some translations say the husband should fulfill
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.600]   his marital duty to his wife,
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.800]   and likewise the wife should fulfill
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.000]   her marital duty to her husband.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.240]   Now, when we read translations like that,
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:34.240]   we say duty, I've never viewed sex as a duty.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.520]   This is something that I am supposed to view
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.440]   like going to work every day.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.080]   That's my duty to go to work every day,
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.800]   so it's my duty to have sex.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.400]   That's my duty.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.100]   Is that what sex is?
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:53.000]   Well, the problem is not in the terminology.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.440]   The problem is in our thinking about it,
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.200]   because it's very obvious in our culture
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.120]   we have been trained to think about sexuality
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.200]   in non-biblical ways.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.580]   And what I'm gonna help you to do is face the fact
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.600]   that we need to think about it in a biblical way,
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.380]   because the Bible says that if you're a husband,
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:24.380]   then you have a marital duty to your wife.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.320]   And if you're a wife, you have a marital duty
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.880]   to your husband, or to put it the way
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.200]   the English Standard Translation makes it,
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.920]   if you're a husband, then you should give
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.180]   to your wife her conjugal rights.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.980]   And if you're a wife, you need to give
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.240]   to your husband his conjugal rights.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:50.060]   When you said, "I do," that was part of the deal.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.020]   That was it.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:55.020]   So that tells me this.
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:24:00.020]   That tells me that sex has as its primary goal
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:05.060]   that of satisfying your spouse.
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.240]   I want that to sink in.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.980]   Sex has as its primary goal
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:18.140]   that of satisfying your spouse.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.980]   The goal is not getting pleasure.
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:25.060]   The goal is not having a climax or an orgasm.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.740]   It's not necessarily to achieve children.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:33.740]   It is to provide joy to your spouse.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:39.220]   In other words, this goal is nothing about me.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:43.780]   This goal is about my spouse.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:48.220]   I am focused on doing whatever I can
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.260]   in my ministry role as a spouse
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.700]   in order to fulfill my wife,
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.020]   or a wife in order to fulfill her husband.
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.500]   That is your duty.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:04.940]   That is your spouse's conjugal rights.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:09.580]   And to withhold that from them is sinful.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.860]   To withhold that from them is sinful.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.660]   You say, "Oh, Dr. Street,
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.580]   you have just gone from preaching to meddling."
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.980]   All right?
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.980]   You are really meddling in my life.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.260]   But it is.
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.380]   When you do that, when you withhold yourself from that,
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.380]   whatever the reason,
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:33.580]   then you're not thinking about them.
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.380]   You're thinking about you.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.340]   You're thinking about you.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.300]   It's all about you.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.820]   It's all about my fulfillment.
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.580]   It's all about whether I'm happy.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.500]   It's all about whether or not I'm gratified.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:54.820]   No, that kind of thinking is not a part of Christian bed.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:59.340]   The Christian bed says, "No, it's not all about me.
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.460]   It's all about you."
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.180]   Now, God has created you in such a way
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.500]   that in fulfilling your spouse,
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.820]   you receive a considerable amount of fulfillment yourself.
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.940]   But that fulfillment is not your goal.
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.380]   That's not your goal.
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.980]   Your goal is their fulfillment.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.140]   This is kind of interesting
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.100]   because I love talking about this.
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.340]   We leave this to the very last in premarital counseling
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.700]   before couples get married.
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.180]   Last session, we talk about this thing.
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.700]   So they go off on their honeymoon.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.980]   And they have their honeymoon.
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:37.500]   And they come back and I see them there at church.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.860]   I said, "Hey, how was your honeymoon?
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.860]   Things go well?"
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.500]   "Well, yeah, we had a great honeymoon.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.500]   It was just, you know."
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.060]   "So what's the problem?"
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:49.060]   "Well, you know, we did what you told us to do.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:54.660]   I wanted to make sure my wife was absolutely fulfilled.
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.060]   I wanted to make sure my husband was absolutely fulfilled.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.380]   So I did everything that I could.
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:03.020]   And it just kind of like didn't work."
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:05.420]   All right?
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.820]   So then I ask a few more questions.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.980]   And all of a sudden, I start to discover
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.980]   that what's really going on in here
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.980]   is that she is trying to fulfill him
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.540]   the way a woman would be fulfilled.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.860]   And he is trying to fulfill her
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.820]   the way that a man would be fulfilled.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.900]   And they are like ships passing in the night.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.540]   All right?
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.500]   No, no, no.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:36.500]   Part of marital oneness is him learning
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:42.180]   what fulfills a woman that's giving her her conjugal rights
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:48.100]   and her learning what fulfills a man
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.500]   that's giving him his conjugal rights.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.500]   Then all of a sudden, when they finally catch this,
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.580]   oh my goodness.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.380]   All right?
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.140]   Then it happens.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.900]   Then it happens.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:11.900]   So the key here is that I am giving myself to my spouse
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.820]   for the purpose of their fulfillment,
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.260]   not for the purpose of my self-gratification.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.980]   So I have to retrain my thinking
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.220]   from getting pleasure to that of giving pleasure
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.620]   because our whole culture is focused
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.820]   upon getting, getting, getting, getting.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.700]   It's not focused upon giving, giving, giving, giving.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.940]   This brings the mind of Christ right into the bedroom
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.980]   where I am giving and I am giving.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.220]   I am here to minister to you on this level.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.580]   When I said I do, that's what I did.
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.380]   I gave myself to you.
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.540]   Look at verse four, all right?
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:02.660]   For the wife does not have authority over her own body,
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.820]   but the husband does.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.340]   Ooh, feminism, hates that.
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.580]   Likewise, the husband does not have authority
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:14.020]   over his own body, but the wife does.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.780]   Most men don't like that.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.980]   In other words, this thing,
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.940]   when you say I do, doesn't belong to you anymore.
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.340]   It belongs to your spouse, and you're gonna use this
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.220]   in order to fulfill them as best as you can.
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.940]   That's what you're gonna do.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.020]   You're gonna use that to fulfill them all you can.
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.900]   Oh, my word.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.460]   I know this is hard.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.780]   I know some of you are sitting there,
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.100]   you're not breathing at this particular point.
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.580]   Let me see if I can illustrate this for you.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.380]   I remember teaching this in counseling one day,
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:30:00.860]   and the wife sort of sat back, and she rolls her eyes.
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.860]   Some women have the capacity to do that.
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:07.500]   And I said, did I say something offensive?
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.500]   Did I say something wrong?
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.940]   She says, no, no, no.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.260]   She says, I know where you're going with this.
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.860]   I said, you do?
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.380]   She says, yeah.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.940]   You want me to make sure that he is absolutely fulfilled.
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.140]   I said, well, it's not what I want.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.620]   It's what the Bible is talking about.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.420]   And she says, well, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.260]   That's it.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.300]   And I said, the problem is?
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.740]   Well, she says, you don't understand my husband.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.580]   What?
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:39.140]   Well, he's got this unrelenting sex drive,
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.060]   and that doesn't stop.
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.220]   I mean, if I did this,
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.820]   I wouldn't get anything else done in my life, all right?
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.900]   And there's nothing, we've got three kids.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.300]   I gotta take care of those three kids.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.140]   What would I do?
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.940]   Should I fix supper for them?
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.020]   This is all we would end up doing.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:59.060]   I said, well, as impressed as you are
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.940]   with your husband's sex drive,
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:05.100]   I'm not sure that that is the issue here.
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.220]   I said, so I'm gonna give you an assignment.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:14.900]   This week, I want you to go home.
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.460]   When your husband comes home from work,
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.900]   I want you to make sure you put a movie on the TV,
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.140]   do whatever you want, keep the kids occupied.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.820]   You be standing behind the door with the nicest negligee,
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.820]   the one that he really likes,
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.300]   and you grab his hand and take him to bed.
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.140]   Oh.
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:34.700]   Are you serious?
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.060]   Yes, I'm absolutely serious.
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.020]   Oh.
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.060]   You can see the husband sitting in the other chair.
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.660]   He's sitting up really straight.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:47.500]   This is gonna be an interesting week for him.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:55.900]   So, they left, and she went shuffling out of the room.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:00.220]   He went skipping out of the room.
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:08.340]   Week went by.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.180]   They came back in.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.060]   I had prayer with them, and as soon as I said amen,
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.700]   she almost came across the desk,
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.380]   and she pointed right at my Bible, and she says,
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.500]   this Bible stuff works.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.580]   It works.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.620]   I said, what do you mean?
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.180]   She said, well, I did what you said.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.020]   I said, what'd you do?
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.700]   She said, well, when my husband came home,
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.060]   I was standing behind the door with a negligee on,
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.700]   and I grabbed his hand, and I took him to bed.
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.780]   First day it happened, second day it happened,
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.940]   third day it happened, fourth day it happened,
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.380]   fifth day he came in the door.
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.580]   I'm fine, I'm just fine.
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.420]   That's exactly what she said.
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.540]   I'm fine, I'm okay.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.660]   She says, this Bible stuff works.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.980]   I said, well, God designed you.
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.340]   It's supposed to work.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.160]   We have to be serious about what we're doing here.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.940]   It is part of your marital duty to fulfill your spouse.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.940]   It's just as important for the husband
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.540]   to fulfill his wife in this way.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.900]   This is really critical.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.980]   I cannot tell you how often this has changed
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.220]   the thinking of so many couples.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.940]   There are some people who will say,
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.980]   I had another woman in counseling who said to me,
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.740]   well, now, wait a minute.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:29.740]   It's just not my nature to be aggressive or assertive.
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.660]   I'm just kind of quiet, and she kind of sat there
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.660]   and flicked her eyes a little bit.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.860]   It's just not my nature.
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.860]   I know what she was saying.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.340]   She was basically saying to me, well,
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.660]   I'm just too quiet and passive for me
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.980]   to initiate anything like this in our marriage.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.340]   I just can't do that.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:55.580]   And she kind of sat back, self-satisfied with that comment,
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.900]   and I said, let me ask you a question.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.340]   It's just like anything else in life.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.580]   Are you gonna let your nature rule you
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.060]   or what God's word says rule you?
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.620]   What are you gonna do here?
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.780]   Are you gonna allow your nature to rule you
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.100]   or what God's word says?
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:17.100]   When you said, I do,
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.460]   you gave yourself to your husband,
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.740]   and now you're holding back from him?
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:24.860]   What are you doing?
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.660]   No wonder there's so many problems.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:31.820]   No wonder there's so much unfaithfulness.
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.860]   We're not taking this seriously in the Christian realm,
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.260]   and it needs to be taken seriously.
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.740]   Are we going to allow our natures to guide us
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.740]   or what God's word says guide us?
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:46.300]   'Cause there's a lot of things in God's word
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.460]   that's not my nature.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:52.260]   When God says, I need to forgive someone
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.020]   who has horribly offended me,
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.820]   that just is not my nature to do that.
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:00.500]   But I know I need to do it.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.980]   I know I need to do it.
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.300]   And the same thing's true here.
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:09.940]   You have gotta take the initiative
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:12.260]   to make sure your spouse is fulfilled.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.580]   I'm speaking to men as well as the women here.
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.940]   This is such a key thing.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.860]   This presumes, and this is one of the reasons
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.740]   why we had this communication thing
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.420]   before we had the sex talk thing,
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.980]   because this presumes there has to be
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.540]   good, honest communication going on
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.940]   between a husband and wife
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.060]   so that the husband communicates
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.660]   whether or not he's fulfilled or not,
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.340]   the wife communicates whether or not she's fulfilled or not,
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:42.180]   and neither person is being offended
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.620]   by what the other person says,
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.940]   but they're willing to throw themselves
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.420]   into being a problem solver in this area.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.180]   They're willing to do this.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.540]   Are you breathing?
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:56.780]   Okay, take a good oxygen.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:00.180]   Okay, there we go.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.500]   All right, so sex has its primary goal,
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.620]   that is satisfying your mate.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.420]   Now there's a fourth thing.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.820]   The fourth thing is this.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.940]   That God created both the husband and wife
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.380]   with an equal ability to satisfy one another.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.500]   God created both the husband and a wife
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.500]   with an equal ability to satisfy one another.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.860]   Now this is really critical here.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:31.660]   Sometimes just by nature of the educational setting
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.580]   that I'm in, I read a lot of stuff,
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.660]   and I read feminists talk about
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.020]   they teach women through television magazines,
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.100]   through some academic literature
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.020]   that sex is for number one, manipulation,
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.260]   number two, self-indulgence,
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:48.220]   number three, financial gain, all right?
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.180]   That's what sex is for.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.580]   It's for manipulation,
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.900]   for self-indulgence, and financial gain.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.660]   That's what secular feminism says.
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.380]   You want something to destroy your relationship,
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.020]   whether a man adopts that philosophy
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.940]   or a woman adopts that philosophy,
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.860]   that will destroy your relationship.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.380]   You buy into that feministic idea,
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.620]   and it will wreck a marriage
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.180]   because all of that is all about
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:15.380]   my personal self-gratification,
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.740]   what I consider is important to me,
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.140]   not what is important to my spouse.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.180]   That's such a key thing.
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.860]   And God created the husband and wife
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.260]   with an equal ability to satisfy each other.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.820]   No one has soul, power, or authority.
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:35.460]   You do not have this independent of your spouse.
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.660]   You don't.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:37.860]   Your body belongs to them.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.940]   Their body belongs to you.
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.500]   That means both should be aggressive.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.420]   That means that as a man,
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.460]   I'm not gonna go to work
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.500]   and totally exhaust myself during the day
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.020]   and leave nothing for my wife in bed at night.
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.100]   I'm gonna leave some energy for her.
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.980]   That's part of my marital duty.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.140]   I'm not gonna exhaust myself.
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.020]   As a woman, I'm not gonna exhaust myself
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:04.180]   with my job or my children during the day.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:08.060]   I'm gonna leave part of that energy for my husband.
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.140]   I'm gonna do that.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.940]   Both should be aggressive.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.820]   Sexual relationships are to be equal and reciprocal.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.340]   And it carries the mind of Christ,
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.180]   which basically says,
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:25.780]   I am here to find out how I can minister to you
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.740]   in this area of our marriage.
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.260]   Wow, that is the mind of Christ.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:34.100]   How can I minister to you in this area of my marriage?
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:38.820]   Ecclesiastes 9.9 is a very important,
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.300]   which talks about,
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.740]   I remember several years ago,
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.220]   I did a marriage retreat just like this
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:47.420]   up in Sacramento area.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.700]   It was actually up in Lake Tahoe.
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.180]   And we were in this big auditorium
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.580]   and had an all glass side
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.100]   and they were looking out on Lake Tahoe
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:54.940]   and the mountains and everything.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.860]   And I'm not sure they even looked at me,
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.980]   but, which is okay.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.060]   They can look at that as long as they were listening.
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:06.140]   And during that marriage conference,
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:06.980]   the pastor says,
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.580]   how do you wanna theme this?
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.380]   Was right around Valentine's Day.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.220]   So I said, well, let's theme it like this.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.940]   Ecclesiastes 9.9, will you be my Valentine?
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.780]   So the whole thing was about that.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.460]   And we had a wonderful weekend.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.940]   Everything went really well.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.620]   And then when the weekend's over,
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.420]   everybody went back to their respective jobs and everything.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.060]   And about 10, 11 months later,
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.500]   I got a call from the pastor.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:38.420]   And he said to me,
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.900]   you remember the seminar you did up at Lake Tahoe?
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.860]   And I said, yeah, I do.
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:46.300]   He says, well, you realize how much trouble
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.220]   you caused us in our church.
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.420]   I'm going, no, that's not my role.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.220]   I wanna be able to go in and compliment your ministry.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.460]   I'm thinking to myself, what did I do?
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.300]   What did I say?
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.700]   I don't know what I did.
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.940]   And then he started laughing on the other end of the phone.
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.100]   I said, what's going on?
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.260]   He says, well, he says, I wanna let you know
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.180]   that we have had a baby explosion in our church.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.260]   [congregation laughing]
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.980]   We have gone into a building program
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:15.980]   to triple our nursery size, all right, in our church.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:20.020]   And we all attribute it back to that Lake Tahoe event.
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.260]   All right?
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.460]   That's what happened.
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.100]   So I just sent them into an entire new building program.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.180]   And I realize around here, you can't build anything.
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.980]   So I don't know what you're gonna do.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.620]   So after this, you're gonna be in deep trouble.
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:38.380]   So anyhow, there you go.
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.140]   Ecclesiastes 9.9, will you be my Valentine?
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.060]   Sexual relationships need to be equal.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.820]   They need to be reciprocal.
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.620]   Proverbs, this is really interesting.
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.700]   Grab your Bible just for a moment.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.100]   I want you to go back, put a marker here
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.100]   in 1 Corinthians 7.
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.900]   And I want you to go back to Proverbs chapter five.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:01.940]   Proverbs chapter five, this is kind of interesting.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.280]   When Solomon's talking about this, he says,
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:14.180]   in verse 18, he says, he's talking about
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.980]   the sexual relationship between a husband and wife.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:17.220]   He says, "Let your fountain be blessed
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.220]   "and rejoice in the wife of your youth."
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.140]   Now, it's really interesting.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.380]   In arid climate back in those days,
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.880]   sex was like taking a refreshing glass of water.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.500]   When you live in an arid climate,
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.240]   that's what it's equated to.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.820]   And so it's like a fountain.
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.460]   It's described as a fountain.
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.660]   And earlier, it's talked about a cistern,
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.500]   a well, springs, streams, that's sexuality.
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.620]   Verse 19 says, "A loving doe, a graceful doe,
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:46.100]   "let her breast fill you all times with delight.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.540]   "Be intoxicated always with her love."
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.180]   And this is one of the rare times in all the Bible
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:54.940]   where the Bible says it's okay to get drunk.
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:59.020]   It's okay to get drunk, not on alcohol,
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:04.020]   but it's okay to get drunk on your husband or your wife.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.100]   It's okay.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.780]   Be intoxicated by them.
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.740]   Someday, I'm gonna preach a series of messages
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.500]   on all the places in the Bible it's okay to get drunk.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.580]   All right, that should draw some people.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.300]   [congregation laughing]
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.620]   All right, well, this is one of 'em.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.860]   The Hebrew word is very clear.
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:24.300]   It's the same word that's used to get drunk on alcohol.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.060]   Sakaar, which is beer,
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.920]   or ayin, which is wine in the Hebrew language.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.760]   It's the same kind of thing.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.760]   It's okay to get drunk on your love of your wife.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:41.740]   Verse 20, "Why should you be intoxicated, my son,
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.020]   "with a forbidden woman,
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.180]   "and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:50.800]   "For a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord,
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.260]   "and he ponders all of his paths.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.680]   "The iniquity of the wicked ensnare him,
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.320]   "and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.720]   "He dies for lack of discipline,
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:03.100]   "and because of his great folly, he is led astray."
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.700]   In other words, we have a lot more self-discipline
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.300]   than we're willing to give ourself credit for,
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.820]   and God watches everything that we do.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:16.380]   So you should be so overwhelmed
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:20.040]   that you cannot get one bit more satisfaction
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.380]   from anyone else or anything else
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:27.380]   than the deep abiding soul satisfaction
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.680]   of ministering to your spouse.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:34.380]   That goes way beyond just the physical satisfaction
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:39.380]   of bathing your brain in some kind of release of chemicals
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:43.260]   from an orgasm or a climax.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:44.460]   It goes way beyond that.
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:50.220]   This is a deep abiding soul satisfaction
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:54.700]   that God is very pleased with what you are doing.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.860]   This is a good thing.
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:00.060]   This is an important thing.
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:03.380]   So God created both the husband and wife
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.460]   with an equal ability to satisfy each other.
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.340]   Number five, I want you to understand this as well,
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:13.180]   that pleasure then in sex is not sinful and forbidden,
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:16.960]   but it is assured and even encouraged.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.860]   We can see that in Proverbs 5, verses 18 and 19.
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.780]   Satisfying your spouse is to be
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:27.280]   a deeply satisfying experience for you.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:31.460]   It's just that your experience is not the goal,
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.700]   but your spouse's experience is.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.740]   And when you get a husband and wife
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.420]   who has that kind of commitment to one another,
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.340]   they're interested in the other person
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.180]   having the best experience as possible,
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:47.100]   then you have a tremendous relationship,
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.100]   not just in the sexual experience,
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:52.340]   but in both knowing they are pleasing God
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.660]   by ministering to each other in such a way.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:56.700]   This is such a key.
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:00.420]   This is something the world will never understand.
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:04.040]   Because everything in the world,
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.980]   everything that talks about sex in the world
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.900]   is all about self-gratification.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.500]   It's about self-gratifying self,
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:17.260]   which is greed-oriented sex,
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.180]   and all kinds of greed-oriented sex
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.720]   has no place in the Christian life.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.380]   We are to be ravished, or intoxicated,
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:30.780]   or exhilarated by our spouses.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.060]   That's what should happen.
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:38.140]   Ephesians chapter 5, just for a moment,
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:43.780]   in verse 3, here Paul says,
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:49.260]   "For sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness,"
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.620]   there's the greed, "must not even be named among you
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:55.180]   "as is proper among the saints."
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:46:00.100]   The word sexual immorality is the Greek term poinaia.
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.980]   It doesn't just refer to pornography.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:04.540]   It means any kind of illicit sexual activity,
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:07.560]   or any kind of impurity or covetousness.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.580]   That covetousness is greed-oriented sex.
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:15.580]   There's nothing more greedy than masturbation.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.100]   Nothing more greedy than that.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:22.320]   That's the ultimate expression of greed sex.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.600]   That shouldn't even be named among God's people.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.140]   Shouldn't even be a part of it.
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:31.940]   Instead, exercising personal self-control,
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:35.220]   which means that pornography shouldn't be a part
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.560]   of any of this.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.180]   Once you introduce pornography
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.300]   into a Christian marriage environment,
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.100]   then either watching those things
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.300]   in order to have better sex, those kind of things,
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.800]   you're not really having sex with each other anymore.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.800]   You're having sex with people on the screen,
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.500]   or what you're seeing in pictures.
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:56.780]   And men's pornography is different than women's pornography.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.420]   There in some cases, women's pornography
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.380]   is a much bigger issue in our culture,
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.980]   in the Christian culture, than men's pornography is.
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.300]   Men have a terrible problem with it.
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.340]   There's no doubt about that, but women do too.
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:10.300]   It's just that it's different.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:13.380]   The women's is more acceptable in the Christian culture.
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:14.300]   The men's is not.
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.860]   Men's is about pictures of women.
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:21.900]   Women is more about words and storylines.
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:26.060]   Romance novels are women's pornography,
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.760]   because they do the same thing to a woman
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.020]   in her thinking and her body
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.700]   as the pictures does to a man.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.440]   But you'll go to many church libraries,
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.820]   you're never gonna find men's pornography in there,
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:39.820]   but you'll find a lot of women's pornography
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.060]   in church libraries.
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.920]   And it should never be.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:48.460]   We had a graduate student who did a complete thorough study
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:51.460]   of numerous churches on women's pornography.
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.620]   She was a woman, graduate student woman,
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.540]   and she came to unbelievable conclusions
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.440]   in her final graduate thesis on this.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.100]   And in reading that thesis, I became convinced
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.660]   this is a much bigger problem than I ever thought.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:06.960]   It is just huge.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.500]   It's just a huge issue.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.820]   No, no, no, this is not the way Christians act.
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:14.900]   That's not it at all.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.060]   That's not the way Christians function.
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.380]   They don't drown themselves in romance novels
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:23.380]   or in television programs, soap operas.
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.020]   They don't do that.
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.940]   Christians don't develop their thinking from that.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.940]   They develop their thinking from the Word of God,
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.820]   and they minister to one another.
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.620]   Anytime you indulge in those kind of things,
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:39.300]   then you are training your mind to be conformed
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.420]   to the principles of this world.
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.900]   You're not training your mind to be biblical,
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.380]   and that will wreak havoc in your marriage.
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.100]   It'll show itself up in your inability
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:56.140]   to be excited about your relationship with your spouse.
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.100]   It'll undermine everything.
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:03.700]   This is why I really think that this whole trend
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.660]   towards robotic partners in the future
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.260]   is gonna be devastating, because your robotic partner
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.420]   is never gonna get fat, they're never gonna get sick,
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.580]   they're never gonna have bad breath,
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.380]   they're always going to be willing,
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:17.980]   et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:21.180]   It's gonna wreak havoc, and we won't know in the future
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:24.820]   what genuine companionship is really about.
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:26.620]   We won't understand that.
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:28.660]   But we're already seeing part of that
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:32.620]   because of the role that both men and women's pornography
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.900]   is playing, and how it's undermining marriage.
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.860]   That's not what it should be.
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:42.820]   There should be no greed, self-gratifying kind of sex
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:46.100]   even hinted at among Christians.
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.460]   Shouldn't be there, if we're gonna be pure.
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:53.340]   So the idea here is that pleasure in sex
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.220]   is not sinful and forbidden, it's assured
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.780]   and even encouraged, but it's within the right context,
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.580]   that is monogamous marriage, with the right kind
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.620]   of relationship, and that is heterosexuality.
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:10.020]   That's the way God intended the expression of sex
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.460]   to be seen.
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.860]   Number six, last of all, then sexual relationships
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.420]   should be regular and continuous.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:20.860]   Go back to 1 Corinthians 7, you can see this.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.660]   Verse five, "Do not deprive one another except perhaps
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:30.400]   "by agreement for a limited time that you may devote
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.440]   "yourself to prayer, but then come together again
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.880]   "so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.460]   "of self-control."
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:43.060]   This is really key, because what Paul does here
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:46.540]   in the marital relationship, he outlines four
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:51.540]   very key things about not having sex.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:56.740]   Four things are listed here in verse five
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.940]   of when you are not to have sex.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:02.600]   Number one, it has to be, notice this,
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:07.500]   not one person's, but mutual agreement.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.600]   This is not a good time.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:12.020]   It has to be by mutual agreement.
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.260]   It's not when one party decides we're not gonna do this.
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.140]   If that's true, then you are cheating your spouse
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.740]   of conjugal rights, right?
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:23.580]   Number two, there's an agreed upon time.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.740]   There's agreed upon time.
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.300]   What does he say?
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:30.860]   For a limited time, he says.
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:31.700]   For a limited time.
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.020]   In other words, for a short amount of time,
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.880]   we're not gonna have sex.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.740]   There may be various reasons behind that.
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.500]   Could be sickness, could be illness, could be
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:44.500]   other things are distracting, family crisis situation.
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:47.060]   There's an agreed upon time, we're not gonna be able
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:52.060]   to do this, but it's mutually agreed is the idea.
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:56.020]   And then some translations say for fasting and prayer,
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.500]   others say just prayer, but the implication,
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:01.280]   any time that prayer's introduced here,
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.740]   and especially that of fasting,
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:08.040]   is during genuine crisis situation, as by the way,
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.100]   was going on in the Corinthian church
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:11.600]   when Paul is writing this.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:16.600]   We know this later on because Paul refers here
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.920]   in 1 Corinthians 7, in verse 26,
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.280]   in view of this present distress,
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.200]   Christians were under quite a bit of strain
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.280]   at that particular time, it's better to devote yourself
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:34.220]   to prayer and fasting than devote yourself to sexuality
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.400]   at that particular point because of this crisis situation,
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.040]   but during those crisis situations are good times
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.620]   not to be involved in sexuality.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:48.880]   And then he says, last of all, then you terminate,
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:53.600]   that is, not having sex, and you start again, why?
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.080]   Notice, he says at the end of verse five,
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:59.280]   come together again so that Satan will not tempt you
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.200]   because of your lack of self-control.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.540]   Once a couple is used to a mutually satisfying,
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:08.800]   self-giving relationship within the sexual realm,
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.320]   and all of a sudden that comes to an end,
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:17.320]   then Satan uses that as a temptation with other people,
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:22.640]   it starts in your thinking, for a woman,
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.720]   other men that you're around, for a man,
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.360]   other women that you're around,
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.000]   once you're used to a mutually satisfying relationship
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.360]   and all of a sudden it's cut off
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.800]   and it's not started back up again,
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:36.380]   then Satan uses that as a means to gain a foothold
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:39.300]   in your marriage, that becomes a problem.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.680]   So we have four guidelines, mutual agreement,
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:49.920]   agreed upon time, fasting and prayer,
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.560]   then you terminate not having sex, and you start again.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.340]   Those are the four guidelines.
[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:05.440]   Well, I know there's probably a lot more that you have,
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.880]   and there's actually a lot more that I have,
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:12.000]   but at least I've given you the basics on that.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.520]   So just remember Romans chapter 14, verse 23,
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.720]   whatever you can't do in faith is sin for you,
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.920]   so you're not gonna expect your wife or your husband
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.320]   to do things that are gonna be repugnant to them.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.040]   You're not gonna expect that,
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.960]   and by the way, by you expecting that,
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.920]   then you're thinking about sex being for you
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:30.960]   and not for them.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.520]   So you're not gonna expect your husband or wife
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.960]   to do things that they can't do with a whole heart,
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.000]   whatever it may be, in the sexual bed,
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.900]   because that's not right for the Christian.
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:48.800]   So there you have these six principles.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.920]   Let me review them one last time for you real quickly.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.320]   Number one, sex in marriage is pure and holy.
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.520]   Number two, sex is not the basis of marriage,
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.520]   and marriage is not a sexual relationship.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.540]   Number three, sex has as its primary goal
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.420]   that is satisfying your mate.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.180]   Number four, God created both the husband and wife
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:08.840]   with an equal ability to satisfy each other.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.300]   Number five, pleasure in sex is not sinful and forbidden,
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:14.240]   but assured and even encouraged.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.440]   And then number six, six sexual relationships
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:23.400]   should be regular and continuous in marriage.
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.140]   It should be.
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:30.580]   It has been a delight doing this with you,
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:33.340]   even though you're not breathing.
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.300]   Let's bow for prayer.
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:40.120]   Gracious Father, we thank you for the goodness of your word.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.400]   It really clarifies a lot of things
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.520]   that possibly have been wrong in our marriage
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.120]   that we need to make right.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:53.440]   We need to make sure that we are doing things your way,
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:57.200]   and that ends up solving a lot of problems.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:00.060]   When we end up violating your word,
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:04.080]   Proverbs tells us the way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:09.080]   Proverbs later says, Proverbs 18.21 that,
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:14.140]   or 13.21, that adversity pursues sinners.
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:17.420]   And we don't want adversity and hardship
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:18.720]   to pursue our marriages.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:23.820]   We want them to be the pleasant, sweet
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:27.900]   type of companionship that you have intended
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.160]   from the very beginning.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:32.860]   So Father, I pray for each man or woman
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:36.020]   present here today, you'll watch over them,
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:39.100]   provide for them the desire and the will
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.660]   to make the necessary changes in their thinking
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:46.180]   and in their marriage that need to happen.
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:47.820]   And then Father, we will be careful
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:51.560]   to give you all the praise and all the glory,
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:54.620]   and all God's people said, amen.
