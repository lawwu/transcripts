[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   So I'm recording this episode a few days after the American presidential election.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.520]   For those of us like me who study technology and its impact on our lives, elections can
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.400]   be particularly relevant and particularly worrisome.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.400]   Now why is that?
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.760]   It's because the dynamics of the lead up to elections, especially American presidential
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.520]   elections, have a way of heightening a lot of the specific dynamics that make modern
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.000]   technology problematic.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.160]   Let me be very specific about this.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.080]   First, the environment in the lead up to an election amplifies the interruptive nature
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.940]   of digital content.
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.820]   So what I mean by that is the interruptive nature of digital content is the idea that
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.600]   you feel compelled to check in on, say, a social media feed or an online news site or
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.940]   newsletter subscriptions.
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.160]   You feel a need to check in on it during the middle of other things.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.220]   It thus interrupts whatever you're working on.
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.480]   During elections, this trend or this poll becomes much more heightened because there
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.880]   is this very strong sense that there could be at any moment highly salient breaking news.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.760]   And it could be something that happened that could change the election, or it could be
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.200]   a particular hot take that you want to know about because it's going to make you happy
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.480]   or a take that's going to make you really upset about what's going on.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.800]   Poll numbers is a classic example of these.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.960]   It's intermittent reinforcement.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.680]   They could drop at any moment and someone could be commenting on them.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.480]   So during election seasons, this idea that I need to pull out that phone one more time,
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.800]   that becomes extra strong.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800]   Why is that a problem?
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.700]   Because context switching is an expensive neural operation.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.320]   When you turn your attention from the conversation that you're having from the book you're trying
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.960]   to read, the memo you're trying to write, the meeting you're trying to pay attention
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.680]   to, when you switch your attention from that to a phone and you see something that's highly
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.500]   salient and emotionally arousing, it triggers an expensive cognitive context shift within
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.640]   your own head.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.560]   These operations can take five, 10, up to 15 or 20 minutes for your mind to completely
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.320]   change its cognitive context, but you're not giving it time to do that.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.400]   You're glancing, you're initiating, and then you're returning to what you're doing before.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.700]   You've triggered this expensive change of where your mind is focused and you abort that
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.080]   change and try to bring it back to what you're doing before, and before your attention can
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.040]   fully settle on what you were actually trying to do, you check something else and initiate
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.760]   a new unrelated change.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.620]   The result is an incoherent cognitive context.
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.240]   You feel mentally exhausted and drained.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.560]   That feeling that people associate with the sort of pre-election period, a big part of
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.240]   that is actually an exhausted brain.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.840]   It can't keep switching back cognitive context.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.440]   The second issue that's amplified with technology during the pre-election season is that the
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.800]   emotional salience of the content you're looking at is amplified.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.220]   That is, its ability to create a strong emotional reaction is much more heightened than a typical
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.560]   content cycle.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.880]   You're much more likely to see something that is going to make you arouse in the sense of
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:24.800]   very happy, very upset, outraged, afraid, frustrated, panicky, dread.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.600]   Why this happens is because there's always a competition going on to create the content
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.960]   that's going to move to the top of the curation wars.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.240]   You have to remember, if you're running a platform like Twitter, there's hundreds of
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.900]   millions of tweets being generated a day.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.900]   The average user is going to see a couple hundred.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.520]   There's this intense informational Darwinian battle for what actually makes it to your
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.840]   attention.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840]   It's somewhat algorithmic.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.800]   A lot of it actually has to do with more cybernetic dynamics, such as amplification through power
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.440]   law, expanding follower graphs.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.440]   I actually wrote a whole New Yorker piece about this two years ago, where I got into
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.520]   how Twitter works and selects content.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.920]   It's not just digital.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.400]   It's people plus digital.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.880]   The point is, it's an incredibly complex competition.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.800]   The things that are most arousing tend to win.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.200]   You have a lot of competition to win.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.400]   A lot of people are trying to gain and win the attention game during the election, so
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.440]   they're really pushing and trying all sorts of different angles to get to the top of this
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.440]   catch-your-attention tournament.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.280]   As a result, the stuff you see in election cycle just hits that nervous system and is
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.600]   very innervating.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.040]   That itself is also very draining and exhausting.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.720]   Now that the election is over and our minds are hopelessly scrambled and our nervous systems
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:54.120]   are strung out, what should we, listeners of this podcast, conscious users of technologies
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.000]   and seekers of the deep life, what do we do?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.420]   Well, I wrote an essay about this for my newsletter at calnewport.com.
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.420]   It has a big proposal.
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.200]   I think it's the right proposal, and that's what I want to go through today in today's
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.920]   deep dive.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.240]   If you're watching this episode instead of just listening, you'll see I have loaded that
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.600]   essay up on my screen here.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.880]   This was on calnewport.com.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.740]   It was also sent to people who subscribe to my email newsletter.
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.800]   The title of this piece is "After You Vote, Unplug."
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.840]   I want to start with the suggestion.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.360]   Here's the meat of what I'm suggesting.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.360]   I'm going to read here from the article.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.880]   Here I have a suggestion that I think could be healing for all points of the political
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.880]   spectrum.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.760]   "Use the stress of this election to be the final push needed to step away from the exhausting
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.000]   digital chatter that's been dominating your brain."
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.400]   What I'm suggesting in this article is in the post-election period, you take a substantial
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.520]   break from these digital content sources that have been so exhausting and draining over
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.040]   the past few months.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.480]   Use the election as an excuse to at least temporarily reform your relationship with
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.480]   the digital.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.680]   What does that mean, "step away"?
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.800]   I have four specific suggestions I give in the article.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.700]   Number one, I say take a break from social media.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.880]   I mean that.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.880]   Stop looking at it.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   Stop posting.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:40.160]   Just go right now, cold turkey, I mean, unless you are a political commentator who makes
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.120]   a living off of like Twitter commentary in your sub stack, so basically, unless you're
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.040]   like Matthew Yglesias, take a break from social media.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   Don't look at it.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.800]   Take the apps off your phone, right, so they're just not there.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.200]   Log out on your computer, so it's not easy on Safari on your phone just to go to the
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.280]   sites and look in it.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.680]   Basically don't post anything on it.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.320]   Don't seek out hot takes on it.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.800]   As we'll soon cover, there's better places to get information right now, and you don't
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.060]   need information all the time.
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:17.040]   Social media, I think, is probably the worst of the offenders in terms of a negative physiological
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.040]   and psychological impact on you during the election season because of the dynamics we
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.040]   just discussed.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.040]   Social media is sort of the worst offender, so I have the strongest suggestion there.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.040]   Take a break.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.640]   All right, suggestion number two, and I'm reading from the article here, stop listening
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.640]   to news podcasts.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.800]   Jesse, we've got to be really clear.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.000]   This is not a news podcast.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.640]   This podcast is the anecdote, right?
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.200]   This will be the anecdote to an antidote, an anecdote, and we'll tell some anecdotes,
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.400]   but it's the antidote to the news podcast.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.040]   I'm a fan of news podcasts, by the way.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.900]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:00.240]   It's like hearkening back to the days where you would listen to the radio news, but we've
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.160]   got to take a break from it now.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.600]   You've been so immersed in this information, and what you want to take a break from is
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:15.120]   just people having just these conversations about what's happening and how they feel about
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   it.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.760]   You don't need to be immersed further in the trauma or celebration, depending on what side
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.160]   of the political spectrum you are right now, with strangers.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.440]   We're going to take a temporary break from news podcasts.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.560]   That's both news Roundup style podcasts, like The Daily, or if you're center right, like
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.240]   The Dispatch, but also like the News Analysis podcast or the Independent Media podcast,
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:42.060]   so Barry Weiss's Honestly podcast, or whatever she calls it now, where people are talking
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.060]   about the news.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.360]   We're taking a temporary break from these.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   Not forever.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.360]   We're taking a temporary break.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.360]   All right.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.360]   Third suggestion.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.240]   Unsubscribe, at least for a while, from the political newsletters clogging your inbox
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.360]   with their hot takes and tired infighting.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.680]   This might be more of a DC thing.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.160]   I don't know, Jesse, this might be something that normal people don't do, but here in DC,
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.880]   people subscribe to email newsletters that have all these insider hot takes on political
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.880]   stuff.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.960]   I mean, there's so many of them around here because there's so many political experts
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.440]   here and this is a good business or job for them or whatever.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:24.120]   If you subscribe to these, so you get like the Silver Bulletin or, you know, Jonah Goldberg
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.800]   or whatever it is, this is a good time to temporarily take a break.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:34.480]   We're trying to, again, get away from this content and subject matter that we're associating
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.120]   with being burnt out, with being drained.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.040]   Again, we're not, we're coming back to this.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.040]   We're not putting these people out of business.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.040]   We're taking a break.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.040]   All right.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:48.000]   Finally, this is the most either confusing or most controversial, so I'm going to read
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.200]   here specifically.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:56.920]   I suggest you switch to a slower pace of media consumption with the formats that remain.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.680]   Don't laugh at this suggestion because I'm actually serious.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.920]   Consider picking up the occasional old-fashioned printed newspaper free from algorithmic optimization
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.000]   and clickbait curation at your local coffee shop or library to check in all at once on
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.880]   anything major going on in the world.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.600]   I think I might set up a Sunday only paper subscription as my main source of news for
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.080]   the rest of the fall.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.920]   So you want to get some news still, I think that's fine.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:28.720]   It's also would be stressful to be cut off completely from the world during a time, especially
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.680]   in our country, of the turmoil of a post-election period, especially like a highly fraught election
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.920]   like we just went through.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.160]   But I'm saying we are slowing down that consumption is what I'm suggesting.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.680]   We're not on social media.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.680]   We're not getting in newsletters.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.680]   We're not getting in podcasts.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.360]   I'm saying pick up a newspaper.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.080]   I say coffee shop because, I don't know if you've seen this Jesse, Starbucks sells newspapers.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.960]   It's interesting, they're there, right?
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.040]   Your library has the newspaper every day.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.600]   So like any day you could walk by the library and sit down and read the front page of the
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.600]   newspaper.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:04.360]   I am, I don't get any paper newspaper, but I am considering signing up for a Sunday only
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.200]   paper subscription for the near future.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:14.040]   And for me, I will read section A of that paper on Sundays.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.400]   This gives you the news.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   You will be up to date.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.960]   In fact, you will be more up to date on the news of the country and the world doing that
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:28.520]   than someone who's on their phone all the time because the newspaper is not algorithmic.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:34.880]   A newspaper has no way of customizing what you see on the front page to your particular
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.320]   interest and therefore keeping out of your sight stuff that you don't have a preexisting
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.320]   interest in.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.660]   They just show you the articles.
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:49.280]   You are going to see what's happening in Turkey, for example, and Kurdistan and the missile
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.280]   barrages.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.400]   You might not have ever heard about that because it's not big on social media.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.280]   You're going to hear about it, right?
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.800]   You're going to hear more digested takes, okay?
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.600]   It's like this is covering, I don't need to be TikTok up to the beat on all the back and
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.680]   forth between the new administration and the old administration in America.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.280]   Why don't I just read an article about what was the most important thing that happened?
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.400]   Oh, they had an argument about this.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.400]   I see it.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.400]   I hear their quotes.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.680]   Now I'm done.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.640]   You're taking in news.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.000]   You're not less informed, but the footprint of this news on your day-to-day attentional
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:43.440]   landscape is now greatly reduced.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:56.320]   All right, that's my suggestion about what to take out of your life.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.680]   What should you then do with the newfound free attention?
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.600]   I don't even say free time so much as free attention.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:08.120]   What you're freeing up here is attention autonomy when you're not constantly looking at the
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.120]   phone.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.120]   What you do with this?
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:16.920]   Well, in the article I talk about, I'll read it here, equally important is how you redirect
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.360]   your newly liberated attention.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:26.440]   Consider aiming it toward real community with real people who actually live near you to
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:31.160]   retrain your brain to stop thinking of the world as hopelessly fractured into vicious
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.760]   tribes.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.760]   And I say in the article, and I guess I should say this right now on the podcast, but if
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:44.400]   right now you're scouring this post to seek evidence as to whether I'm friend or foe,
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.160]   then you're already severely suffering from this malady.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.120]   When you're online, it's all about the bad and the good.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.000]   And not just the bad and the good, but making sure that you're sufficiently signaling to
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.520]   your team that you're on their team.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.080]   This becomes the most important thing.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:04.140]   And to make your team's boundaries stronger, you have to make the other team be defined
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:09.640]   increasingly dire and irredeemable.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.000]   That becomes your reality.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.120]   When you're on that digital world, that becomes your reality.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.120]   You have a hate in your heart for people you've never met.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.520]   You see people, when you're on social media so much, you see people that are suspicious.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.520]   What team are they on?
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.000]   And I'm looking for signs to try to signify it.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:36.480]   You'd be surprised or maybe not by how much sort of upset I would say communication I
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:42.800]   get about why aren't you specifically signaling your allegiance to this particular issue I
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.120]   care about.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.300]   You not signaling publicly allegiance to the thing I care about to me, to the people writing
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.280]   in is very difficult for them.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.240]   That is a weird mindset.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:58.880]   Until like 10 years ago, it is a weird way to go through the world.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:04.680]   You wouldn't walk into the supermarket in 1985 and be like, "You better tell me whether
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.440]   or not you voted for Reagan, and if you didn't vote for Reagan, why aren't you going around
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.820]   talking about how much of a supporter of Jimmy Carter you are?"
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:16.280]   It's a weird thing that digital media created, and we don't realize it's overcoming our world.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:21.440]   So go spend time with real people, people you can see, people that you live with, doing
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.560]   things with them that's unrelated to like whatever fights are going on online, it rewires
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.720]   your perception of the world.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.640]   People who spend time with real people in real situations have a lot harder time seeing
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:39.400]   the world through a lens of hatred, because that's how we're wired to live, we're wired
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.400]   to cooperate.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:46.200]   We talked about the Morris book "Tribal" when I did my roundup of books I read last month,
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.160]   he argues that the human tribal instinct is one of actual cooperation, that's what allowed
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:57.160]   Homo sapiens to succeed, is that we can cooperate and empathize with people that we don't know,
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.660]   they're not in our close family or kin, and that's what allowed Homo sapiens to succeed
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:07.480]   at a global level where other closely related hominid species did not, because they basically
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.480]   just treated everyone.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.960]   They had no way of cooperating with people that wasn't direct kin, they would just kill
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:17.680]   them, and so like the Neanderthals could never actually grow large trade networks or cities
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.200]   or the types of things Homo sapiens do, lean into that human instinct, be around real people,
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.080]   it will really retrain, you'll just feel happier, you'll feel less upset.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.040]   Another suggestion, consider reading books again.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.320]   There's a pleasure in the conquest of deep ideas that's been lost as we thrashed in digital
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.560]   sea of churning distraction.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:44.960]   Books slow down your mind, books give you a deeper understanding of issue than you'll
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:51.000]   get online, books challenge your perceptions or sharpen and sophisticate your understandings
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.120]   and beliefs in ways they couldn't before, books change the way you understand the world.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.440]   So go back to reading more books, books about whatever, just as a principle, but also if
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:09.720]   you're having a strong reaction to the election, the right way in my opinion to try to make
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:16.080]   sense, you feel like you don't understand the world, you don't understand our country.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:23.880]   The right way to make sense of things is not trying to sift through 50,000 hot takes or
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.880]   500 different podcast interviews with people pontificating and hope that sort of out of
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:37.480]   that morass of like highly engaging, random attention seeking content, better understanding
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.480]   will come.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:45.600]   It's, I think, the slow encounter with relevant ideas and books are the way to do it.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.600]   Read books you think are going to help you better understand what's going on in your
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:54.360]   country and it's a slower, it feels meaningful.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:02.520]   I went through this in 2016, I remember doing this very clearly, that simpler time, 2016
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.520]   Jesse.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:09.000]   So remember we're coming out of eight years of Obama, you know, hope, red, blue.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.840]   And if you were, you know, living in a coastal city and you're like an academic, like I was,
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   like everything's great.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.840]   Everyone's happy.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.840]   Obama's awesome.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.160]   There's like some weird tea party people, but I think they just like tri-corner hats
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.840]   and like that was just our world.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:30.680]   And then so the 2016 Trump victory, much more so I think than the 2024 one was super surprising.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:35.640]   And I remember having this feeling, it's just, you know, I've East coast intellectual my
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.640]   whole life of bafflement.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.360]   I remember that like, I don't understand.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.240]   I'm a Obama supporter, read the New York times.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.280]   I don't understand how anyone could vote for Donald Trump.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.220]   I remember having this bafflement, right?
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:53.000]   Because I just had never been exposed to, you know, whatever that part, what was going
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   on.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.840]   I had no empathy with the mindset.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:05.820]   And so what I did, because I'm a nerd this way, is I got a bunch of books, I got a bunch
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:06.820]   of books.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.820]   And I was like, I'm going to read.
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.980]   And I read on the left and the right, all like center left, center right stuff, right?
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.900]   Because I like reactionary far right stuff is not interesting to me.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.820]   And I wasn't that interested in like far left type stuff or whatever, but I was reading.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:24.420]   And I don't remember, I remember some of the books, but not like I remember reading.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:29.180]   Like Thomas Franks had this book called Listen Liberal that was talking about the evolution
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:33.220]   of the Democratic Party from its working class coalition.
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:39.540]   And then in the post Nixon era, how it moved and realigned around more like salaried economic
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.540]   elites like lawyers and had, you know, financiers and how this happened sort of during the Clinton
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.140]   era.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.380]   And this movement happened in part because the Democratic Party was upset with their
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:56.620]   working class base because of support for Vietnam and lack of support for civil rights.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.620]   And it was like interesting.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.140]   I was, I read some, Yuval Levin had a book coming from the center right.
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.260]   I remember reading that book.
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:07.260]   I was reading these books to try to understand like how did the modern right feel?
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.260]   What had happened?
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.260]   What's going on with the modern left?
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:15.980]   I remember it was very calming because reading is slow and it calms the nervous system and
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:23.860]   you feel like the structures of knowledge are complicating themselves and it feels productive,
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:28.740]   but it's sort of a emotional and in some sense for me it was very helpful.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:35.380]   I remember it was like something to do and what I learned, it also changed, like it changed
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:40.540]   my perception of the world in ways that I think was useful for me.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.440]   The world became a more complicated place in a way that I think was useful.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:50.540]   So anyways, books, read, don't scroll, read, don't scroll, that's the right way.
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.380]   Same if you're on the right as well.
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.500]   Let's say like you're super celebratory or this or that.
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:08.260]   It's gratuitous to just say I'm going to just bathe in people dunking online.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.980]   Understand what's going on with my party, what is the potential positive future, what
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:20.740]   are the traps to avoid, what's happening, read and get into the complexity of what's
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.620]   going on.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:33.100]   Reading slows things down, it makes the world richer, it gets rid of the pot nerves.
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.260]   People in a library are not stressed, being around books is not stressful, so I suggest
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.500]   reading.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.780]   Final suggestion from the book, spend more time in nature to discover that despite the
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:49.420]   apocalyptic tenor of the online world, its analog counterpart persists and is beautiful.
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:58.460]   We feel good when we're in nature, sunshine, walking a nature trail, it just resets our
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:03.580]   nervous systems which have been artificially put out of whack because of the digital.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:10.380]   Go outside, go outside this fall, go outside this winter.
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.380]   That makes a big difference.
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.020]   All right, so there are my advice, right?
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.740]   So okay, quick summary, the suggestions of what to temporarily walk away from, social
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:24.940]   media, political podcasts, political newspapers, and to move to slower media consumption, things
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:30.420]   to do to fill this newly liberated attention, read books, meet real people, and spend more
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.500]   time outside.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.020]   Now how long should we do this?
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.380]   Because again, I said I'm not talking about a permanent disconnect from like political
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.740]   news sources.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:46.660]   Here is the good news about the American election schedule.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.620]   We do these elections in November, but nothing changes till January, right?
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.860]   So there's no like to do in other countries.
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:59.860]   We have this election in November, next week, you know, the new person takes over.
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.820]   So like we, and whether we're like worried or celebrating this new person, we really
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.680]   want to be up to date on like what's happening, what they're doing, it really matters.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.200]   We have in the American system this break.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:15.220]   Nothing can really happen between November and January except for pontification.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:20.940]   Nothing can really happen except for the search for clicks, except for the challenge online
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:25.940]   to win the attention curation tournament.
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.380]   So take a break till the new year.
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.300]   I think that's the right timing.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.600]   You're not missing much.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.460]   You got holidays that are centered on family.
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.900]   We got Thanksgiving.
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.900]   We got Christmas.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:41.020]   I'm not sure if you know this, but Hanukkah is starting on the same, on Christmas day
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.780]   or Christmas Eve or Christmas day.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.780]   Oh really?
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:44.780]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.500]   So it's a rare, a rare confluence of those two things.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.500]   We got that going on.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:55.780]   We got more importantly than all three of those, baseball hot stove season.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.640]   Juan Soto is meeting with Steve Cohen, everyone.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.820]   This is something you could be paying attention to right now.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.820]   I think that's good to pay attention to.
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:07.420]   Someone actually wrote me back, Jesse, when I posted this newsletter and they wrote me
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.620]   back of like, yeah, I've been doing this.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.400]   And a lot of people actually, by the way, they wrote me back and said they started this
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.900]   like a few weeks before the election.
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.900]   They were just done.
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:17.900]   Right.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.340]   And they're kind of in a happier place than any of us right now, probably.
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.020]   But someone wrote back and they were like, I've been doing it for two weeks, but one
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.980]   of the things I've been struggling with is sports news.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.340]   And I was like, oh no, no, no, that's, that's good.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.980]   Actually you want to spend time with sports news.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.260]   That's the solution to healing because I need my baseball trade rumors.
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.260]   All right.
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.860]   So do it for the, do it for the fall.
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.780]   And then the new year you can reevaluate.
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.780]   If you want to reevaluate smartly, maybe reread my book, Digital Minimalism, and it'll talk
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.060]   about how to, how to reenter technology into your life after a break.
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.220]   But the main thing I want to suggest is just take this political break and then do this
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.580]   act of alternative activities.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:56.740]   Do this pretty hardcore for the rest of November, for all December, just let your body reset,
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:01.740]   let your mind reset and revisit the world of politics in a more serious way in the new
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.740]   year.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:08.360]   So let me end this deep dive by reading the paragraph that ended this article.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:14.480]   The Republic will still stand without our constant digital vigilance, but it's unclear
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.780]   if our mental health can survive the status quo.
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.060]   And I really believe that.
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.060]   So let's all unplug.
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.340]   Time to take a break.
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.220]   I have a couple of follow-up questions.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.220]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.460]   What I think about the Met's chance of signing Juan Soto.
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.060]   It's a good question.
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.140]   Pretty strong actually.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.140]   I think.
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.140]   I think you'll spend whatever.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.140]   Yeah.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.140]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.140]   I agree.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.140]   I think it's a good time though.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.320]   And at least it's like we get to see Harper a lot still.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.320]   So I guess that'd be fun.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.720]   The thing that Mad Dog always says is how the free agency takes so long in baseball.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.200]   It's so drawn out and it's like horrible.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.000]   But anyway, did you use chat GPT to make that image?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   I could tell.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   I was just messing around with that.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.600]   Isn't it creepy?
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.720]   They all look the same, but I could tell you probably put like, I want a voting sticker
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.720]   and then like.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.720]   I just curious.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.760]   I was just curious.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.380]   I don't think I'll be using chat GPT for most images in the world because here, let me load
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.380]   this on the screen.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.960]   If people are watching, I'll make it big.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.160]   It's so creepy.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.160]   They all look the same.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.160]   You can tell.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.360]   But let me show you like the things that are creepy.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.560]   Like yeah, there's an I voted sticker, but the font is weird, right?
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:26.360]   Like it's kind of weird and gothic and there's someone reading, but her face looks weird.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:31.000]   Like when I look at this picture, so if you're just listening, there's a young woman reading
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.500]   a book by a Creek with an I voted sticker on conceptually.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.200]   This is like a good image for this article.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.520]   Like you, you, because the, the thing, the title was after you vote on plug.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.680]   So it's like, I went from voting to I'm reading a book by a Creek.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:50.200]   But everything about this picture screams that if that, that young woman turned slowly
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:55.040]   to look at the camera, she would like her mouth would be sewed shut and her eyes would
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.040]   be red.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:07.140]   Like just, you feel like this is the setup of a creepy scene in like a Blumhouse movie
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:13.260]   or that she's just like that, like she's just reading there and it zooms out and it's just
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.260]   corpses everywhere.
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.820]   Like, don't you get that sense?
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:17.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:18.820]   She's on a mountain of corpses.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:24.700]   Um, she, she zooms out and like, uh, there's some sort of like dinosaur in the water.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.900]   I don't know, man, AI makes creepy pictures.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.180]   Uh, a couple other quick questions.
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.900]   I thought you did get the newspaper every day.
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.820]   I used to, we used to get the post.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.820]   Okay.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.820]   You stopped that.
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.820]   We weren't keeping up.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.820]   Okay.
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:38.820]   It was too much news.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.820]   And then it was, it was feeling wasteful.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:44.220]   Um, next up when you do reconnect, what news podcast do you listen to?
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.340]   I feel like our audience would be curious.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:51.740]   Well, I don't do news roundup podcasts because, um, we used to get the paper.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.460]   I usually just read the paper online.
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:59.740]   Um, but I do like some of like the different news commentary podcast.
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:00.740]   Like what?
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:05.060]   Well, so the thing I do typically is I'm often chasing guests.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.620]   So I'm interested in particular guests.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:12.620]   Um, but I do like listening to center right, center left commentary podcast because I feel
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:17.820]   like those, you read a balance of those, you get a really good, like kind of a non-polemical
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.420]   understanding of what's going on and it's sort of good to try to balance those two.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:26.060]   It's like a good center right podcast would be like listening to Andrew Sullivan, you
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:31.140]   know, he used to editor of the new Republic, used to write for New York magazine, has a
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:38.220]   British accent, which makes them like 25% smarter, which is like, it's true.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.900]   I was just, you know, we've joking about it, but like Oliver Berkman on the show, that
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:47.300]   accent gave him 20 IQ points because he's like, Oh yes, profound, profound.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.700]   Um, so, you know, things like that are interesting.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.420]   Uh, I think, I think of Ezra Klein as center left, you know, very policy focused.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.140]   So I'm brilliant guy, brilliant interviewer.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:03.220]   So if you take like Sullivan and Klein and sort of like those are good, you're going
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.060]   to get kind of a, an interesting balance tank.
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.620]   Sometimes like Sam Harris will have on, um, interesting, especially when Sam Harris is
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.300]   doing like technology, I think is really interesting.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:18.620]   He has that way of just slowly trying to break down and understand what's going on.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.820]   And so, um, I'll listen to the, his sometimes, who else do I listen to?
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.820]   Yeah.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.820]   That's a good question.
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.860]   I don't do a ton of political content, but I'm missing some, there's definitely more.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.860]   There's definitely more.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:31.860]   I listened to sometimes.
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:32.860]   Cool.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:37.820]   And then lastly, with the newsletters, I remember when I was just started listening to your
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.460]   podcast, when you started, I used to have a lot of newsletters, but now I trimmed like
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.460]   a lot of them.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.300]   So I'm very selective about my newsletters that come into my box inbox.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.300]   I think that's probably good.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.300]   You mainly need mine.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.860]   Um, mine has been like very sporadic recently.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.100]   Uh, I do, my plan is to go back.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.260]   There should be a weekly, I want to write my, my newsletter weekly.
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.660]   So I'm, I'm working on some schedule template changes that's going to make that possible.
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.900]   I'm not quite there.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.660]   Um, I would like to be there for the New Year's.
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.460]   I think more than once a week is like too much.
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.820]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:12.820]   That's what I'm going for.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.500]   I might have some sort of more synergy, but like we did today where I write a newsletter
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.540]   on something to really organize my thoughts and then I can use that as the foundation
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.820]   for a deep dive on the podcast.
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.460]   I'm thinking about doing something like that.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.500]   Uh, but I'm not, I'm not quite there.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.500]   Not quite there yet.
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.500]   I just have so much writing.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.500]   I do.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.500]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.500]   And you know, I just have a lot more writing.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.500]   I use the newsletter.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.540]   I, what I probably need to go back to is I used to write the newsletter in the evening,
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.260]   but it's because my, I had babies before.
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:42.140]   So like they would go to bed at, you know, 630 and then I could just choose one night
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.140]   a week.
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.140]   I'd sit in the big leather chair.
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.380]   Long-time listeners know about the big leather chair and sit in the big leather chair, put
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.260]   on a record, write my newsletter is like nice and meditative.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.900]   But now my kids are like staying up later than I am.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.900]   Yeah.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.340]   And it's just, I'm just like, that's not as much of an option anymore, so I got to figure
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.340]   this out.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.300]   Uh, but yeah, be selective with newsletters.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.140]   Uh, definitely like you subscribe to the newsletter for the election cycle.
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.880]   It's unsubscribed left and right, but Nate Silver was very clever.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.900]   It's not super clever, but a smart move.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:15.020]   You know, Nate Silver, the election forecaster, he turned off as we got to the fall, he turned
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.540]   off month, monthly subscriptions.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.460]   Oh, he's like, I only have annual subscriptions because he knew like a lot of people, like
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:25.780]   all I really care about is your discussions of your model in the lead up to the election.
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.060]   So he's like, fine, but you still have to subscribe for a whole year, which is smart
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.620]   because then when you finally get around to, okay, now I can finally unsubscribe.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:37.340]   He's like, there's like some other like midterm, like another election happening.
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.300]   So we'll see.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.420]   All right.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.500]   So that's it for the deep dive.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.700]   We got some good questions coming up.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.400]   We're covering a lot of topics in those questions.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.540]   But first, let's hear from one of our sponsors.
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:52.140]   I want to talk in particular about our friends at Notion.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:56.020]   Notion combines your notes, docs, and projects into one space that's simple and beautifully
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.020]   designed.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:03.100]   And now we have the new Notion AI, which has the capabilities of multiple AI tools built
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:09.700]   in, which means you can search, generate, analyze, and chat all inside Notion.
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:16.020]   Now here's the thing, if you don't know Notion, you're not a sufficiently intense productivity
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.700]   information flow geek like I am.
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:22.420]   It's this fantastic, super flexible tool for organizing your information, accessing your
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:26.780]   information, seeing your information in sort of different types of views.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.940]   You can organize tasks, track your habits, write beautiful docs, collaborate with your
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:30.940]   team.
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.940]   We used to have this system with one of our ad agencies before where, and I've mentioned
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:38.780]   this on the show, they built this great interface for us for dealing with ad reads where we
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.440]   could see the same data from many different forms.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.780]   So I could say, for example, what are the ad reads we need to do on the show being recorded
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.040]   on this day?
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.180]   Or we could click on one of those particular advertisers and say, actually, I want to see
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:55.260]   all of the ad reads that we have scheduled for that particular advertiser.
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.480]   When we were on the view for a particular show, we could click on a particular read
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.740]   and enter in the information about, hey, what's the timestamp?
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.860]   And all this information gets stored in a cool place.
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.620]   You can build these sort of custom information systems that could be enterprise level or
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:12.420]   just you dealing with some complicated project you have.
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:16.060]   But this key new feature in Notion that I'm talking about here is how they've integrated
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.060]   AI with Notion AI.
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.580]   It makes all of this even better.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.300]   The new Notion AI is a single tool that does it all.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.780]   You can search across Notion and other apps.
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.700]   You can generate text and docs in your own style.
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.700]   You can analyze PDFs and images.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:36.020]   You can chat with the system about your own information or what you want to do.
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:41.980]   It just makes it so much simpler to use this tool and so much more flexible.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.860]   A couple of things to emphasize.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.780]   Notion AI is designed to protect your privacy.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:53.460]   Notion's AI partners are contractually prohibited from using your data to train their models.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.780]   Notion AI also respects the permissions of your content, so it will only reference content
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.780]   that you have access to.
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.540]   Second, it uses multiple models to give you the best results.
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.020]   Notion AI will draw from both GPT-4 and Cloud.
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.900]   It will chat with you about any topic.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:14.420]   It can search across thousands of docs in seconds, answer questions about your own information.
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:19.340]   There's this new beta feature called AI Connectors, which allows it to search across other apps
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:24.260]   that are relevant, like Slack discussions, Google Docs, etc.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.500]   So try Notion for free when you go to notion.com/cal.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:36.460]   Do that in all lowercase letters—notion.com/cal—to try the powerful, easy-to-use Notion AI today.
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:40.620]   When you use our link, you're supporting our show.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.620]   That's notion.com/cal.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:45.220]   I also want to talk about our friends at Cozy Earth.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:49.580]   Look, I'm telling you, its gift season is coming up.
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:56.220]   Buy people you care about Cozy Earth products, in particular my favorite, the Cozy Earth
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.220]   sheets.
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   I have told you this.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.660]   I'm obsessed with Cozy Earth.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:02.900]   We have multiple pairs of Cozy Earth sheets because they are the most comfortable sheets
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.080]   we've ever had.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.300]   We used to mourn when those sheets were being washed and we had to put just regular sheets
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.300]   on our bed.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.020]   We would mourn it.
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:17.180]   So we bought enough pairs so that we would never have to have a week without Cozy Earth
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.300]   sheets on our bed.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:25.240]   The fabric is so comfortable, it's breathable, it's soft, it sleeps cool.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:30.340]   We also have the Cozy Earth comforter duvet cover.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.340]   Very soft.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:36.580]   I have Cozy Earth sweatshirt, which has this like really comfortable, almost cooling sensation,
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.300]   which I love when I'm exercising in it.
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.460]   We have the Cozy Earth towels.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.700]   My wife has the Cozy Earth PJs.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:46.000]   We really are big Cozy Earth boosters because I don't know how they make this fabric.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.800]   But it is just the most comfortable stuff we have.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.500]   We've given Cozy Earth sheets as gifts.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.480]   So anyways, gift-giving season, you got Chris McCaw coming up.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.000]   Order these sheets or any of the other products now.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.440]   I am a big believer.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.540]   And there's also nice stuff, too.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:08.160]   They're responsibly produced, they have 10-year warranties, etc., etc.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.720]   All right, so wrap the ones you love in luxury with Cozy Earth.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.080]   We have a good deal here to offer.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.080]   Trust me, you need the deal.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.160]   You want to bring the price down if you can.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:25.860]   Visit CozyEarth.com/Deep and use my exclusive 40% off code "Deep" to give the gift of luxury
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.860]   this holiday season.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.860]   That's CozyEarth.com/Deep.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:33.780]   And if you get that post-purchase survey, take a second to say you heard about Cozy
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.920]   Earth from Deep Questions podcast.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.380]   That really helps me because they know you came from me.
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.340]   All right, Jesse, I think we're ready for some questions.
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.460]   Who do we got first?
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.420]   First question comes from Rebecca.
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.820]   With several years' worth of emails, notes, and files spread across various formats and
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:54.260]   locations, how can I best approach consolidating this information without succumbing to overwhelm?
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.420]   I mean, you should use Notion.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.980]   We should add it for Notion.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.380]   Move it on there, but use my promo code.
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:07.420]   OK, so here's my typical thought for organizing information.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.060]   You need a digital and physical filing cabinet.
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.300]   Physical filing cabinet's obvious.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.300]   It's a literal thing.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.300]   It's a filing cabinet.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:19.620]   There's manila folders within bigger hanging folders, and you put actual pieces of paper
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.180]   in there.
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.600]   Digital filing cabinets is like a particular directory tree within your computer where
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.620]   you store information that you want to keep.
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:34.140]   So like on my computer, the folder is called administrative, and then underneath that,
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.380]   I have all sorts of subfolders for various things.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:41.420]   Like here is stuff related, like digital files related to tax filings.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:47.100]   There's stuff related to important Georgetown contracts or whatever, right?
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.260]   So digital, treat it like a physical filing cabinet.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.580]   You have a particular digital filing cabinet.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.420]   I believe in encrypted backup of digital filing cabinets.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:38:01.020]   I use Dropbox, and so it's automatically synced and stored encrypted on the Dropbox server.
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.460]   So if my computer is destroyed or lost, I'm not losing those important files.
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:10.580]   I can access them online, and I can re-sync those files to a new computer when I get it.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:14.020]   If something is important, it should go in one of those two things.
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.380]   So like you say here, like what do I do with a year's worth of emails?
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.380]   Well, nothing.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:21.700]   Most emails, if you just have them stored in your inbox, they're just in your inbox.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.660]   I don't treat that particularly special.
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:28.460]   If there's a particular piece of information that arrived in an email that's important,
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:32.740]   print it and put it in a proper folder in your physical filing cabinet, or export it
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:38.420]   as a PDF and put it in an appropriate file within your digital filing folders.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:43.100]   What I mean by export it, well, technically speaking, the way I take things like emails
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:49.380]   and I store them, you just go to print, like you're printing it, and then when you select
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:56.380]   a printer, at least the way it works on Mac, you can say open in preview or print the PDF,
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.180]   and so it just takes like whatever would have printed and it puts it in a PDF file, and
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:02.180]   you can just save that and move it into the filing cabinet, right?
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.580]   So just have one digital, one physical.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.120]   Notice you don't have to replicate between the two.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.660]   Some stuff can be, that's fine, right?
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:14.060]   Like maybe someone sends you as a PDF a contract, and you throw it in your digital, but you
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.460]   printed it to sign it, and maybe you want to store the printed, but you don't have to
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.860]   duplicate between the two, but that's where important stuff goes.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:24.380]   Nothing else is a trusted storage system to use the terminology from David Allen.
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:29.040]   So if something arrives in your email that's important, it is not stored until it's in
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.340]   one of those cabinets, digital or physical.
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:36.020]   Someone gives you a paper, it comes through the mailbox, you get mail to form a tax form
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:39.860]   or contract or whatever, it is not stored until you have it in a folder in your physical
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:45.620]   mailing cabinet or in your digital file storage, either one of those two things, all right?
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:49.940]   So just simplify where things can be stored physical and stored digital, and don't consider
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.580]   things stored until it's in one of those places.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.820]   Everything else you don't have to stress about.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.860]   Like if you have a bunch of emails archived in Gmail, who cares?
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.780]   The key stuff has been put in one of those folders.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:02.380]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:07.020]   First question is from Anonymous, "How can I go out on my own when my company has a strict
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:11.300]   confluence of interest policy preventing you from performing my craft on the side?
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.860]   I'm a high performer and objectively good at my craft, but would eventually like to
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.700]   start my own indie business.
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:20.220]   This goes directly against your advice to prove that you can make money doing something
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:24.420]   before quitting, leaving your day job to pursue your own venture."
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.920]   So the specific advice that Anonymous is talking about comes from my book, So Good They Can't
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:33.980]   Ignore You, where I said, "Use money as a neutral indicator of value," and the specific
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:42.020]   advice was to know if what you want to do, let's say it's like a new job, is valuable.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.940]   See if you can get people to give you money for it.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.780]   The key idea here is that people are happy to give you verbal praise or affirmation.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.620]   It costs them nothing, and it seems like the pleasant, sociable thing to do.
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.700]   "Hey, that's a great idea.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:55.780]   Your business idea is great.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:56.780]   You should just go for it.
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:57.780]   I wish I could do that.
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:58.940]   You're definitely going to be successful."
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.940]   That means nothing, right?
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.420]   They might not know anything about it, or they're just trying to be nice.
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.340]   But people do not like to give you their money.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:09.700]   So you're like, "Okay, can I sell enough of this thing to support myself, and then
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.820]   I no longer do my job?"
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.720]   Well, if you can't, people aren't willing to give you your money for the thing you're
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:17.780]   selling, then it's not good enough for you to make a living on it.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.980]   "Can I get a big enough book?
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.980]   Can I get a big book advance on this book idea?
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.580]   If not, then maybe it's not the great book idea I thought it was," et cetera.
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.540]   So that's what we mean by money as a neutral indicator of value.
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:33.100]   So the person asking the question here is saying, "But I can't go and try my thing
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.620]   on the side because I signed a contract."
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.620]   Well, that's true.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:36.620]   You can't.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:41.260]   If you signed a contract that says, "Look, I am a writer for this magazine, and I'm not
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:45.300]   allowed to write for these other magazines while I'm here," then yeah, you can't go
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.540]   write for other magazines while you're here, right?
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:49.540]   Contract is a contract.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.020]   "Can you still apply the advice, though?"
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:54.540]   Yes, in a couple of very specific ways.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.580]   And the main way is a job offer.
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:02.380]   If you don't like your current job and you want to bring your skills somewhere else where
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:08.460]   the setup better fits your lifestyle-centric planning vision, you're allowed to go solicit
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:10.020]   job offers.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:15.620]   If someone says, "We will pay you this much money for you to come work for us," that's
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.340]   a fantastic neutral indicator of value.
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.620]   "Oh, my skills are valued by them.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.980]   Now I can quit my job and go take that other job."
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:28.740]   So you can actually just go out to the marketplace and see if in the other type of work you want
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:34.020]   to do with your skills that's better going to fit your lifestyle, can you get a job offer
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.280]   that is sufficiently large.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.500]   That's also using money as a neutral indicator of value, right?
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.100]   And that'd probably be the main thing you could do in a situation like that.
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.740]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.780]   Did I make you sign a conflict of interest?
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:47.780]   I think I did.
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.780]   I said, "You're not allowed to."
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:49.780]   What would you be doing on this side?
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:50.780]   "You're not allowed to."
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:51.780]   We need an enemy podcast.
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:55.020]   I was going to say, "You're not allowed to produce podcast for."
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.540]   We don't have an enemy podcast.
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.540]   We need a nemesis.
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:01.740]   I don't know who the nemesis would be of our podcast.
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.980]   Maybe we should just choose someone famous.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.980]   Joe Rogan?
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:06.980]   Joe Rogan.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.780]   His podcast is so big.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:12.700]   You are not allowed to go produce Joe Rogan's podcast.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.700]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.260]   I put it in a contract.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:20.060]   Although I was listening to him and Elon the other day, and I guess Jamie does play a lot
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:21.060]   of golf.
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.460]   That's a pretty good job.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.680]   And you already have a similar name.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.180]   If he just started saying Jesse instead of Jamie, how many people do you think would
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.180]   really notice?
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.660]   Casual listeners are like, "Yeah."
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:33.660]   You never see his face.
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.860]   You don't know what he looks like.
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.860]   He kind of looks like you.
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.820]   He's tall, and I think he has blonde hair.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.580]   And he plays golf.
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.500]   If you've been wondering, it is true.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.300]   Jesse is the same as Jamie from the Joe Rogan podcast.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:52.100]   He probably makes a ton of money doing that because he makes like $30 million a year.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.100]   I hope so.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.100]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.100]   I mean, I really do.
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.100]   Probably more than that.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.100]   That's their whole...
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:04.060]   My main inspiration I derive from Joe Rogan, other than taking lots of human growth hormone,
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.700]   is he kept his operations small.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:12.540]   His biggest staffing, the biggest staffing he has is actually security.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.620]   It really is him and Jamie.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.740]   Just knowing from, I know a lot of people who know him or have been on his show, it's
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:27.700]   like Jamie does the things and puts the files online and runs it, and that's it.
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:32.980]   And then Joe books, he kind of just texts guests specifically.
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.700]   So how you get on the Joe Rogan podcast, from what I understand, never been on the show,
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:41.380]   but I know lots of people who have, is typically someone you know in common will reach out
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.140]   and be like, "Can I give your phone number to Joe?"
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:47.580]   And then he'll just text you and be like, "Hey, man, can we chat?"
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.460]   And then he'll talk to you on the phone and be like, "This could be cool.
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.460]   I think we should talk."
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.140]   And then that's that.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.460]   I think they have someone who does travel booking or something, but...
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:56.940]   When you go on the show, can you use the gym?
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.380]   Don't they have a sick gym at their studio?
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:59.380]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.340]   But my worry would be you use it before.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:03.140]   I'd probably do it both.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.140]   And then you're just like...
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.140]   Spend the whole day there?
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:06.140]   Pouring sweat.
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.140]   You're just in there.
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.140]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:13.180]   You're just vomiting into a bucket, just pouring sweat.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.420]   Ripped my pec muscle.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:18.220]   I have an arrow through my shoulder because I was trying to like...
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.940]   He does a lot of like El Conti, and I have an arrow through my shoulder.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:21.940]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.180]   That's not going to go well.
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:27.820]   Not going to go well.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.500]   But yes, Jesse is not allowed.
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.500]   I'm putting my foot down.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:33.520]   He's not allowed to produce Joe Rogan's podcast and mine, right?
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:38.600]   You can't have two giants competing for the same attention.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:46.320]   There's only room in American cultural life for one of these two shows where both be myths.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:52.800]   I think between us, we do something like 5 million views a week between us and Joe Rogan's
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   podcast.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.240]   It's very powerful.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:05.400]   Between our episode on time block planning and Joe's episode where he interviewed Donald
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.680]   Trump, 200 million views combined.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.680]   All right?
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.000]   That's a lot of cultural power we have.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.320]   We can't...
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:16.880]   You put two alphas in a rink, right?
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.800]   You put two bulls in the same paddock, it's not going to work.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:20.800]   Sorry, Jesse.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:21.800]   We got to...
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.800]   You got to choose your allegiance.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:23.800]   You got to choose Joe Rogan.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:24.800]   All right.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:25.800]   Who do we got next?
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:26.800]   Next question is from Steven.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.360]   I'm a new listener and just finished your episode about the eight productivity books
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.920]   that can change your life.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.440]   What is humanist productivity?
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.360]   Oh, I like that episode.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.600]   I don't remember what...
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.860]   I remember maybe like half of what those books were.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.880]   That episode was from what, last year?
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.600]   I'll pull it up while you answer.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.600]   Okay.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.880]   So humanist productivity, I've been using that term or variations of that term for a
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:48.880]   while.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:53.800]   And I did a little interview about that on Brad Stolberg and Steve Magnus' and Clay Skipper's
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:54.800]   show.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.600]   I think it was titled like humanist productivity.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.600]   All right.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:00.600]   So what's the deal here?
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.600]   Well, what do we mean by productivity?
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:09.200]   There's two big definitions that have both explicitly and implicitly dominated sort of
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.480]   economic life.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:15.480]   And then there's humanist productivity, which is going to be a third option, which I think
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.480]   is better.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.080]   So the first definition of productivity is the oldest definition of productivity.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.840]   This emerges as an economic concept in the 18th century, comes out of agricultural production,
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.120]   and then moves on to industrial production.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.640]   And it's a ratio, the ratio of output per unit input.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:35.680]   So bushels of corn per acres of land cultivated.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:41.280]   Number of Model Ts produced per paid worker hour, right?
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:45.820]   In classic economics, typically the goal for anything that produces things is to increase
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.960]   that ratio as much as possible.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:53.440]   When you hear, for example, about a country's productivity or productivity growth, this
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.320]   is the style of productivity they're measuring.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.920]   So typically they'll measure the economic output of a sector and they'll divide it by
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.880]   the number of people who work in the sector.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.960]   So there it's like dollars generated per worker.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.880]   When that number goes up, productivity is up.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.360]   When that number goes down, productivity is down.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.360]   All right.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:15.820]   So ratio based productivity is the standard economic metric that's named productivity.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:20.580]   It was at the core of most of the economic growth that funded what we think of as the
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:23.100]   Western world today.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.220]   This is Peter Drucker's argument.
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:29.620]   This idea of we're measuring this carefully and we keep looking for innovations and technical
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:32.540]   processes that makes this ratio bigger.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:36.980]   And it just led to sort of like massive explosions in economic growth.
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:40.580]   But it's really something that discusses, it's relevant to production processes.
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:41.720]   All right.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:47.380]   So then knowledge work comes along, becomes a major sector in the 20th century.
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.980]   And this ratio based definition of productivity doesn't cleanly apply.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:51.980]   Why?
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:56.100]   Because a knowledge worker, someone who's sitting and working at a desk, doesn't just
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:59.060]   produce wheat or doesn't just produce Model Ts.
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.580]   There's not a clean output to measure.
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:04.740]   They work on many different things.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.780]   Many different projects, some internal, some external.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:09.540]   Often these projects are collaborative.
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.820]   So their role within the project is actually hard to actually separate or isolate.
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:15.940]   And so you don't have a ratio to measure anymore.
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:20.300]   I can't give you a number that for most knowledge work positions, it says here's your productivity
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.300]   number.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.300]   We want to go up and down.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.300]   So what did we do?
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.300]   We invented the second major notion of productivity.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.300]   And this was implicit.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:30.100]   No one really said this out loud until I came along with my book, Slow Productivity, where
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.300]   I make this big argument.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.820]   But we came up in the knowledge work space with what I call pseudo productivity.
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:40.500]   And it says, OK, if we can't explicitly manage or measure productivity because you're working
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:50.660]   on too many things, we will just use instead visible effort as a proxy for useful effort.
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.540]   The more you're doing, the better.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:56.860]   We can't kind of figure out what you're doing or what you're doing, like how much it matters
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.260]   or its direct impact on the bottom line.
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.380]   But more visible activity is better than less.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.100]   That's pseudo productivity.
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:10.060]   That has implicitly been how we managed knowledge work since, like, the 1950s.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:16.660]   In an age of offices you came to and typewriters, it worked OK.
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:18.780]   It's not a great measure, but it didn't cause a lot of problems.
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:20.220]   It just meant, like, you had to be at the office.
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:24.840]   And when you're at the office, you know, try to hide the fact that you're on your third
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:25.840]   martini of lunch, right?
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.340]   You know, just kind of be there, be doing stuff.
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.860]   Don't spend too much time at the water cooler.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.700]   Pseudo productivity went off the rails once we had the front office IT revolution, once
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.380]   we had email and then mobile computing.
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:43.740]   The problem was there was now no escape from opportunities to demonstrate activity because
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:47.140]   you could always be checking in on things, answering emails, working on work wherever
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:48.700]   you happen to be.
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:51.740]   And this is when knowledge work became exhausting.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:55.300]   It's when knowledge work eventually became deranging because now you as the individual
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:58.740]   had to constantly fight this battle between work and other things that are important to
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:50:59.740]   you in your life.
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:02.580]   The boundary was gone.
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.140]   Inequities became amplified.
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:09.260]   The 23-year-old with nothing going on can very easily just demonstrate visible activity
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:13.320]   by doing nonsense Slack and email answering late into the night, whereas the people with
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.780]   families or caring for sick relatives or just other things going on that are important to
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:19.140]   them in their life couldn't do this as much.
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:22.220]   And now they're suffering under this measure, even though the 23-year-old doing Slack in
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:26.140]   the middle of the night is not actually producing more value if you had a way to really measure
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.340]   that.
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.860]   So we had the ratio-based productivity followed by pseudo-productivity.
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.020]   Humanist productivity says, "No, no, no.
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:36.860]   The thing we want to optimize is your flourishing as a person."
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.380]   It's the type of productivity I talk about here on the show.
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.560]   The reason why I want you to take control over what you have to do and control over
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.060]   your time and attention is so that you are in control of your life.
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:49.300]   Once you're in control of your life, aim it towards where you want it to go.
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:54.460]   Now part of that is being on top of your work, being able to accomplish the stuff that not
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:58.140]   only helps you keep your job, but helps you shape your career in the directions that are
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:01.020]   compatible with your vision of an ideal lifestyle.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:05.420]   So this is a very important part of flourishing, but it allows you to do it on your own terms
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.980]   and to not have this take up all of your time, and to have other time to do other things
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:11.580]   and to make sure these other things are important to become a part of your life, to make sure
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:14.940]   your kids get what they need, that your soul gets what you need, that your community gets
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:17.880]   from you what it needs from a leadership perspective.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:25.260]   So I'm a big believer for the individual to deploy the tools of productivity we discuss
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.340]   towards human flourishing.
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:31.100]   And that is different than ratio-based productivity, which is trying to optimize output.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:35.920]   That's different than pseudo productivity, which is trying to optimize visible activity.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.020]   And so that's what we talk about here.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:40.780]   It is my response to the anti-productivity movement.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:47.020]   I think the anti-productivity movement tends to argue that like any discussion of productivity
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:51.860]   is about trying to move humans back towards this industrial ratio-based version of productivity.
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:53.980]   And I say it doesn't have to be.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:59.940]   The anti-productivity movement tries to make this sort of false binary choice.
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:04.380]   Either you become like the human equivalent of the Model T Assembly line where like we're
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:09.420]   trying to squeeze out as much production as possible, or your only other choice is to
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:15.940]   step away from productivity discourses and I guess write substacks about late stage capitalism.
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.380]   I said no, there's a third choice.
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:23.580]   Use the tools of productivity to build a life of human flourishing.
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:29.120]   Because here's the thing, pseudo productivity is extremely stressful.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:33.420]   Stepping away from any type of organizational thinking is also very stressful.
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.820]   You're going to be working more, you're going to be more stressed, you're going to be more
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:39.140]   frazzled, more frustrated, more upset.
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:42.980]   So the solution here is to learn the tools you need to control your tasks and time and
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.940]   production, but then you be in control of what you want to aim towards, and you should
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:47.620]   aim towards human flourishing.
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.620]   That's what humanism is about.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:51.260]   So we call it humanist productivity.
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:52.260]   I have the books.
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:53.260]   All right.
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.260]   What were the eight?
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:59.460]   Eight were "Seven Habits of Highly Effective People," "Getting Things Done," "Four Hour
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:07.180]   Work Week," "Essentialism," "4,000 Weeks," "How to Do Nothing," "Make Time," 168 hours.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:10.140]   And what was the episode number for that?
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:11.140]   265.
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:12.140]   Okay.
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:13.140]   So we're at what?
[00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:14.140]   Like 326?
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.140]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.140]   So that was a while ago.
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:22.340]   I have one more book I would now add to that list, which I think will be no surprise to
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:26.980]   our listeners, "Eruption" by Michael Crichton and James Patterson.
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:31.100]   Oh, man, that's funny.
[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:37.420]   Torah-esque in its wisdom for human living.
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:40.540]   I'm not happy about that book, folks.
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.060]   Michael Crichton is spinning in his grave.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.060]   All right.
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:44.420]   What do we got next?
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:45.940]   Next question is from Joel.
[00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:48.860]   I'm a software student and very distracted by my phone.
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:52.460]   I have an iPhone, an Apple Watch Ultra, and a flip phone.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:55.860]   What's your view on Apple Watches, and should I just use a flip phone in college?
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:59.340]   Look, here's what I'm going to suggest to you in college, and this is a general thing
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:05.800]   I often suggest to people, is when it comes to technology and its negative impact on certain
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:11.400]   things you're doing, the problem might be caused by technology, but you don't solve
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.280]   the problem solely with technology as well.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:20.980]   We kind of have this implicit techno-determinist narrative out there that the tools you own
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:24.180]   specify what the rhythms of your life is like.
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:26.960]   So if you want to change something you dislike about the rhythms of your life, like I'm very
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:31.340]   distracted when I'm studying, you have to change the tools you own.
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:38.160]   I argue no, no, change your behaviors, change your processes, change how you approach things.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:41.920]   Then the tools themselves probably won't matter that much.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:47.400]   If it's helpful, because of like a really strong addiction to a smartphone, to replace
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.520]   it with a non, if that's the only way to replace with a non-smartphone, it's like the only
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:53.440]   way you think you can break that addiction, okay, go ahead.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:57.080]   But keep in mind, I'm someone who is very non-distracted by the digital world, and I
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.440]   own a perfectly normal smartphone.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.620]   It's not the technology that matters, it's my rules and systems.
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:05.680]   So when it comes particularly to college, I've been arguing this now for almost two
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:06.680]   decades.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:10.120]   It's hard to believe it's been almost two decades since I published my first book.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.280]   Focus is a superpower.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:17.640]   If you are comfortable with and frequently deployed academic sessions with no context
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:22.360]   switching, so no quick checks of phone in any ways, text messages, social media, web,
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:27.760]   you just can focus without distraction, compared to your peers who are context shifting back
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:28.760]   and forth.
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.160]   It's like 50 IQ points.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.400]   It really will be like a superpower.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:38.360]   You'll finish your assignments like 2x faster, and your performance will be like 2x better.
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:41.400]   So how you do that, it's not so much what technology owns, it's about what your rules
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.400]   are.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.560]   So let me give you a few.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:49.760]   When you do studying, whether it's reading, working on problem sets, or writing, do it
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.600]   with zero connectivity.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.640]   Do not bring your phone.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.120]   You're in college, right?
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:57.800]   You're not the FEMA director.
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:00.960]   It'll be okay if you are unreachable for 90 minutes, all right?
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:03.340]   You got to get over yourself a little bit.
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.680]   Don't bring your phone.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.360]   Turn off the Wi-Fi on your computer.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:09.400]   Don't give me the whole thing about, "I need to use the internet to get the sources, and
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.800]   so therefore I have to look at TikTok on my phone while I study."
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.480]   If you need to use the internet, that's a separate session.
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:15.760]   Go gather everything you need on a separate session.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.680]   Bring your computer, turn off the Wi-Fi.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:20.000]   If it's something you could do without a computer, even better.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   Don't bring your phone with you.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.640]   Go to an out-of-the-way library.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.280]   Practice studying without connectivity.
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:26.600]   It'll be very hard at first.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.120]   As you get used to it, it's like taking the limitless pill.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:32.200]   You'll be like, "Wow, this is so much easier than it used to be."
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.040]   You need to regularly practice being disconnected, even outside of these sessions, so that you're
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.480]   more comfortable with it.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.160]   Do something every day without your phone.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.160]   Go have a meal.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.480]   Go drop off a book at the library.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:46.760]   It doesn't have to be long, like 10, 15 minutes, but just get used to this idea that sometimes
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:51.000]   you do things without highly salient, algorithmically curated distraction.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.200]   It just gets your brain used to the idea of like, "That's fine," and then you'll have
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.640]   more success with those study sessions.
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.920]   If you're really struggling in those study sessions, use timers.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:04.240]   I can do 50 minutes, and then I can go back to my dorm room and look at my computer or
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:06.560]   phone, and then I'll come back and set another timer.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:11.280]   When you're aiming towards a time-limited goal, like, "I just want to survive 50 minutes
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:15.440]   without looking at my phone," it's much easier to succeed than if you're just generally saying,
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:16.440]   "I'm going to study for hours.
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:17.440]   I don't want to look at my phone."
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.800]   Your mind will convince you, like, "Well, we have to look at it at some point.
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:20.800]   Why not now?
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:21.800]   Why not now?"
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:22.800]   Timing makes that much simpler.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.360]   Like, "I can last 50 minutes.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:25.360]   Come on.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.360]   It'd be embarrassing if I couldn't."
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:32.960]   All right, so outside of those two things—okay, I only had two—outside of those two things,
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.460]   the tech doesn't really matter.
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:40.000]   You practice studying and writing and doing schoolwork without connectivity, and you practice
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.520]   that in other parts of your life, and that's just how you do it.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.520]   Superpower.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:49.840]   I don't care if back in your room you have an iPhone 19 that's plugged into one of those
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:54.160]   like Apple Vision Pros, and you're wearing a Nintendo Power Glove.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:59.960]   Whatever you want to do with your technology outside of the studying, whatever, get used
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:03.280]   to that, and you're really, really going to do well.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.680]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.680]   We have our corner.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:16.440]   All right, let's hear some theme music.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.760]   So as regular listeners know, every week we like to have one question that deals with
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:25.720]   an issue from my latest book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:28.520]   If you have not read that book, you need to.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:32.640]   It is probably at the core of at least 50% of what we talk about on this show.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.040]   Go find that book, Slow Productivity, wherever books are sold.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:38.640]   All right, Jesse, what is our slow productivity corner question of the week?
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.680]   It's from Angel.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.320]   My workday consists of coding a new feature or fixing a bug.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:48.240]   Our company works on three-week sprints, and many of my coworkers crush it.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:52.080]   How can I work at a natural pace when it's out of my hands?
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:56.680]   I actually think sprints can be quite compatible with working at a natural pace.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.480]   Let's quickly define those two terms.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.720]   Sprint is an idea that comes out of agile software development methodologies, where
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:08.520]   you have a particular bug you're fixing or feature you're working on, and you just do
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.520]   that.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.520]   Right?
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.520]   So it's like just sprint working on this one thing until it's done, and then we'll change
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:18.560]   its status, and then we can figure out what you should work on next.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:23.360]   It's a methodology I really like because it recognizes the reality of instead trying to
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.480]   work on multiple things concurrently slows down the actual time per thing to get done.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.480]   Right?
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:34.480]   So if I work on three features concurrently, and then once I finish all three features,
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.520]   you know, divide that time by three, like what was the average time it took me to finish
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.200]   each of these three features?
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:44.720]   That average time tends to be much longer than if you did a sprint on the first feature,
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.680]   stopped, did a sprint on the second feature, stopped, did a sprint on the third feature,
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.680]   and stopped.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.240]   It's just because of the administrative overhead of working on something, and when you have
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.440]   to keep switching your context, it slows you down.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.840]   So sprints are a great idea.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.240]   I think they can be compatible with working at a natural pace.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:02.520]   Now that's the second principle from my book, Slow Productivity, which says humans are not
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.740]   meant to be working all out, all day, all week, all year.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.520]   We need variations in our intensity on multiple different time scales, otherwise it's really
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.280]   artificial and stressful.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.360]   Sprints can help you here in two ways.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:23.440]   One, at the macro scale, it gives you a natural down cycle period.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:29.680]   You finish a hard sprint, that sprint is over, you can now explicitly take a break until
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.680]   the next sprint begins.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.680]   Right?
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.280]   You have a natural place to down cycle.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.900]   Some software companies do this explicitly, Basecamp does this explicitly.
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:41.980]   You can read about down cycles in their employee handbook online, where after you finish a
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:46.300]   sprint on something big, they want you to take a sufficiently long down cycle where
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:49.020]   all you're doing is reflecting on what you just did, thinking about what you want to
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.740]   do next, and closing up loose ends.
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.140]   They say you can't skip this.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:57.140]   They said it might be natural, you feel more productive to jump into a next sprint right
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:01.700]   away, but don't, because if you don't restore overall, you're going to burn out and your
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.140]   effectiveness will go down.
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.700]   So consider adding a similar methodology like this.
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:07.700]   Just ask for it.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.060]   Just be like, yeah, this sprint was really hard.
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:14.420]   I want to take two days to just close up the loose ends and recharge, and then we'll start
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:16.220]   the next sprint.
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.900]   If you're doing good work, you know, it's fine.
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.900]   Like, whatever.
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:24.420]   Just, this sounds like a good idea, sounds like Cal Newport stuff, like go for it, right?
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:30.140]   Sprints can also be useful for varying up your intensity at the smaller scale as well.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:35.460]   Because you're just working on one thing, you have a lot more autonomy moment to moment.
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:39.100]   If the main thing I'm doing is working on this feature, I can, for example, do like
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:43.680]   a three hour, like really intense working on it, and then maybe like take two hours
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.940]   where I'm like going for a walk and just like recharging and thinking or like exercising
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.140]   or something like that.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:53.220]   You have more flexibility to do this because you just have one thing to work on.
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:58.380]   So there's not as much of a public trace of your efforts.
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:02.420]   Compare this to a typical pseudo productivity shop where you're just working on lots of
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:04.100]   stuff at the same time.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:08.180]   Now you have a lot more hard edges on which downcycling your intensity could hit.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.860]   You have a lot of meetings everywhere that like it's hard to get away from.
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:15.580]   You have all these emails going back and forth about 10 or 15 different things where it's
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:19.260]   notable if you don't answer an email for two hours, right?
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:25.580]   When you have a lot of things going on simultaneously, it's hard to downcycle for a few hours or
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.240]   take a day lighter than others.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.660]   When you're working on one thing you can, maybe like really get after it Monday and
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:36.340]   don't do much Tuesday, but then give it a big push on Wednesday, it all kind of adds
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.340]   up to the same.
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:41.100]   If you're working really hard when you work, we tend to do better with variations anyway,
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.740]   so it's not going to take you longer.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:47.620]   And because you're sprinting, I think you have a lot more flexibility, at least in shops
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:53.020]   that don't have this maddingly self-destructive habit of you should be slacking with people
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:55.740]   while you sprint, which makes no sense to me.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:01.880]   I think that's like owning an NBA team and making your players smoke a bunch of cigarettes.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.880]   It's counterproductive.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:07.680]   To make your programmers have to be on slack all day makes them significantly dumber in
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.680]   the moment.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.680]   You can't do that context shift.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.680]   You can't code that way.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:18.800]   So I think sprints can be on multiple scales compatible with working at a natural pace.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:22.960]   I guess you made it, when I was reading the question too, I was under the impression that
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:27.440]   the sprints were like right after the others, but you answered that by saying she should
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.440]   ask for it.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.440]   Just ask for it.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.440]   It's interesting.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.860]   When you're doing good work, and this is why the third principle of slow productivity is
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:36.840]   obsess over quality.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:41.480]   When you're doing good work, the biggest fear of your employer is losing you.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:45.880]   And it's a mindset shift you have to make as you get organized, using the type of stuff
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:49.960]   I talk about, and get good using the stuff I talk about.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:55.800]   You have to leave the mindset which fits earlier in your career, which is my employer is looking
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.580]   for reasons not to keep me on.
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:01.060]   My employer is looking for reasons to fire me.
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:02.780]   My employment here is contingent.
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:04.300]   They're not sure about me.
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:09.460]   At some point you change from that to we don't want to lose them.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.420]   And if you're doing great work, and they know you're super on the ball, and that you listen
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:17.020]   to my podcast, and that you're super organized, and you're really focused, and you say, here,
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:20.460]   I want to take these two-day down cycles, here's why.
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:21.860]   They don't want to lose you.
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:25.540]   I mean, worst thing, they might say no, but they're not going to get mad.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:29.940]   Speaking of basketball, I saw the other night Steph Curry playing the Wizards.
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:31.340]   Oh, you went to the game?
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:32.940]   Yeah, but he had a luxury box.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.940]   Nice.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:34.940]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:43.180]   He's a lawyer, so we just needed one of us to have a legitimate reason, connection to
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.900]   the law firm, or something like that.
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:45.900]   Right?
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.180]   It wasn't me.
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:50.740]   Look, I want to go out on a limb here with a hot take.
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:53.100]   Steph Curry's good at basketball.
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:54.100]   He's very good at basketball.
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.580]   He's been doing it for a long time, too.
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:57.580]   He has.
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.580]   But not that much taller than me.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.580]   He's really good at golf, too.
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.580]   I believe it.
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.580]   All right.
[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:02.580]   So that was our question.
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:06.580]   Let's get some theme music to end the corner.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:12.660]   All right, Jesse, we have a call this week.
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.660]   We do.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:14.660]   All right.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.660]   Let's hear it.
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:16.660]   Hi, Cal.
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:20.780]   My name is Amy, and I'm a PhD candidate in nursing living in Canada.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:27.140]   My question for you focuses on imperfectionism versus doing really good work that gets noticed
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:30.080]   or being so good they can't ignore you.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:33.420]   How do you know when your work is good enough to ship?
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:39.980]   Does it matter whether the work is like the type of work you're doing?
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:44.300]   And I'm just thinking about your recent conversation with Oliver Berkman on imperfectionism.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:47.300]   Thank you.
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:52.900]   You want tangible evidence about the value of your work, at least when it comes to your
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.740]   career and career shaping.
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:59.500]   You want to be working on things where the value is more unambiguous.
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:03.900]   This ship, this many units, this sold this many units, this got this much praise from
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:04.900]   the client.
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.700]   I brought in this much work.
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.040]   We have this much demand.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.100]   And why does this matter?
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:16.220]   Because it's the main trading chip you have for shaping your career.
[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:23.520]   Demonstration of unambiguously valuable capability or skills, that is your leverage for shaping
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.900]   the reality of your professional life.
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.860]   And if you can shape the reality of your professional life, you can shape it into really cool configurations
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.900]   that resonate with what's important to you.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.760]   This is my whole bit about lifestyle-centric planning.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.700]   You figure out your vision of the ideal lifestyle, and then you try to work backwards from that.
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.100]   Your profession is a big piece of that.
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:46.820]   Getting good at what you do in an unambiguous way is how you take control of your profession,
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:49.920]   and you're going to be much more likely to be able to shape your ideal lifestyle that
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.920]   way.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.260]   I mean, this is what Oliver did, right?
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:57.740]   He has his life right now as he's just like a full-time writer.
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.820]   He's not even a columnist anymore, he just writes books.
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:06.900]   And so what he talks about, this lifestyle of do deep work for like three hours a day,
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:11.900]   go write, do your best with the time that remains to kind of just have a to-do list
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:18.140]   and like do some useful stuff and then kind of be okay, and then go enjoy yourself and
[01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:19.940]   just be okay.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:25.400]   That is a particular vision, which resonates with me as well, by the way, a very particular
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:31.780]   vision of a lifestyle that Oliver was able to engineer in part because he was a successful
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:32.780]   writer.
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:37.140]   He became a journalist, his column was very successful, it gave him a name in this particular
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:38.580]   area.
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:39.580]   He began writing books.
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:43.620]   I think his first book didn't hit as big, but 4,000 Weeks really did.
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:47.020]   It was a culmination of this training and that really opened up this ability for him
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:52.180]   to then reduce the urgency and load of the things he has so that this particular lifestyle
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:56.420]   of write, do a little bit of admin, and then enjoy is possible.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:59.900]   So he's like a great example of lifestyle center career planning.
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:03.540]   So this is why, like in Slow Productivity, I say obsess over quality is this critical
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:06.820]   principle is because it enables everything else.
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:13.540]   But again, to get to the specifics of your question, don't shy away from unambiguous
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:16.020]   evaluation.
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:20.820]   That's where lifestyle-centric planning really can play.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:26.620]   It's scary because unambiguous evaluation can be unambiguous negative evaluation.
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:28.980]   I'm being attacked by a fly.
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:30.260]   I noticed that in here actually.
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:31.260]   I think I just grabbed it.
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:32.260]   Hold on.
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:33.260]   I did not.
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.260]   I did not.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.660]   I thought I was like Mr. Miyagi.
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:40.380]   I did not.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:46.700]   It's tempting to steer away from things that is going to be unambiguous about how valuable
[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:47.700]   it is.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.580]   Like this sold this many units.
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:52.380]   We will or will not give you the deal for this book.
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.860]   Like the clients bought this or not.
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.060]   Because it makes failure clear.
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:01.980]   But the flip side of things that have an unambiguous downside that you're afraid of is that the
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:05.200]   upside is going to be unambiguously useful.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.340]   And so that's the territory you swim towards.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:09.380]   Not everyone has to do this.
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:12.700]   Some people's vision of an ideal lifestyle doesn't require this.
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.780]   They're like, "Look, I have this particular job.
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.020]   It's not so hard to do it well.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:20.820]   It pays well as we live in the place I want to live.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.500]   I like the people that are there.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.820]   And building on top of this, I can make the rest of my life what I want it to be."
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:26.820]   That's fine.
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:29.980]   But if there's something more radical you want to do with your life, that's where you're
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:33.620]   going to have to do something where you have a big chance of notable failure.
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.220]   Because the flip side of that's what's going to give you the big leverage you need to make
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:37.220]   radical changes.
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:45.340]   So maybe that's the way I would put it is care about stuff that is too good to be ignored
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:51.500]   if you have visions in your lifestyle that are too desirable to be easily obtained.
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.900]   And that's a good way to think about it.
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:11:00.220]   All right, I think we have a case study here.
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:05.540]   So I like to do these now and again where we read tales that people talk about the specific
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:09.500]   ways in which they put the type of advice we talk about on the show, how they put into
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.820]   practice in their own life.
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:14.500]   So do we have a name?
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.500]   Susan.
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:21.460]   All right, Susan says, "I am a new manager with one direct report that is outsourced.
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:26.580]   I was very confused at first on what to include him in and when I should involve him in stuff.
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:31.000]   He's new to the business, so I just CC them on everything, inviting him to every meeting.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.780]   Maybe some of the emails would be educational, like my notes from various meetings or client
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:35.780]   responses.
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:38.020]   Maybe he would learn the business at the various meetings.
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:41.260]   We met once a week, but I was very unclear on what he was working on.
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:45.460]   I would send one-off tasks his way, but I was unclear if he had enough work to do or
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:46.460]   too much."
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:53.060]   Well, thanks to slow productivity, my clarity is drastically better.
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:58.260]   When I was whittling down the non-pseudo-productive work for him to do, I had to get very clear
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.140]   on what was important.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:03.580]   Now we meet more often for short updates, and he's got max three projects in a shared
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:04.580]   list.
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:08.340]   Since I know exactly what he is working on, I can stop spamming him with vaguely relevant
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:13.220]   emails and I can just update the list when I need the shared details or additional work
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:14.980]   or projects for him to do.
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:19.000]   Further, I started sharing my project list as well.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.740]   At first it was uncomfortable to have him see what I was working on.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:25.240]   I was holding myself accountable to his judgment.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.240]   What would he think?
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:29.980]   But having another human see what my projects are and having the frequent update meetings
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.780]   to show my incremental work has been rewarding.
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:37.000]   I look forward to one day having a larger team where we can all cross-collaborate in
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   this way.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.660]   All right, so Susan is demonstrating an important concept.
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:46.860]   This is from principle one of my book, Slow Productivity.
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:49.620]   Manage your workloads better.
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.180]   It's like the key thing.
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:56.940]   The key thing that we don't think about at all in knowledge work is workload management,
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.780]   and this is what causes so many problems.
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:00.300]   So what did Susan do?
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:03.320]   Following my advice, she said, "Let's be explicit.
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:06.140]   What are you working on and how many things should you work on?
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:09.820]   Oh, you probably shouldn't be working on more than three things at once, so let's be clear
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:10.820]   about what those are.
[01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.300]   We'll put them in a list.
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:16.180]   If other things come up, we could put them in a waiting queue right next to us.
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:19.820]   We won't forget about them, but I'm not going to ask you to work on them concurrently.
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:24.260]   When you finish one of these three, we can figure out together what's the right thing
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:27.340]   to put into your active list to replace it.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:32.100]   Two, you put in place a particular communication protocol for collaboration.
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:35.900]   Three-day-a-week meetings is great when you have a one-on-one like this because this means
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:39.000]   you don't have to send a one-off email.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.940]   You're never more than a day away from having a conversation.
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:47.460]   So now he can just keep track of, "Oh, what questions do I have?"
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:49.940]   When you next meet, you guys can efficiently go through them.
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:53.260]   You can keep track of questions you have and go through them.
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:58.220]   You know you're going to get an update on exactly where he is within a day.
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:03.620]   Thirty minutes, three days a week could take the place of thirty emails a day, five days
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:07.860]   a week, which is going to cause a constant state of having to go back and forth and check
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.180]   inboxes and stress.
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:13.660]   So Susan, I love the way that you made workload explicit, and by doing that, everyone got
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:15.800]   more effective.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.100]   You structure effort.
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.060]   Effort gets more sustainable.
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.060]   Effort gets easier.
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:24.980]   All right, so we got a final segment coming up where I promise I'm going to talk about
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:29.900]   Martha Stewart, but first, hear from a sponsor.
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:34.500]   Again, Jesse, as I drink from this big white mug, we need a sponsor.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:37.100]   Actually, it says MedStar Health on it.
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:41.820]   So in response to MedStar Health, I talked and gave a thing at a MedStar Health board
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:42.820]   meeting.
[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:43.820]   And they gave you a mug?
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:44.820]   They gave me a mug.
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:47.740]   And a free MRI?
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:48.740]   It was interesting.
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:51.740]   Yeah, they gave me an MRI for free.
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:54.540]   It was great.
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:58.980]   And a blood transfusion, which felt a little excessive, but they just wanted—it's what
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:14:59.980]   they had on hand.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:00.980]   What they had on hand.
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:07.420]   I want to talk today about a longtime sponsor of the show, MyBodyTutor.
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:10.340]   I've known Adam Gilbert, MyBodyTutor's founder, for many years.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:14.300]   He used to be the health advice columnist for my blog.
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:19.580]   His company, MyBodyTutor, is a 100% online coaching program that solves the biggest problem
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:24.060]   in health and fitness, which is the lack of consistency.
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:28.540]   They do this by simplifying the process and the practical sustainable behaviors, and then—and
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:32.500]   this is the magic to MyBodyTutor—they assign you to a coach.
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:39.580]   They assign you to a coach that you check in with daily, using their custom app, about
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:42.900]   how things went with your exercise behavior and nutrition behavior.
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:47.860]   This introduces accountability, and this is the thing that most fitness efforts lack.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:49.900]   It's not hard to figure out what you should be doing.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:52.380]   The hard part is to actually do it.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:58.300]   With a dedicated coach, you're much more likely to actually do it, and the dedicated coach
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:01.380]   can help you adapt to your specific situations.
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:02.880]   Thanksgiving's coming up.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.620]   How do I prepare myself for that?
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:08.500]   I'm traveling for a week for Christmas.
[01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.500]   What should I do?
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:13.600]   I won't have access to my gym, and I worry about overeating.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:19.460]   You can get custom strategies for specific things that are happening.
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:24.540]   MyBodyTutor has become very popular for the very simple reason that it works.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:29.860]   When you have a coach who is dedicated to working with you, you actually get results.
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:33.100]   Because the coaches are online, it's not nearly as expensive as actually having to have a
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:37.860]   nutritionist or a personal trainer come to your house or come to your kitchen.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:40.940]   It's a fantastic product.
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:44.220]   You can find out more at MyBodyTutor.com.
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:48.860]   If you mention deep questions when you sign up, Adam will give you $50 off your first
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:50.140]   month.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:55.540]   Go to MyBodyTutor.com and mention deep questions when you sign up to get $50 off your first
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.540]   month.
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:04.420]   I also want to talk about a clothing option that I have been a big fan of for a long time,
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:07.220]   and that is the commuter collection from Roan.
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:10.220]   Look, we're in fall.
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:14.860]   Fall needs its own wardrobe full of comfortable and coordinated pieces for a layered look
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:15.860]   with perspective.
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:23.620]   And you need that warmth while maintaining, I'm a big believer in this, breathability.
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:26.880]   This is where the Roan's commuter collection comes in.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:31.400]   Your clothing will look professional, it'll perform like activewear, and it will feel
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.400]   totally comfortable.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.660]   Alright, Roan's commuter collection is the most comfortable, breathable, and versatile
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:39.000]   set of products known to man.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.360]   Its premium pieces elevate every occasion.
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:49.120]   We're talking about pants, dress shirts, quarter zips, polos, blazers, all boosted to be more
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.400]   functional.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.400]   How do they do that?
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:57.240]   Well, they have the Roan's signature technical fabrics that stretch in every direction, breathe,
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:02.000]   fight odor, and effortlessly work everywhere.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.360]   I love the breathability of the Roan commuter collection because I'm often active.
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:13.560]   I'm giving speeches, I'm teaching classes, I'm running around from one place to the other
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:16.080]   on a campus, and I want something that looks good, that's lightweight and breathes.
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:19.080]   I don't want to feel hot in a starched shirt.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:23.240]   And if you're traveling, the Roan commuter collection also has wrinkle release technology.
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:26.360]   The wrinkles leave as you go through the day, you don't have to worry about packing the
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.520]   things and them being wrinkled.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:32.240]   And at home, they're machine washable, no dry cleaning needed.
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.840]   You got that gold fusion anti-odor, if you have a big, long day, you're going to stay
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.840]   fresh.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:41.960]   So anyways, the commuter collection can get you through any workday and straight into
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.800]   whatever comes next.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:49.320]   Head to Roan.com/Cal and use promo code Cal to save 20% off your entire order.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:57.020]   That's 20% off your entire order when you head to R-H-O-N-E.com/Cal and use code Cal.
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:00.160]   It's time to embody your most confident self.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:06.880]   All right, Jesse, let's get to our final segment.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.880]   All right.
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:15.640]   So we load on the screen here for people who are watching instead of just listening.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:23.160]   This is the trailer for the new Netflix documentary Martha about Martha Stewart.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.160]   Good documentary.
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.160]   Have you seen it yet, Jesse?
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.160]   I have.
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.160]   It was good, right?
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:31.920]   Let me tell you what caught my attention.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:39.880]   Early on, especially when her career was taking off, I was remarking, she must be incredibly
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:46.240]   busy because she had this property, the Turkey Hill Farm, that she was sort of custom renovating
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.920]   as acres and acres of property into like all these like custom gardens.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:55.200]   She had this catering company, this like really famous catering company would do these major
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.920]   catering jobs that were like very famous.
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:04.840]   It's just a complicated logistical battle with your clients, but also with the people
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:09.200]   who are working with you and the chefs and the servers.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.200]   And she was writing.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.120]   She was writing these books, which are on the screen right now, and she's writing these
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.120]   books like once a year.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:17.320]   I mean, of course, as her empire grew into a big media publicly traded company, she was
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:18.320]   super busy.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:22.160]   But we're kind of used to the idea of like CEOs of big companies being really busy and
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.160]   having big staffs.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:27.160]   I was interested in this like earlier part of her life where she had so much different
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.160]   things going on.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.560]   I mean, I still have skeletons in my yard, Jesse.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:36.360]   And I'm not working on nearly as many stuff as she was.
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:41.560]   And she was landscaping by hand like 50 acres of a farm.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.560]   So I started thinking.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:46.600]   I was like, you know, the time management book I would be curious in is one written
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.640]   by Martha Stewart.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:49.960]   Like how does she manage her time?
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.100]   Like how did that work?
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:54.500]   And it turns out she did.
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.360]   She did write a book.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.360]   I didn't know this.
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:00.360]   And it was called like Martha Stewart's Organizing.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:04.440]   I have a picture of it here on the screen.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.440]   She did write a book about time management.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.720]   So I was like, oh, I'm just fascinated.
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:07.720]   Like how does she do all this?
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:13.040]   And then I look at this book and I look at the tips in it and I said, this has nothing
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.700]   to do with how someone like Martha Stewart organizes her life.
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:18.120]   So here's the book.
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:24.140]   You can already see by the cover with like paper clips in a neat box and a well wrapped
[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:29.200]   up USB cable that this is not about how Martha Stewart built her empire while writing books
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.600]   while also renovating all this land.
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:34.200]   Look at some of the tips that she highlighted from this book.
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:37.160]   Keep your kitchen drawers well organized.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.920]   Maybe using her expandable in-drawer utensil tray.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:47.640]   Have a ceramic tool crock on your kitchen countertop to keep those kitchen utensils
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.060]   neatly put away.
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:56.760]   Make sure in your home office that you have file folders with vine decals on them so that
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.580]   they're aesthetically pleasing.
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:02.340]   She has a planner.
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:05.760]   The Martha Stewart Spiral updated weekly calendar.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.420]   It's very pretty.
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:13.060]   It has like roughly enough space on it for like seven things to write down.
[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:15.500]   And that's all the advice she gives.
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:19.460]   I bring this up because it points to an important divide when we talk about time management
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:23.700]   productivity that we don't always elucidate.
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:30.180]   And that's the difference between aesthetic productivity and real productivity.
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:33.980]   So these products and what Martha Stewart has talked about in that book is what I call
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:36.180]   aesthetic productivity.
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:41.340]   It's typically based on organizing physical things in a pretty way and it uses that metaphor
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:42.500]   for organizing your life.
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:46.060]   You should have like a beautiful little notebook and draw these pictures in it and have stickers
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:47.900]   you put on it.
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:53.020]   And then there's real productivity, which is I have a huge amount of stuff in my life.
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:55.100]   My schedule is very crowded.
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:58.380]   My attention is being pulled in all sorts of directions.
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:03.460]   I need to take control of this shit, like what Martha Stewart did at the height of her
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:08.260]   early busyness to try to build this empire that she did.
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:12.780]   And none of that has to do with drawer organizers or pretty planners that have pictures of flowers
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.580]   on the cover.
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:19.940]   It's complicated, hard, super focused work.
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:23.860]   It is the equivalent to athletes for all the training they do in the gym.
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:28.300]   And like when it comes to athletes who are good at what they do, we don't downplay how
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:30.620]   hard that is and how important the training is.
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:38.260]   Well, I think for any sort of knowledge work, it is the continually adjusted fight to keep
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:42.980]   control of the chaos is this like very difficult thing we have to do to be able to succeed
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:49.100]   with our jobs and aesthetic productivity, I think downplays it, makes it seem more minor,
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:55.580]   makes it seem like, you know, it's a matter of taste or sort of owning the right tools.
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:24:00.200]   So I would be really interested in like an actual, an actual productivity book from Martha
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.380]   Stewart.
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:03.740]   I could tell you, I don't know what you think, Jesse, from that documentary would be pretty
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:04.740]   brutal.
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:05.740]   I would assume.
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:10.740]   It would say like only sleep four hours a night, which she did.
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:11.740]   Fire fools.
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:14.500]   She was firing people left and right.
[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:18.980]   If you need something done, yell, not the nicest, not the nicest person.
[01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:23.260]   I bet she was super time blocked if I had to guess.
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:26.860]   Super time blocked, like exactly when I'm going to fit in these things to make it all
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:27.860]   work.
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:32.060]   I bet her information systems were locked in tight, like every order of food and who
[01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:33.740]   were hiring and where's the staff.
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.140]   I think she hired good people and fired anyone who wasn't great.
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:43.380]   Like I mean, I think, man, that, that the real Martha Stewart time management book would
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:46.580]   probably be like Sun Tzu's Art of War.
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:49.580]   It'd be a pretty brutal book if I had to guess.
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:53.940]   They don't, you know, I'm not suggesting most people need to do that level of extreme organization
[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:55.660]   because she's way too stressed.
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:57.220]   What she does is way too stressful.
[01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:01.840]   But it is interesting that we don't, as like another aside, we don't often see a lot of
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.620]   windows into how like the, like the hyper busy organize themselves.
[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:06.620]   I'm very curious about it.
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:07.620]   It's like a curiosity.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:12.860]   I only know of one such book, which I think is actually called Hyper Productivity, and
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:16.060]   it literally was just like a very busy executive who sat on a lot of boards and said, here's
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:17.060]   how I organize my stuff.
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:19.100]   And yeah, it's hard and a lot of systems.
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:21.060]   I'm really fascinated by that type of stuff.
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:25.260]   Again, not that people need to do that because most people's ideal lifestyle does not involve
[01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:27.620]   like what Martha Stewart's ideal lifestyle involved.
[01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:32.460]   It doesn't involve juggling five boards and like two public companies or whatever.
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:35.060]   But it's a curiosity to me how they do it.
[01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:40.140]   But the one thing I know about how they do it, it's not to draw organizers or file folders
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:42.100]   with vines on them.
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:46.340]   The one thing that I looked at a lot in the documentary was just, you know, the stock
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:50.660]   price obviously went down a lot when she was in, had her legal troubles and stuff.
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:51.660]   So I just checked it.
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:54.060]   It's at 6.4 now.
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:55.820]   So she's probably still a billionaire, right?
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.180]   I don't know.
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:02.940]   That's a good question because when she was a billionaire, it was in the 20s, wasn't it?
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:07.720]   It was, the initial offering was at 18, which I guess in today's dollars is like 33.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:10.220]   So not optimal.
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:13.420]   She sold it to like a brand management company or something.
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:14.420]   Oh, she did?
[01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:15.420]   Yeah.
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:16.420]   A licensing company.
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:20.300]   Like how long ago?
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:21.940]   After jail.
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:23.580]   Okay.
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:25.700]   Probably early 2010s.
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:30.420]   So they just licensed the brand name.
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:31.420]   The thing that, okay.
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:32.420]   So here's, if we're going to talk about Martha.
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:37.020]   The other thing that caught my attention is the scoreboard aspect.
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:43.220]   Like the fact that she's like, I want to make, I want this to be a company that goes public.
[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:48.140]   And I want to be like the richest self-made woman in the world at the time.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.300]   There's no functional reason to do that, right?
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:53.560]   Because this is a, when you have a brand built around a person, like what we've learned in
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:59.380]   like today's economy is you can make a killing when it's built around you and you just have
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:00.380]   a real talent for it.
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:03.340]   You can make a killing and have all sorts of autonomy and flexibility.
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:07.160]   There's no reason to like build an omnimedia company that has like all these employees
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.160]   or this or that, right?
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.980]   There's no reason she could have been making a killing with like books and could have her
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:14.780]   magazine and a TV show and just be like, I'm really well known.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:15.780]   I'm really good at this.
[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:17.980]   And I get paid a lot of money to do this.
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:20.660]   There's no reason to have to start a major company.
[01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:24.180]   And then once you have that major company, they had to have like a 50 different magazines
[01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:28.420]   and like 20 different shows just to try to like justify whatever.
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:29.420]   So it's interesting.
[01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:33.180]   There's a scale to that where today is like the podcast economy.
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:36.200]   If you have that level of talent, so like she was exceptional enough that you could
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.100]   build this whole company around her.
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:41.500]   You can get $150 million podcast deal.
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.300]   Except for now, what are you doing for that $150 million?
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:47.520]   You're podcasting once a week or whatever, which is so much different than being the
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.660]   CEO of a public company.
[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:53.860]   So it really caught my attention that she wanted to start a big company.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:55.380]   I think she likes the limelight too.
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:57.580]   Obviously, I mean, she wanted to do the documentary.
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:58.580]   How old is she?
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:27:59.580]   We looked it up.
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:00.580]   80.
[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:01.580]   She's 80.
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:02.580]   81 or 82.
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:03.580]   Good.
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:04.580]   Yeah.
[01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:05.580]   Yeah.
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:06.580]   Because she was 63 when she went to jail.
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:07.580]   Yeah.
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:08.580]   Yeah.
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:09.580]   She's older than you think.
[01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:10.580]   Yeah.
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:11.580]   She looks great.
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:12.580]   Yeah.
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:13.580]   I guess that's just me.
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.580]   It's lifestyle centric planning.
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:17.860]   I'm like, oh, if I had this big brand that could be built, and I kind of have a reasonable
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:19.540]   brand built around me.
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:22.680]   All of my instincts is not how do we build a huge media company?
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:31.760]   It's like, how do we build a very autonomous, flexible business off of that that doesn't
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:32.760]   require board meetings?
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:33.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:34.760]   Interesting topic.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:35.760]   All right.
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:36.760]   Anyway, that's all the time we have this week.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:37.760]   We'll be back next week with another episode.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:38.760]   If you listen to my advice from the beginning, maybe it'll be one of the few podcasts you'll
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:39.760]   be listening to next week.
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:40.760]   Until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:41.760]   If you enjoyed today's discussion about unplugging after the election and you want some more
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:58.740]   advice about doing these types of digital declutters, check out Episode 318, which is
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:00.480]   called Take a Break.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:03.160]   It also has a lot of good advice along these lines.
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:05.080]   Check it out.
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.380]   Want to boost your productivity?
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:11.320]   Hit the movies during work, expert says.
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.920]   A spoiler alert, that expert is me.
