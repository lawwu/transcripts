[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.640]   - Well, thank you very much for having me.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.780]   - We are here in San Jose, Costa Rica,
[00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.780]   and the reason I point out where we are
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.580]   is because I'm very excited to bring your story

[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.340]   Thank you for being here.
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.420]   - Well, thanks for the introduction.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.540]   - So I would like to go back a good number of decades.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.140]   You, as I understand it, are not originally from Costa Rica.
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.980]   You weren't born and raised here, is that right?
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.820]   - Nope.
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.340]   - Where did you grow up?
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.140]   - I grew up in New York City in the Bronx,
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.460]   and then a little bit later, high school,
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.580]   I lived in Connecticut.
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.580]   As most people sort of, when parents make some money,
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.860]   they want to go to the suburbs.
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.820]   - Right.
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.140]   - And then I wanted to get out of the East Coast,
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.420]   so I went to school in the University of Michigan.
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.260]   - Okay.
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.540]   - And became an economist
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.420]   and always dreamed of traveling.
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.460]   So I figured that I better learn something
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.700]   that would allow me to travel to warm countries.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.620]   And so I did an apprenticeship
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.340]   as a coffee taster in New York City.
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.780]   And that's sort of how I ended up.
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.380]   To make a long story short,
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.260]   that's how I ended up in Costa Rica,
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.180]   because at that time, Costa Rica was sort of considered
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.420]   to be, and I guess it still is considered to some extent
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.500]   to be the Bordeaux of coffee-growing countries.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:01.020]   At that time in my travels,
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.300]   what I became was sort of a quality controller
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.260]   of coffee exports, and then ultimately a buyer
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.900]   for a big trading company.
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.220]   But at that time, and I'm talking about the '70s,
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.940]   what we really did was what we were buying
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.500]   were ingredients,
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.500]   because you have to sort of put yourself back
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.660]   past and before the era of Starbucks and coffee shops
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.820]   and all that sort of stuff,
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.540]   and think that at that time what people thought
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.860]   of as coffee were cans.
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.820]   Cans that were, cans were maybe instant coffee jars,
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.940]   but they were cans that had a brand,
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.200]   and that's what you knew.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.900]   You didn't know that coffee came
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.700]   from any particular country or anything.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.300]   You just thought of it as being something
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.620]   that you put milk and sugar in and you...
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.860]   And also the other interesting part about it then
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.860]   was that marketing for coffee
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.000]   at that time was basically being a loss leader.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.340]   So what that meant is that you knew that the housewife,
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.740]   who was the only person who went to the supermarket,
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.460]   would have to buy coffee.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.460]   So coffee companies compete by having a lower price
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.700]   so that they would go to that supermarket
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.220]   to buy everything else,
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.300]   because they bought, because the coffee was cheaper,
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.300]   because that's something that was like the staple
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.500]   that they had to buy.
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   So our job as coffee traders and suppliers of ingredients
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:02.180]   were, and as a coffee trader is also like a,
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.060]   as a taster, but also a blender,
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.060]   our job was to figure out how to allow
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.060]   the brand to have the taste that people wanted
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.300]   in the cheapest possible way.
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.540]   And what that means really is understanding
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.260]   the crop cycles of different countries.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.380]   And, you know, coffee is a one-year crop,
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.900]   but it's harvested at different times in different places.
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.620]   And also you wanted to know about
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.580]   sort of relative pricing of places.
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.300]   So that was sort of the skill that I acquired.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.980]   And Costa Rica was a really great place for that because,
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.220]   and that's why I say it was considered to be the Bordeaux,
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.220]   is Costa Rica was the place which had,
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.020]   for some reason, had the characteristic
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.020]   of producing a coffee that smelled as good as it tasted,
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.320]   or tasted as good as it smelled,
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.300]   which if you stop and think about it
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.300]   is actually pretty rare.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.780]   You actually think that, "Oh, it really smells good."
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.700]   And you taste the coffee, say,
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.620]   "Hey, I better put some milk and sugar in it, right?"
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.540]   - Cover it up.
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.340]   - Yeah, so Costa Rica was a pretty cool place like that.
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:31.020]   And so people would, you know, coffee roasters
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.580]   would buy Costa Rican coffee in order to sort of
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.380]   upgrade their blends or to get that smell.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.300]   We always thought one of the funnier ones was the whoosh.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.220]   You know the whoosh when you open up the coffee can?
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.060]   - Yeah, it would pop out.
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.020]   - That smells Costa Rica, you see?
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.860]   - Right.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.020]   - You know, who cares what else you put?
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.260]   Ah, wow, that really smells good.
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.260]   So that's sort of what brought me here and what got me,
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.660]   and I became a coffee exporter and a miller
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.580]   and doing things that,
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.860]   and ended up supplying coffee to people,
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.460]   green coffee to people all over the world.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.620]   - But a question.
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.380]   So you were in your early 20s, it sounds like.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.360]   You had gone to college, studied economics,
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.060]   and then you'd gotten a job working as a taster
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.680]   for a coffee company.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.060]   So were they sending you to Costa Rica to be a buyer?
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.060]   - No, I sent myself.
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.420]   - Okay, so there was an entrepreneurial aspect
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.260]   to the kind of--
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.020]   - Oh yeah, no, I just went, I printed a business card.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.820]   - You printed a business card, you got on an airplane,
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.780]   flew from New York to San Jose.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.060]   - Actually, I flew from New York to Mexico and met my wife,
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.580]   met a lady who became my wife,
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.700]   and we just started to travel together.
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.980]   And we ended up saying, "Here, this is where we wanna be."
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.140]   - How did you meet her?
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.920]   - She was sitting on the grass in Mexico
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.420]   talking to a nice-looking lady,
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.860]   and I actually wanted to talk to that lady.
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.260]   And she sort of bawled me out,
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.720]   and I was sort of attracted to that, to her personality.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.200]   (laughing)
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.080]   And yeah, it was pretty, it was random.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.880]   - Okay. - It was random, I mean.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.920]   - So did you have savings?
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.840]   Were you a penniless hitchhiker,
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.000]   or did you have some savings from your jobs?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.920]   - No, no, I was pretty, I had about $1,000.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.120]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.120]   - Okay, so this is the 1970s.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.760]   You had $1,000 or so saved. - 1973, exactly, yeah.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.960]   - And you go to Costa Rica, you print up some--
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.800]   - Well, I go to Mexico. - To Mexico,
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.520]   and then you meet your wife,
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.120]   and you-- - And I had a business card,
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.600]   and so the first job I got was as a consultant
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.160]   to the Mexican Coffee Institute.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.000]   - Okay. - You know,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.080]   'cause I had a business card from New York, right?
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.000]   So that was-- - Right.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.560]   - Coffee taster. - Big shot, right?
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.080]   - Yeah, and I had a New York address,
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.200]   so they thought that was cool.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.400]   And yeah, so I worked for the Mexican Coffee Institute
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.400]   for a while, and then since I had already been an apprentice,
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.160]   you know, I mean, I had already worked in New York
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.720]   as a coffee taster, and I'd worked on the exchange,
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.320]   but as an apprentice, I mean, I was working,
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.200]   I was making $800 a month or something.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.620]   I think the highest salary I had was $1,000 a month.
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.280]   And it was, you know, because I was like the low man
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.560]   on the totem pole, I was a young guy, you know,
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.480]   I'd take samples to different coffee trading companies.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.880]   At that time, the center of the coffee trade
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.880]   was in lower Manhattan, where the South Seaport is,
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.760]   Seaport Mall is right now, that was sort of the center
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.160]   of the coffee trading world, actually.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.160]   So yeah, when I, so after, since I knew companies
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.440]   and they knew, you know, they knew that I was a cheap guy,
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.600]   a cheap guy that nobody was doing, I ended up getting hired
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:05.720]   by one of them to be their sort of outside man
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.200]   to check on shipments and ultimately become a buyer.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.320]   And I did that, and I sort of moved up the totem pole
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.760]   in the company until they wanted to give me
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.760]   a real serious promotion and let me go and live in New York
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.520]   and work on the 25th floor of a building
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.520]   and take the subway and live like a normal person.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.080]   And I said, "Nah, I think I'll stay here,"
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.000]   which is where you are right now.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.840]   - Right.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.400]   - And I told the fellow who offered me the job,
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.280]   I said, "Well, you know, can you give me this lifestyle?"
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.920]   And he said, "No, but you'll live like I do, you know,
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.640]   "you have two vacations," and all sorts
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.720]   of cool stuff like that.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.200]   So, and make a lot of money.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.040]   - Right.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.680]   - So, yeah, so then I started my own business
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.160]   with two other partners, and it was,
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.160]   and the business at that time, because of the situation,
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.580]   the way the industry worked at that time,
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.800]   the way for somebody who's starting a business
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.000]   was to do something different.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And there were a lot of people doing things different then,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.160]   when there were guys that started,
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.760]   the guy who started Pete's in Berkeley,
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.680]   or actually in Emeryville, but it was one store
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.520]   and a couple of hippies from, who worked for him,
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.520]   went to Seattle and started a coffee shop there,
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.400]   these guys who started a place called Starbucks.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.000]   And then there was another fella that worked for,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.480]   in a coffee shop in Los Angeles,
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.920]   who started something called Seattle's Best Coffee,
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.040]   and they were all like that.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.240]   They were all young guys that were doing something else,
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.160]   that were selling coffee for what it tasted like,
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.960]   and where it came from, and things like that.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.960]   But they didn't, you know, they didn't have the training,
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.680]   the industry training that I did.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.800]   So I became a supplier to a lot of those guys.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.640]   So that was our business.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.200]   - So when you say supplier,
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.640]   you're physically here in Latin America.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.880]   Are you going out to the plantations, the farmers,
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.400]   and sorting through the green beans and saying,
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.760]   "Okay, we're gonna send these beans to this guy up there."
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.200]   - Yeah, yeah, I used to have, I had a motorcycle.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.120]   I'd go visit people all over the place, yeah.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.200]   I mean, I visited every quarter of this country, sure.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.000]   That's what, I mean, you didn't only sort the green beans.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.640]   We would actually buy the cherry.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.480]   - Okay.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.560]   - Which, coffee's the product of a cherry, right?
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.320]   So we'd buy the cherry, and then either,
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.200]   I mean, ultimately I became partners in mills,
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.560]   in a couple of mills, but--
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.760]   - So you developed your own sources of collecting,
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.760]   'cause the way, my understanding
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.280]   of the way the coffee business works,
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.120]   I've spent a total of one day harvesting coffee.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.400]   It was one of the hardest days of work of my life.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.160]   Those guys are amazing, the harvesters.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.680]   But my understanding is, it seems to me,
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.040]   like most of the coffee growers,
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.880]   and maybe it's different today versus how it was,
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.280]   most of the coffee farms are independent.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.760]   Guy has his own crop.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.820]   Then a team of pickers will come through,
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.560]   usually migrant laborers.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.320]   They'll pick, and then there seem to be now
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.580]   a good number of co-ops that will bring the beans together.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.240]   Was it that way back then as well?
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.080]   - Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.960]   - Okay, so then you would set up the relationship
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.600]   with the co-op, and come and buy the co-op's beans.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.600]   - Yeah, or I would have a relationship with a grower,
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.280]   and tell him what co-op to go to.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.120]   - Got it.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.540]   - Because it's sort of, we have this little saying,
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.260]   is that what you do in the coffee mill,
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.340]   or in the, what's called the beneficio,
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.020]   can add or subtract 200 meters from the coffee.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:09.280]   'Cause one of the characteristics that you look for
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.260]   in coffee is the height at which it was grown.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.480]   And you can add or subtract height
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.400]   by the way you treat it after harvest.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.240]   - Got it.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.720]   - So a lot of what we were doing,
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.280]   a lot of what, especially since I was supplying
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.280]   or buying coffee for people who really cared about it,
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.360]   who were selling coffee for two, $3 a cup,
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.600]   or $8 a pound rather than $1.99 on sale
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:43.600]   in a supermarket, they really knew their stuff.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.520]   And they wanted to, they really knew
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.760]   what they wanted to buy.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.920]   And so I had to give them the stuff
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.160]   that they wanted to buy.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.000]   - Right.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.520]   - And so yeah, so that was sort of the expertise
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.520]   that we, that me and my partners developed at that time.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.360]   So what we did is really translated the expertise
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:14.360]   of commodity suppliers to the expertise
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.440]   of finding the finest coffees.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.440]   And so these oddball guys that were very, very marginal.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.680]   I mean, these were very small companies
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   and sort of oddballs outside of the coffee business, right?
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.240]   Until they became the coffee business.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.240]   - Yeah. - Whereas now,
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.640]   most of people I know, I'm the weirdo
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.520]   who I will still, I can still drink a cup
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.400]   of Maxwell House or Folgers coffee and enjoy it.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.360]   But I know almost no one who does that,
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.320]   at least in my social circles.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.000]   - Yeah, it's a very interesting sort of business story
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   because the sort of the specialty coffee industry
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.320]   by sort of mid '90s represented about 50%
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.240]   of the dollar volume of the coffee world.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.960]   And in the '80s, it represented like 1%, right?
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.840]   So and the 50% that they took,
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.720]   they took it from companies like General Foods
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.560]   and Nestle and Procter & Gamble.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.280]   I mean, so here are these gigantic companies
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.840]   who weren't looking out the window, right?
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.240]   Who weren't looking in the rear view mirror of their car
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.000]   because it was just coming right at 'em.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.840]   - Right.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.840]   - Because it's sort of the beginning of disruption, right?
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.280]   Of the small company with the guy in the,
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.200]   or the apples of the, it was sort of the apples
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.240]   of the coffee industry in a certain way.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:52.080]   So that's, so then it sort of occurred to me
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   that it was probably a good idea to start to do that here.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:02.800]   And well, I'll just tell you a little.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.200]   An anecdote which I always think is sort of cool
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   is when I was 40, I went back to college
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.600]   and took my whole family to California,
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.960]   went to Stanford for a year.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:22.280]   And was, and the goal was to get a master's
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.320]   in agricultural economics 'cause I thought,
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.600]   well, I should really understand a bit more
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.560]   about what I was doing.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.560]   And so we bought a house in Palo Alto.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:42.600]   And then we decided to remodel the kitchen.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.720]   And as we were, guy who came to remodel it,
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.440]   to do the work, the guy, the plumber actually,
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:53.320]   who put in the sink, asked me, "Well, what do I do?"
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.800]   And I said, "Oh yeah, I'm in the coffee business."
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.920]   He said, "Well, you know, I really like Ethiopian Yirgacheffe
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.160]   but sometimes I blend it with Kenya."
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.920]   And I said, "Whoa, this guy's a plumber."
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.840]   (both laughing)
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.200]   I said, "There's something going on here.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.040]   There's another conception of what coffee is."
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.840]   And so that was, so when I came back,
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.600]   I said, "Well, I think I should start to do that.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.400]   I think you should start to think about
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.400]   what my customers are doing."
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.280]   And at that time also Costa Rica was getting on the map
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.240]   because Oscar Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.040]   And there was peace in Central America
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.960]   and people wanted to go to a place that was peaceful.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.120]   And people were starting to become conscious
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.360]   that coffee's some sort of a cool thing.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.920]   And so here's a place that's peaceful,
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.600]   has nice weather and coffee grows here.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.640]   Well, maybe we should start to give them
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.720]   the type of coffee that they think is really good
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.440]   and they're buying in the States.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.240]   And that's sort of how Cafe Brit started.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.240]   So it really started as a small subsidiary
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.800]   of a coffee trading company that was supplying green
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.320]   or that is unroasted coffee to coffee roasters,
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.680]   sort of specially coffee roasters around the world.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.400]   So it was like a little tiny,
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.600]   you know, we had a little tiny roaster and we did that.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.600]   We roasted coffee for hotels and places where tourists went.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.800]   And then it just started to grow
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.960]   because really our customer base started to grow.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.120]   And really, I guess what really gave it its first big push
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.880]   was what I was telling you earlier was mail order.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:02.240]   Which was at that time was mail order.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.200]   You actually sent stuff by mail and people sent you a fax
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.200]   or sent you a letter in what's called snail mail now
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.280]   with a check in it.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.240]   And then you'd put coffee in an envelope or in a box
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.080]   and take it to the mail, take it to the post office
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.200]   and send it to them.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.200]   That was mail order.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.440]   And then we realized that in Costa Rica,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.680]   if we took the coffee to the post office,
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.920]   the post office would try to figure out
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.760]   how to send it to the United States.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.520]   And this is a Latin American country.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.320]   So it took them a couple of weeks to figure that out.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.640]   And so we figured out is that once they figured out that,
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.320]   they would take it to the airport
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.920]   and send it as a package.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.360]   And so then we went to the post office and said,
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.880]   well, what if we become like a subsidiary of the post office
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.800]   and you can give us a stamp machine
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.440]   and we'll take it to the airport ourselves.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.800]   And the post office said,
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.760]   nobody's ever told us that before.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.520]   And then they said, yes.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.400]   So all of a sudden we cut two weeks out of the trip
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.760]   because somebody said, we want coffee.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.800]   We just took to the airport and sent it to them.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.960]   And then the internet came and then mail order
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.520]   became online ordering and e-commerce.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.120]   And we ended up with a warehouse in Miami
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.000]   so that then people really could get their coffee
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.080]   within a day when they ordered it.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:50.720]   And that was sort of the beginning of...
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.720]   So little by little,
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.760]   I got out of the green coffee supplying business
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.560]   and started the coffee roaster.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:04.000]   And that coffee roasting company
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.680]   also became sort of a traditional,
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.320]   specially coffee roaster,
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.080]   which meant that we got the representation
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.160]   of espresso machine companies
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.160]   and commercial grinder and brewery company.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.600]   So we would go to hotels and say, here you go.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.120]   You got your coffee, you have your machines.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.880]   We'll put the little coffee maker in the rooms
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.600]   and all those things that didn't exist
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.240]   because this was a country
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.640]   in which the tourism industry was just starting.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.800]   And so we were at the ground floor of that.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.640]   And the end of it is a story
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.720]   that you started this whole thing about
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   is that they first started to privatize the airport here
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.720]   and that happened in all sorts of other countries
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.000]   in Latin America.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.720]   And we set up stores in the airports,
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.080]   in the airport here,
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.200]   and became part of that industry
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.640]   of what's called travel retail.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.600]   Which in effect, again,
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.080]   it's sort of a luck thing
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.920]   because as in the specially coffee industry,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.000]   we happen to be around at the ground floor, right?
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   And the same thing happened with travel retail.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.400]   That is that travel retail really started
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.320]   to develop seriously as the airport business
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.040]   became a lot more than just planes flying in.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.000]   It became sort of malls.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.800]   And when the sort of the ground services
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.920]   became more and more important,
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:09.400]   now you have lounges and you have all sorts of things.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.560]   You have spas and churches
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.360]   and all sorts of things at airports.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.040]   We think of this as being the normal thing,
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   but that was very new.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.960]   I mean, the first place that did that was Dubai
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.400]   and everybody, and people would go to Dubai to watch it,
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.360]   to look at it, say, wow.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.440]   There's all these things you can do in the airport.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.600]   But it really became important
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:39.040]   as international tourism grew
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.640]   and as countries began to realize
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.680]   that they really couldn't run airports
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.240]   as well as airport operators could.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.040]   And they found out that when they gave the airport,
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.720]   when the contract to the airport operator,
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.840]   the government actually made more money.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.720]   And the airport operators realized
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.960]   that they have real estate that they can use
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.680]   and they have a captive audience, the real estate.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.240]   So they had the best mall in the world
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.360]   because people didn't have to go,
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.680]   you didn't have to ask them to come.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.640]   They were there anyway.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.320]   - Right, and they were there with an hour on their hands
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   and they're probably affluent buyers who are traveling.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.760]   Most people who travel are probably more affluent
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.000]   than many non-travelers.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.080]   And Brit has become a powerhouse of a brand.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.060]   I mean, it began in Costa Rica,
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.800]   but even in the airports, I think,
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.760]   I've seen it in Colombia.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.200]   I've seen it in Mexico.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.040]   Where else have I, I mean--
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.240]   - Peru, Chile.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.360]   - Peru, yep, yep, I saw it in Peru.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.120]   Yeah, and so--
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.960]   - Curaçao.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.840]   - All over the place.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.520]   And so it's just become an amazing brand.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.680]   Now I wanna go back for a second
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.560]   'cause at this point,
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.920]   your children are involved in the business.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.080]   - Yeah, most of them.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.120]   - And so I wanna go back.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.400]   So your wife was originally from Europe, right?
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.240]   - From France, yeah.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.080]   - From France.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.480]   And you met in Mexico and she said,
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.360]   "Hey, I'll come along on this adventure together with you."
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.320]   And you've built this together and you have five children.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.800]   Now, one of the things that I think is so fascinating
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.640]   is being here in Costa Rica,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.280]   your wife saw the need for your children
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.920]   to have a high-quality education,
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.520]   but she, as I understand it, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.360]   she was a little frustrated
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.840]   with some of the options available.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.320]   So she began the European school here in Costa Rica.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.240]   Tell me more about that.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.440]   - She was already an educator.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.440]   I mean, she'd already,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.080]   she came from a family of educators.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:39.320]   Her parents had a school and she grew up in--
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.320]   - So she grew up in her parents' school?
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.240]   - And so the idea of starting a school
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.120]   was not a scary thing for her, was it?
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.800]   - No, no, and I met her in Mexico.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.480]   She was actually in sort of a seminar.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.680]   She was in a one-year seminar about education.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.880]   So yeah, so she'd been,
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.440]   she was already professional in that area
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.600]   or had those skills and that vision.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.840]   And she waited until the kids were old enough
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.760]   to go to school because we had five kids.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.080]   Some of them were pretty little.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.520]   They were in school age.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.360]   But yeah, she started the school with,
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.080]   in a house with a couple of kids
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:20.920]   and three of them were ours.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.280]   - And today it's one of the leading private schools
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.120]   here in Costa Rica, right?
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.840]   - Yeah, it was pretty much the first all IB school
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.120]   and it's bi-trilingual.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.280]   There's pretty much a waiting list to get in.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.560]   There are 500 and some odd kids in the school.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.320]   But it was not that when it started.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.680]   It was when it started,
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.400]   it was pretty close to a one-room schoolhouse.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.280]   It was actually a house that we bought
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.960]   that one, the bedroom was second grade
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.760]   and another room was first grade.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.840]   And there was a little patio outside
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.520]   and that was the playground.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.200]   And that was the school.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.120]   - So you taught, so your children matriculated
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.200]   through the school, the international school
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.720]   that your wife oversaw.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.760]   Then did they go to university in the United States,
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.040]   here in Costa Rica, in Europe?
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.120]   How did they handle their educational process?
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.960]   - All of that.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.800]   - All of that, okay.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.720]   - Yeah, there's one that went to Europe,
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.440]   two that went to the United States,
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.760]   one that went to Costa Rica,
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.040]   one who sort of went from place to place.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.280]   Yeah, there was all of the above.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.640]   - Okay, so what was your philosophy as a father
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.040]   and an entrepreneur towards the involvement
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.720]   of your children in your family businesses?
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:58.120]   - Well, it wasn't, I don't know if I sat down
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.640]   and had a philosophy, nor did my wife,
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.320]   but it was, there was, two of my children
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.560]   had a very natural connection to the school.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.720]   And everybody is, everybody's different
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.400]   'cause one of our children went and studied in France
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.480]   and was there, and had a no natural connection
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.520]   to any of the things that we're doing except to the family.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.520]   So I think that it's,
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:34.920]   there was, there's something organic here that went on
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:39.640]   because, for example, one of my sons who now is in,
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.240]   now is one of the two sons that are running the company,
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:47.000]   I remember when he was 11 or 12, he said,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.600]   "I just wanna carry some," he's a very strong guy,
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.400]   and he said, "I wanna carry one of these bags,
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.240]   "these are 69 kilo bags that people, that they'd coffee,"
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.760]   he says, "and then when I get older,
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:01.360]   "I'll do more sophisticated stuff."
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.360]   So he was really, and the other son also worked,
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.520]   worked in coffee mills and ended up working,
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.920]   ended up being a body stead Starbucks on Times Square,
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.680]   which was at that time the Starbucks that sold,
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.120]   that had most traffic of any Starbucks, you know,
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.800]   and so they ended up,
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:30.160]   without us doing very much
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.520]   or pushing them in any particular direction,
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.320]   two of them were attracted to the school world
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.240]   and two of them were attracted to the coffee world.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:45.760]   And so they ended up running things.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.080]   (laughing)
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:52.080]   That's sort of the, it became fairly natural
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.700]   for that to take place.
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:59.800]   - Do you think, so I would say back then, right,
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.720]   30 years ago, without question,
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.640]   Costa Rica would have qualified as, I guess,
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.000]   what maybe you would have called a frontier market
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.640]   in college, something like that.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.200]   I don't think it qualifies that today.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.600]   I mean, I don't think of this as much of a frontier market,
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.000]   but do you think that your children,
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.560]   how would you, how do you think your children's experience
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.680]   was growing up here in Costa Rica
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.360]   as compared to if you had stayed in the United States
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.920]   or if you and your family had gone to France
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.920]   or to some other kind of place?
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.080]   How do you think their experience compared?
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:43.220]   - Well, first of all,
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:47.740]   they grew up around, I would say that my wife
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.560]   and I are both entrepreneurs.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.780]   We both sort of defined our lives.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:57.940]   And I have a feeling that if you grow up in the States,
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.040]   it's harder to find your life.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.580]   It's harder to find your life.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:08.820]   You end up either you're working for somebody else
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.500]   or you're working for yourself,
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:14.580]   but there are lots of rules
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.420]   and there are lots of rules that are written or unwritten.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:24.740]   And maybe rules is a very restrictive term,
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:32.140]   but it's sort of, a lot of things have already been invented.
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:38.940]   Whereas as you, the word that used frontier market,
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:43.700]   where you are is you can invent things.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.700]   I mean, my wife invented a school.
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.820]   She just, she didn't go and buy somebody else's school
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.300]   or open up a book and say,
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.760]   "Well, this is how the school should be."
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.220]   She said, "Well, here, this is how I want the school to be.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.940]   "This is the curriculum that I want."
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.340]   And she actually wrote the curriculum.
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.040]   And these are the things that I,
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:06.460]   and nobody got in their way in doing that,
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:10.060]   and sort of the same thing that happened with us.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:15.060]   So I think that we were lucky to be,
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.060]   as you say, in the frontier,
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:23.000]   in a world where, or in a country where,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.440]   everything hadn't already been established.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:32.020]   And also, and I think I have to be fair about this also,
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.620]   we were in a world without YouTube.
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.700]   'Cause these days you could sort of have that idea,
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.620]   and if you don't have the idea, you could look on YouTube,
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.500]   and somebody else has that idea and has put it on YouTube
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.580]   or put it on the internet.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:50.580]   So we had that advantage of being able to have an idea
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.580]   and turn it into something,
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.580]   and be an innovator in that sense.
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:01.360]   So I think, and my children are no longer children.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.100]   They're in their late 30s and 40s.
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:08.100]   So they grew up still in that world of,
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:12.560]   with that level of freedom.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.740]   Now, obviously, there's another level of,
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:19.260]   there's another whole level of freedom now,
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:23.980]   which is very hard for me to understand completely,
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.060]   understand how one would operate in it,
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.460]   which has to do with the fact that information's free,
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:35.380]   and that you can end up having an idea
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.980]   and then finding out best practices
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.680]   by just looking on your telephone.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:44.060]   - When you think about,
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:50.500]   so I think a lot about family wealth and legacy, right?
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.820]   I have four children, and I think about
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.420]   how do I train them in such a way
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:01.420]   that they have abundant opportunities,
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:06.780]   but so that they identify with the family enterprise?
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.580]   I used to think, oh, the way to go is just
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.580]   that children have to do it all themselves, right?
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:14.500]   They start off from scratch, and they do it all themselves.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.100]   And then I realized that I was really wrong about that.
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:22.020]   So you want to kind of balance a healthy mix of,
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:26.060]   here, we're here to support you.
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.300]   You don't have to come and work in the family business.
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.340]   You're free to go to France and build your own career
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.900]   as one of your children has done.
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.540]   You're not under restraint.
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:39.540]   But in your case, you've built this powerful family legacy
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.180]   that two of your children are involved
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.440]   with the European School,
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.260]   two of your children are involved with Café Brit.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.140]   As I understand it, you've ceded
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.620]   most of the operating control over to them,
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.380]   and so this can continue to be a powerful brand.
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.460]   And you said that your children have massively grown
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.380]   the brand even beyond what it was
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.820]   when you were running everything, right?
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.740]   - Sure, absolutely.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.900]   - So what advice do you have from your perspective
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.740]   for a young father about how to cultivate
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.260]   and kind of inculcate a culture
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.160]   of family identity with your children?
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:22.080]   - Well, one thing is,
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.360]   I've never really thought through that.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.560]   I've never thought of that question before.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.100]   I haven't given that as much thought as you,
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:39.120]   'cause we didn't sit down and write a series of rules.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.240]   But I guess the first thing I think about
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.620]   is that we are a family.
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.600]   That is, everything we were doing
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.080]   that our children knew about
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.200]   and were very much aware about it.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:59.200]   And so the border between business or work and life
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:07.680]   was very, very porous.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:14.080]   I can imagine somebody who comes home from work at night
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.080]   and they say, "How was work, Daddy?"
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.360]   And he says, "Let's turn on the TV," or something else.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.900]   Or he tries to explain what it is,
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:28.900]   but that doesn't really mean very much to a young kid.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.520]   Whereas in our case,
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.440]   if you're now running the school
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.960]   where you went as a child,
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.640]   you actually knew what was going on.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.760]   At the dinner table, your mom was talking about
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.160]   needing to hire an English teacher,
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.000]   and those teachers actually lived at the house.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.380]   What she generally did was when a teacher came from abroad
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:02.360]   before working in the school, we'd invite them to stay over.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:07.320]   So you got to know them, and some of them stayed over,
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.540]   and then didn't end up being in the school too.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:16.620]   So, and then if my older children,
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.800]   they'd see me, there are coffee trees right around the house
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.540]   and there's a warehouse down at the end of the road,
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:29.540]   and they grew up around what we were doing.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:36.040]   So I guess that's a long way of saying,
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.540]   yeah, we were a family for 24 hours a day.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:44.960]   There weren't aspects of our lives
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.360]   that were not shared with our kids.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:53.720]   And I don't,
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:39:00.000]   and it wasn't anything that we imposed on them.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.840]   But if you think about history,
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.160]   think about what people did in the Middle Ages
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.920]   or people did in the front,
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.280]   and think about the American frontier,
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.240]   that's what happened.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.460]   People grew up and somebody take care of the,
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.760]   somebody built the cows,
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.680]   and they helped dad out in the farm,
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:26.680]   or if they're pioneers and going across the country,
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:31.800]   there wasn't that strong borderline between work and life,
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:37.820]   which is also a little,
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:42.820]   if I have one philosophy is that this idea of retirement,
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:47.580]   this is a very strange concept, it doesn't,
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.640]   sort of like, oh yeah, I'm gonna live
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.200]   once I finish working at the end,
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.940]   and that's usually when people die.
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.320]   - So that's an appropriate transition.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.340]   I was next gonna ask you,
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.360]   one of the taglines of Radical Personal Finance
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.000]   is how to build a plan for financial freedom
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.720]   in 10 years or less.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.120]   And as a former financial advisor,
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.280]   I've spent a lot of time talking to people about retirement.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.580]   Many people have an ambition
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.760]   to someday accumulate enough wealth
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.080]   that they can choose to work if they want to,
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.960]   but not because they have to.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.360]   I think it's safe to say you've been financially successful
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.320]   that you can choose the kinds of work that you do,
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.100]   and you've passed over operational control
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.460]   of Cafe Brit to your children,
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.400]   you're not involved in the day-to-day activities.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.940]   From your perspective now,
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.700]   having reached financial freedom,
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.460]   and thinking about your life now,
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.740]   and your life along that journey,
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.920]   what lessons have you learned
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.540]   that would be helpful to a younger guy like me
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.780]   about financial freedom and retirement?
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.380]   What's great about it, what's difficult about it,
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.940]   how your life changes about it?
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.180]   What lessons do you have for someone like me?
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.360]   - Well, as I said before, I don't believe in retirement.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.120]   In other words, I just think
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.880]   that you have phases in your life,
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.620]   and you just have to,
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:19.240]   you wanna optimize your lifestyle or your life experience
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.640]   in those different phases, that's all.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:28.320]   I didn't invent that, I mean, the Greeks did.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.680]   So it's not a,
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:35.340]   and I guess,
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:43.200]   I've never really thought about financial freedom
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:48.720]   as a goal.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:54.880]   That is that I and my wife, both of us,
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.720]   we've always sort of lived within our means.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:02.040]   That is whatever we happen to have as an income,
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.080]   especially since we were both building businesses,
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.360]   which meant that we had a piece of land,
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.640]   and it was always mortgaged, for example.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:16.840]   But it's partially because
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:24.480]   we're really lucky to not have to,
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:30.080]   when I think about people who pay $5,000
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.600]   for a two-room apartment in New York,
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.100]   so one and a half-room apartment in New York City,
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:38.000]   'cause they wanna live in New York City,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.880]   or people who right now
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:51.720]   have to really think about saving that last bit of money
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.520]   because the cost of living is so high.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:02.280]   Whereas we're living on a farm,
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:07.320]   and we bought it 45 years ago when you could do that.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:12.360]   So there hasn't ever been a serious issue
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:19.720]   about saying, well, if we save up enough,
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.520]   then we don't have to work anymore
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:26.520]   because there is a sort of a continuum
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.520]   of activities that we're doing.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:37.580]   So what does that mean in terms of advice for you?
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.880]   I don't think I can give you any advice
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.520]   considering what you said,
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.140]   the way you're considering living your life.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:49.480]   I think that you're thinking about living your life,
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   if I was your age now, I'd probably do what you're doing.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.720]   I think that you don't wanna be,
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.960]   you certainly don't wanna,
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.600]   you wanna be able to be the author of your own book, right?
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.640]   You don't wanna have other people
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.880]   or other organizations telling you what you're doing.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.920]   And you wanna be the, and maybe not even
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.040]   the author of your own book,
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.960]   maybe the journalist of your own newspaper,
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.400]   'cause you're going to be doing investigative journalism
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.600]   all of your life.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:28.600]   You're gonna be looking and being,
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:32.800]   and enjoying discovering things
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.080]   that you feel that you wanna be involved in
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.320]   and rejecting things you don't wanna be involved in.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:43.400]   So, and if you're, as you told me that you were,
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.720]   that you lived in a house trailer with all your kids
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.240]   and traveled around the United States
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:53.240]   for a while, I think that you also have that idea
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:58.920]   that that line between your work life and your life life
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.080]   is not, doesn't exist.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.320]   So, I think that probably,
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.680]   if I'm thinking about one bit of advice
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.800]   or one thing that I think was successful for us
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.880]   is never drawing that line.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.360]   - Yeah, it's one of the things
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.960]   that I love the most about my current lifestyle.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:26.320]   My wife and I are with our children 168 hours a week, right?
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.560]   One of us is.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.400]   And I'm not sure that we'll always do that.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.720]   I think there are very good reasons
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.040]   to enroll a child in a school,
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.640]   many good reasons to encourage children
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.720]   to pursue their own things
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.480]   that might be physically separate.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.160]   I don't believe that 168 hours a week is the standard,
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:50.320]   but I do love, I really love being able to have
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.160]   that kind of integrated life
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:57.160]   because it feels very natural and right.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:01.160]   This is how our forebears for millennia have lived, right?
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:04.420]   Children haven't been sent off away from dad and mom.
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.060]   There's always been an integrated family life,
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.400]   an integrated village life, an integrated life
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.840]   where there's intergenerational sharing
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:17.840]   and transfer and teaching and social interaction.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.300]   And it's something I value very greatly.
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.800]   Go ahead.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.720]   - There's a, I was thinking about something
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.560]   that I read a long time ago,
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:31.400]   which is a pretty simple little aphorism.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   It says if you follow your passions for work,
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.640]   you'll never work a day in your life.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.840]   - Yeah, I feel that way.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.080]   And even as an entrepreneur,
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.600]   it's interesting the comment you made earlier
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.280]   about kind of the choice between,
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.880]   well, you can go to New York City
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.320]   and you can make X number of hundreds of thousands dollars
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.720]   a year and work on the 25th floor
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.040]   and have two weeks of vacation.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.140]   And you said, I'm in a frontier market, right?
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.480]   I'm an entrepreneur.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.560]   I can enjoy a really interesting integrated lifestyle.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.960]   I'm on my motorcycle traveling all around Costa Rica,
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.440]   visiting coffee mills,
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:11.600]   and I don't have to account for every moment of every day.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.640]   I work hard, but I have a lifestyle
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.760]   where I'm not on the clock in that sense.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:21.400]   And it's interesting because I'm not as wealthy as you are.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.400]   I'm a good bit younger,
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.900]   but because of being an entrepreneur,
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:33.080]   I am enjoying in many ways a very similar lifestyle to you
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.600]   as an experienced wealthy,
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.960]   I won't use the word retiree,
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.040]   but what a lot of people would say,
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.920]   oh, this person is retired in the sense
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.800]   that doesn't run this one active business.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.480]   You're involved in many things.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.720]   And to me, that's the power of entrepreneurship, right?
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.120]   You can write your own ticket
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:52.680]   and you can enjoy from the age of 25 to the age of 75,
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.600]   you can enjoy that sense of control
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.360]   and a more relaxed and appropriate pace of your life.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:02.160]   If when you take responsibility for your business
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.560]   and for your life, and you know,
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.800]   if it's to be, it's up to me, right?
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.520]   I gotta make it happen.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.240]   That also comes with it,
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.960]   the reward of being able to have a more integrated lifestyle
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.560]   and more enjoyable days, at least in my experience.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:19.720]   - I think you've summarized it better than I could have.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.480]   - So here's my final question.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.200]   I believe the strategies that you have used
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   are very powerful strategies for other people to consider.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.880]   And I'll just identify them.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.240]   I don't think they're right for everybody,
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.920]   but I think there are strategies
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.000]   that are good for other people to consider.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.520]   So for example, leaving the country of one's birth
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:43.760]   and going to another place can often help someone
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.960]   to be an exotic foreigner,
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.120]   which comes with it a certain amount
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.440]   of benefit, of prestige, right?
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:53.440]   Your wife could be the exotic French woman
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.360]   who's opening the European school.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:00.040]   And while she may have the exact same qualifications
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:04.000]   as a native born Costa Rican in Costa Rica,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.680]   she'll have a little bit of that exotic ability
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.480]   from her being abroad.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:12.000]   Similar for you being the US American businessman
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:12.920]   working here.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.160]   There are downsides to it as well,
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.840]   but you get some more valuable access.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.640]   And then I think also when you go to a frontier market,
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.440]   a lot of times you have less competition.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.800]   If you had been in that New York City office,
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.880]   there would have been lots and lots of people competing
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.720]   for that because there's lots of candidates.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.360]   But here you had fewer competitors
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.840]   competing for the exact thing.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:36.600]   And so I frequently recommend to,
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.480]   if a young guy wants to go and make his fortune,
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.760]   I say, take a corner of the world that you're interested in,
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.720]   go and check it out
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:45.040]   and see what opportunities come along the way.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.320]   And you may look back later and say,
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.120]   I was really lucky because of this trend
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.440]   of the coffee growing and whatnot.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.560]   And you were, right?
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.800]   But the reality is you saw something happening
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.720]   and you took advantage of it.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:57.720]   And I believe that,
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.800]   well, I don't know what those opportunities are
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.480]   for me right now or for someone else.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.960]   We can be open to them and looking for them.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.160]   So here's my question.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:12.120]   If you were starting over again today,
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:15.040]   you know, a young 25-year-old guy, something like that,
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.000]   what are some of the regions and/or industries
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.200]   that you have noticed that you think,
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   you know what, I bet there's some opportunity there,
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.760]   some of the countries, some of the regions,
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.560]   and some of the industries that you think
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.920]   would be worth checking out and investigating?
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.120]   - Well, I mean, the industry parts,
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:37.000]   it's not gonna sound very original,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.360]   but I think that it's really important
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.480]   to think about two things.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.760]   You think about anything to do with climate change
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.240]   or circular economy or things like that.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.520]   And you wanna think about things
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.280]   that have to do with people.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:55.480]   You know, there's this,
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:59.840]   one of my sort of mentors said,
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.240]   "You know, if everybody's walking north,
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.160]   "you should start walking south
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.040]   "because one day they're gonna end up there."
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.960]   So, you know, the standard thing to say is,
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.560]   "Well, the future's all about tech.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.640]   "It's all about algorithms.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.720]   "It's all about artificial intelligence.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.640]   "It's all about robotics and stuff like that."
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:24.560]   And I think that there's gonna be a lot of opportunities
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.840]   of things that have to do with high touch,
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.480]   with things that have to do with, you know,
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:34.360]   I have a theater, things that have to do with,
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:39.880]   instead of ordering stuff online,
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:43.320]   having a restaurant or a cafe
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:48.320]   where you don't take a iPad and order things,
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.480]   but you actually talk to somebody.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.200]   So, you know, so that's just examples,
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.000]   but I think that Evan, as I said before,
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:02.840]   anything to do, and I think that it's more interesting
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:06.040]   to think about things that have to do
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.920]   with circular economy than to say,
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.440]   "Well, I'm gonna plant more trees."
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.560]   - What do you mean, circular economy?
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.720]   - Not throwing stuff out.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.200]   - Okay, so-- - Figuring out ways
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.800]   to use stuff that people think should be thrown out.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.640]   - Got it.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:23.480]   - Or use, or being able to maximize resources in other ways.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.880]   You know, lots of things you can do with petroleum.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.120]   - Right, right. - That's not burning it.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.440]   You know, we have an economy that has to do,
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.040]   which is, you know, it's linear.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.760]   We make stuff, and then we throw it out.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.020]   - Right. - And the more stuff
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:39.920]   we can make and the more stuff we can throw out,
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.800]   the more the GMP grows.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:44.240]   Well, that isn't the way-- - It's destructive, right.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.920]   - That isn't the way it's gonna be.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.240]   - Right, absolutely. - You know?
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:51.000]   I'm not even putting any moral label on it.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.480]   - It just doesn't make sense. - It's destructive.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.760]   - It may serve you for a time,
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.280]   but it doesn't make sense in the long run.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.600]   - Yeah, and that isn't where we're going.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:01.280]   And that's probably the only thing
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:04.640]   that artificial intelligence and all this handling
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.240]   of information is telling you,
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:10.760]   that you can optimize the use of resources
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:15.600]   and find all sorts of other uses to resources
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.520]   than just throwing them out.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:23.520]   So those are the two things that I would focus on.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:28.120]   - Are there any particular regions or countries
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.840]   of the world that are interesting to you?
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:34.040]   Or that would be in the way that I laid it out?
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:39.040]   - Well, this is gonna get into sort of personal,
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:45.600]   personal preferences, right?
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.600]   So, I mean, and you can put it two ways, right?
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.120]   There are people who really like risk
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.600]   and there's probably a good return
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.360]   if you can handle a lot of risk.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:03.840]   But if you're gonna have a family,
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.120]   you sort of wanna look the other way.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:09.640]   You wanna be in a place which is relatively safe,
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:13.320]   which has a social contract that's working.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:20.280]   And maybe that may end up being places
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.720]   that have actually had a war
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:28.720]   and are now recovering from it because they know.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:33.200]   We were talking earlier about former Yugoslavia
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.000]   and Bosnia may be a place like that.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.160]   But there's other places that have had a war
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.200]   and haven't figured it out yet.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.560]   Nicaragua was a good example of that,
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.520]   a place that it went through a very nice period
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.840]   of saying, well, you were tired of having wars
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:56.160]   and then things are going up again.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:01.160]   So, but that's a little side thing.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:06.680]   But I do think that, or I was gonna say,
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:08.560]   I was pretty impressed with,
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:15.040]   I was sort of hired as a consultant in Rwanda for a while
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:18.080]   to take a look at the coffee industry there.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.600]   And I was really surprised
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.520]   at how well things worked in Rwanda.
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:25.440]   One of the things that they,
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.640]   one of the first things that I saw was I went
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:33.720]   to the Rwandan agency that handles foreign investors
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:38.120]   and the lady sent me down and she said,
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:43.120]   "I really wanna apologize because it only takes six hours
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.200]   "for you to start a company
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.880]   "and do all the steps to start a business.
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:50.480]   "We've really wanted to get it down to two,
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.960]   "but we haven't been able to do that."
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.680]   And all the offices were in the,
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.720]   it was a three-story building,
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.760]   you could do everything you needed to do
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.560]   to start a company.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.800]   So it takes about, in Costa Rica, it takes about two years.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.240]   (both laughing)
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.960]   Minimum, and a lot of help.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:11.800]   And in the United States, it takes a while too.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.680]   And it costs you a lot of money per hour to people.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:20.400]   So Rwanda may not be a really good example right now
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.880]   because it's gone through,
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:25.960]   it's recently gone through a lot of problems.
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:30.000]   But I would, I'd sort of look at that list
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.040]   and there's those lists are all published
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:36.000]   about how easy it is to start a business.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.400]   And that would be another, so that I'd,
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:46.000]   instead of, as I pointed to individual countries,
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.880]   I'd look at those types of characteristics.
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:52.880]   I'd look at a social contract that seems to be working,
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:58.240]   that there's some level of safety.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:04.120]   And that it is,
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.320]   and that whatever it is, the government,
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:11.680]   or whatever the, or even the culture,
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.600]   because sometimes it's not the government,
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:18.600]   it's culture that says, that's friendly to people
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.880]   from outside who have ideas.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.640]   And I'm saying that because, you know,
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.600]   you have, there are cultures which think
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.880]   that it's really a bad idea to make money.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.440]   You know, it's, ah, that's sort of,
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.360]   it's sort of contrary to their thinking.
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:39.360]   Or there are cultures that have very, very strong elites
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:42.200]   and say, you know, I just wanna keep it.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.520]   If anybody wants to try to make money, we'll--
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.480]   - It's just gonna be us. - Yeah.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:51.480]   So that's why I'm saying that it's not only
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:55.360]   the rules and regulations, it's also the cultures.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.540]   So you put that in some sort of a,
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:04.360]   you put, you have to put that in some sort of a sieve
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.920]   and sort of look through it,
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:11.800]   and you'll, probably some countries might pop out.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.480]   You know, Estonia might pop out,
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:18.480]   or Bosnia might pop out, or Mongolia.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.840]   Mongolia probably won't pop out, but it could.
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.000]   - Right. - It could.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.960]   But, you know, Georgia, they do that too.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:34.480]   The only problem is, you know,
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.440]   I'm talking about ex-communist countries,
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:42.280]   the problem is that you do have, in some of these places,
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:47.280]   you have some really strong elites, new elites that really,
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:50.080]   they haven't quite, not as good as old elites,
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.240]   but they're getting there.
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.520]   - Right, right. - So.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:54.920]   - No, I agree.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.640]   I think that it's one of the things
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:00.400]   that makes me a little sad about our home country,
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.320]   United States, just feels like sometimes
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:06.360]   there's been so much success that it just feels to me
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.680]   like the way that we got there
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.760]   has been kind of forgotten about.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:14.840]   But I often don't get that same experience and sense
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:17.240]   in a place that remembers pretty recently
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:18.280]   how rough things were.
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:21.240]   It's like, well, we did that socialism thing.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.280]   That was pretty rough.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.360]   We're pretty glad now to have this opportunity that we have.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:30.080]   And it feels like those memories are a little fresher,
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.520]   and it inspires more confidence,
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:33.760]   more of a desire to work hard,
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:35.720]   more of an appreciation of opportunity
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.400]   than sometimes I sense in some of the other places
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.240]   that we're from.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.560]   - Yeah, and it changes, right?
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.040]   I was gonna, what you just said occurs to me
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:50.080]   that an experience that we had in Café Brit
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:55.080]   is that we opened this representative office in the EU.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.640]   And you know where it is?
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:59.720]   It's in Riga, Latvia.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:00.560]   - Yeah.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:04.000]   - And it was quite successful,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.400]   quite successful because of our partner
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:11.400]   who was an entrepreneur who actually made his money
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:16.560]   by building gym equipment, by importing gym equipment.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.520]   And right when the wall came down,
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.480]   he said, "I gotta find something.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.620]   "There's gotta be some things that are gonna happen here
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.800]   "that didn't happen before."
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.800]   And he somehow came on the idea of gyms and hotels.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.040]   And he noticed that in the West,
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:40.040]   people that all hotels had machines in them.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:44.320]   So he got the representation for machines.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.040]   And now in Latvia, not only do hotels
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.200]   have really good machines,
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.120]   but you see gyms on the street.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:55.960]   - Right.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.120]   - Walk on the street, see it.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.120]   So it's in a certain way,
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.640]   that may be the idea of walking South
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.880]   when people are walking North.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.200]   But the other way, the other part of that story
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.200]   is to say you're probably be more successful
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.280]   doing things that other people are not doing.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.520]   - Right.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.540]   - Maybe what you wanna do is sort of,
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.160]   consultants will do things like that.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.760]   People will say to you,
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:33.120]   well, let's see what's the 90%,
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.920]   let's look at that bell curve and say,
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.520]   here, these are areas that have really been successful.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.220]   And so really what you really wanna do is say,
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:41.460]   well, look at the tails of the bell curve.
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:44.760]   Say, let's look at the ones that people haven't looked at.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.160]   Or maybe the ones that haven't been successful, why?
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.000]   - Right.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.340]   - There's probably a bigger return to that.
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.440]   - Yeah, I think, what's the old joke, right?
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.920]   Invert, always invert, right?
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.200]   I always think of the nation of Bhutan.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.920]   From a tourism perspective, as I understand the story,
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.880]   I can't confirm this firsthand,
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.440]   but I understand the story.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.760]   Bhutan was trying to figure out,
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:10.680]   how do we appeal more on the tourist market?
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.380]   And so they hired consultants,
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.780]   and those consultants said,
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:16.340]   well, you need to go ahead
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.240]   and make it easier for people to come
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.040]   and build more tourist infrastructure
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.700]   so you can have more people come.
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.200]   But they looked at it and they decided,
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.040]   you know what, we're gonna go
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.040]   in the exact opposite direction.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.440]   And so Bhutan is, the kingdom of Bhutan
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.280]   is incredibly difficult to get into.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.760]   Everyone has to get a visa.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.320]   You can't come in without a tour.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.920]   You have to book a tour guide.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.160]   You have to commit, I think a minimum tour
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.120]   is $250 a day for a person.
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.440]   And so all the tourism is high-end.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.520]   And so what they have done is built
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.880]   this tourist infrastructure that's all very high-end,
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.080]   very high-dollar tourist infrastructure.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.760]   But it's allowing the kingdom of Bhutan
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.160]   to be a very exotic and unique destination.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.360]   And when travelers go there, they find,
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.440]   hey, we're not overloaded with $1 T-shirts
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.940]   and people hawking cheap stuff to us.
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:12.200]   This is a really beautiful, amazing tourist experience
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.120]   that we're having.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.980]   But it's because Bhutan chose to go to the opposite end.
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:20.260]   And so as you say, in a world in which
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:23.080]   you can order your food so easily through an app
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.520]   and it'll show up a few minutes later,
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.200]   all of a sudden now, having a nice experience in a cafe
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.920]   becomes that much more powerful.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.440]   It's not to say you can't get wealthy
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.400]   selling food through an app.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.220]   You can.
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.040]   But you can always look and say,
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.940]   all right, if the market is going this way,
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.360]   can I serve that market?
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:42.800]   Or maybe I can go the other way and find a market
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.520]   that I can serve effectively.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:48.160]   - Well, I'll tell you another little anecdote
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.720]   from our past, which is one of these little anecdotes.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.040]   Anecdotes that you use to live by,
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.840]   they get a little bit more sort of fairy tale-ish
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.760]   as you think about them.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.600]   But when we started Mail Order,
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:09.560]   we had this consultant who was the fellow who was doing the,
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.560]   it was a company that sent out flyers
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.040]   and had mailing lists and stuff like that.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.120]   'Cause there was a whole world out there
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:22.120]   of mail order prior to online e-commerce.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.160]   And so we started to talk about,
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.120]   well, which coffee products would be best
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.600]   and where they should be,
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.240]   and let's look at where everything is
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.720]   and what people are buying.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:40.160]   And let's look at what's the most popular stuff
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.200]   and look at the different areas.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.920]   And he said, "Wait a second.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.180]   "All you guys need is one suburb of St. Louis
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.180]   "to sell your whole product.
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:55.180]   "So why don't you just think about being sharpshooters
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:05:00.560]   "rather than dropping Adam Bobsog things?"
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.160]   And he was right.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:07.320]   That's a very, it's, you wanna do your own thing
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:12.320]   and you wanna be an entrepreneur and be successful,
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:15.920]   you don't have to be Bill Gates.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.180]   You just have to be who you are and maximize who you are.
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:22.260]   - I love it.
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:24.700]   Steve, thank you so much for coming on the show.
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.060]   Is there anything you'd like to promote as we go?
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.420]   Obviously, the Cafe Brit is there.
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:29.620]   Anyone who goes through an airport in Latin America
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:30.820]   can enjoy some Cafe Brit.
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:31.660]   - No, I'm fine.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.920]   - Yeah, any other products or projects
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.220]   that you'd like to share with my audience
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.420]   about what you're working on right now?
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:39.380]   - Well, I'm working on a whole series
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:41.420]   of circular economy ones.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.580]   Actually, the coolest thing we're doing,
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.380]   the coolest thing that I'm involved in
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:50.060]   as a minority shareholder is a company
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:55.060]   that collects used oil, that is used lubricant.
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.420]   It's when you change lubricant in your car,
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:01.780]   most of it gets thrown away or burned,
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:04.620]   ends up being carbon.
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:08.020]   And actually, there are processes
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:13.020]   that you can re-refine that lubricant
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:17.220]   and get out of the 100% lubricant,
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:21.540]   you get 80% of base oil,
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.820]   which you can then just add additives to
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:25.540]   and then you have lubricant again.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.260]   And the other 20% is asphalt.
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:33.580]   So that what used to be just thrown into the rivers
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:38.500]   or burned actually just becomes something that can be reused.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:39.340]   - I love it.
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:42.180]   I am convinced that 30 years from now,
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:44.140]   maybe it's 30 years, 50 years, I don't know.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.460]   But I am convinced that over the next couple of decades,
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:51.460]   to your point about circular economy, as you say,
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.780]   we're going to solve so many of these problems
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:55.280]   in the next couple of decades.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:59.180]   So many items of pollution.
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.900]   Just yesterday, a couple of days ago,
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:04.100]   I saw this amazing video of this young Kenyan engineer.
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:07.320]   And she had invented and is working on perfecting
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:11.380]   a process of turning plastic garbage into bricks.
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.860]   And she had created these really high quality plastic bricks
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:17.820]   with a very simple thing and she spent years working on it.
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:20.220]   But when you can go into a nation like Kenya
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:23.500]   or Costa Rica or anywhere and take all that plastic,
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.660]   and even though Kenya now bans plastic bags,
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.220]   but there's still just everywhere,
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:30.080]   take that plastic and turn it into high quality bricks
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.980]   for pavers, high quality bricks for building,
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:33.100]   it's phenomenal.
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:36.060]   So whether it's lubricants or really anything,
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.740]   I'm convinced a few decades from now,
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:42.180]   we're gonna see a massive transformation
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:45.300]   where a lot of these lines of waste are gonna be cut off.
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:48.660]   And much of the waste that is there already
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:51.460]   is going to be upcycled.
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.860]   And we're gonna figure out how to use it more effectively.
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:55.780]   Because whenever there's a resource like that,
[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.260]   someone's gonna find a way to use it.
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:59.100]   - Yeah, you just reminded me of something
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:02.660]   that I think is really cool that I'm involved
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.340]   at a national parks NGO.
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:08.100]   One of the things that we do is we replace
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:16.060]   some of the railings and the wooden lookouts
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:21.180]   that you use, which in the tropics don't last very long.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.500]   And we replace them with plastic wood.
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:28.420]   And plastic wood is wood, looks like wood, acts like wood,
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:32.940]   but it's made out of the caps of all.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:34.660]   And we collect caps all over the country.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.660]   You probably have seen even these things.
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:42.980]   We collect the plastic caps and you can also use things,
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:46.620]   like there's other very strange things, like hospitals.
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:53.020]   In operating rooms, people use plastic aprons and things.
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:58.180]   And they use them once, they throw them out.
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:59.740]   Well, you can turn that into wood.
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:00.580]   - Awesome.
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:02.700]   - So there's national parks in Costa Rica
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.020]   that have lookouts made out of plastic wood.
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.380]   - Perfect, yeah.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:11.380]   With human engineering, all of these problems are solvable.
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:14.660]   I mean, even every ecological problem,
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:16.380]   like all of these things are solvable,
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:18.900]   but it takes smart men and women to buckle down
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:20.460]   and do the work and find it.
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.980]   So Steve, thank you for coming on the show today.
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:22.820]   I really appreciate it.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:24.700]   - No, no, it was fun, thank you.
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:28.180]   - Have you experienced Slotzilla?
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:31.860]   The world's ultimate zip line is at Fremont Street Experience
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:34.140]   in fabulous downtown Las Vegas.
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.740]   Enjoy the thrill with two ways to fly.
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:39.780]   Take off on the lower zip line from seven stories high
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:42.380]   and fly three blocks down Fremont Street.
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:45.700]   The upper zoom line launches flyer superhero style
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:48.400]   from 11 stories, traveling five blocks
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.900]   under the world's largest video screen.
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:53.740]   Come zip or zoom Vegas style.
