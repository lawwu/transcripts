[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   So let's talk about the optimal way to engage in activities
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.520]   or to consume things that evoke dopamine.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.760]   How are we supposed to engage
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.120]   with these dopamine evoking activities
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.440]   in ways that are healthy and beneficial for us?
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.160]   How do we achieve these peaks,
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.800]   which are so central to our wellbeing
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.980]   and experience of life without dropping our baseline?
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.980]   And the key lies in intermittent release of dopamine.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.200]   The real key is to not expect or chase high levels
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.680]   of dopamine release every time we engage
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.400]   in these activities.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.680]   Now, the smartphone is a very interesting tool
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.620]   for dopamine in light of all this.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.820]   It's extremely common nowadays to see people texting
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.840]   and doing selfies and communicating in various ways,
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.320]   listening to podcasts, listening to music,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.280]   doing all sorts of things while they engage
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.920]   in other activities or going to dinner
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.520]   and texting other people or making plans,
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.320]   sharing information, that's all wonderful.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.220]   It gives depth and richness and color to life.
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.560]   But it isn't just about our distracted nature
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.280]   when we're engaging with the phone.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.980]   It's also a way of layering in dopamine.
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.320]   And it's no surprise that levels of depression
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.720]   and lack of motivation are really on the increase.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.140]   There's something called dopamine reward prediction error.
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.480]   When we expect something to happen,
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.500]   we are highly motivated to pursue it.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.280]   If it happens, great, we get the reward.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.240]   The reward comes in various chemical forms,
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.600]   including dopamine, and we are more likely
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   to engage in that behavior again.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.160]   This is the basis of casino gambling.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.400]   This is how they keep you going back
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.040]   again and again and again, even though on average,
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.720]   the house really does win.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.920]   Everything that we've talked about until now
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.120]   sets up an explanation or an interpretation
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.800]   of why interacting with digital technology
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.980]   can potentially lead to disruptions
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.840]   or lowering in baseline levels of dopamine.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.860]   There's a intermittent schedule
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.920]   by which dopamine sometimes arrives,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.040]   sometimes a little bit, sometimes a lot,
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.560]   sometimes a medium amount, okay?
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.920]   That intermittent reinforcement schedule
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   is actually the best schedule to export to other activities.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.640]   How do you do that?
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.180]   Well, first of all, if you are engaged in activities,
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.480]   school, sport, relationship, et cetera,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.820]   where you experience a win,
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.520]   you should be very careful about allowing yourself
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.820]   to experience huge peaks in dopamine,
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.220]   unless you're willing to suffer the crash that follows
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.760]   and waiting a period of time for it to come back up.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.680]   What would this look like in the practical sense?
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.920]   Well, let's say you are somebody
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.080]   who really does enjoy exercise,
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.360]   or let's say you're somebody who kind of likes exercise,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.000]   but forces yourself to do it,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.220]   but you make it pleasureful
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.160]   by giving yourself your favorite cup of coffee first,
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.220]   or maybe taking a pre-workout drink,
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.840]   or taking an energy drink,
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.360]   or listening to your favorite music,
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.160]   and then you're in the gym and you're listening to your music
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.780]   that all sounds great, right?
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.960]   Well, it is great, except that by layering together
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.520]   all these things to try and achieve that dopamine release,
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.480]   and by getting a big peak in dopamine,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.620]   you're actually increasing the number of conditions required
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.720]   to achieve pleasure from that activity again.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.460]   I can use a personal example for this.
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.080]   I happen to really enjoy working out.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.760]   I've always really enjoyed it.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.260]   But in recent years,
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.640]   I noticed that if I was bringing my phone to my workouts,
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.840]   then not only was I a little bit more distracted
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.440]   and not focusing on what I was doing
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.660]   as much as I could have or should have,
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.240]   but also I started to lose interest in what I was doing.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.680]   It wasn't as pleasureful.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.520]   I would feel like it just didn't have the same kind of oomph,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.820]   and I was beginning to question my motivation.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.480]   As I started learning more about this relationship
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.880]   between the peaks and the baselines and dopamine,
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.240]   what I realized was that some time ago,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.400]   I probably experienced a incredible increase
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.760]   in the amount of dopamine during one of my workouts
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.600]   because I enjoy working out and I enjoy listening to music.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.120]   I also enjoy listening to podcasts.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.200]   I also enjoy communicating with people.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.540]   Those are all wonderful pursuits,
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.400]   but I had layered in too many of them too many times.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.800]   And then it essentially wasn't working for me anymore.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.500]   Much in the same way a drug wouldn't work
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.920]   for somebody who takes it repeatedly
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.360]   because their baseline of dopamine is dropping.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.700]   So at least for this calendar year,
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.240]   I've made a rule for myself,
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.240]   which is I don't allow my phone into my workouts at all.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.420]   No music, at least not from the phone.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.520]   It can be in the room.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.760]   I might listen to a podcast in the room,
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.920]   but I don't listen to anything
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.320]   or engage in anything on my phone, no texting whatsoever.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.140]   And most of the time,
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.320]   I just don't even bring it with me for that period of time.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.200]   It's only a short period of time.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.840]   I'm not training that often.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.800]   This is something that I think has been misinterpreted
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.240]   as people can't be alone now.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.740]   People talk about, oh, you know,
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.020]   they can't walk across the street
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.160]   or they can't go anywhere, ride the bus,
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.560]   can't be on the plane without being in contact.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.220]   They can't handle just their thoughts.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.960]   I don't think that's really what's going on.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.200]   I think what's happened is that we achieved
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.240]   the great dopamine increase that comes from
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.980]   this incredible thing, which I personally enjoy
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.560]   being able to communicate by phone, by text,
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.240]   and exchange pictures and send links
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.360]   and these kinds of things, social media.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.080]   But then what happens is it doesn't have
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.480]   that same fulfilling aspect to it.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.840]   And it tends to remove the excitement and the pleasure
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.480]   of the very activities that we are engaged in.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.720]   So I know this is a hard one for many people,
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.440]   but I do invite you to try removing multiple sources
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.660]   of dopamine release or what used to be multiple sources
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.600]   of dopamine release from activities that you want
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.660]   to continue to enjoy or that you want to enjoy more.
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.840]   And now you understand the biological mechanisms
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.600]   that would underlie a statement like that.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.640]   It takes a little bit of working with.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.640]   I know it can be challenging in the first week or so
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.000]   of not engaging with the phone during any kind of workout.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.860]   That actually was really tough,
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.800]   but now I'm back to a place where I enjoy it that much more.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.400]   I also feel as if I conquered something
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.140]   in terms of the circuitry related to dopamine.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.560]   I now understand why something that I enjoyed so much
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.260]   had become less pleasurable for me.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.420]   And there's a deep, deep satisfaction
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.400]   that comes from understanding,
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.480]   okay, there wasn't anything wrong with me
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.280]   or what I was doing or anything at all.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.920]   It was just, there was something wrong
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.200]   with the approach I was taking,
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.520]   which was layering in all these sources of dopamine
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.000]   and dropping my baseline.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.120]   If you want to maintain motivation for school,
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.040]   exercise, relationships, or pursuits of any duration
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.080]   and kind, the key thing is to make sure
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.200]   that the peak in dopamine, if it's very high,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.400]   doesn't occur too often.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.520]   And if something does occur very often,
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.960]   that you vary how much dopamine you experience
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.480]   with each engagement in that activity.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.760]   So do like the casinos do, certainly works for them.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.560]   And for activities that you would like to continue
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.680]   to engage in over time, whatever those happen to be,
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.660]   start paying attention to the amount of dopamine
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.880]   and excitement and pleasure that you achieve with those
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.520]   and start modulating that somewhat at random.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.600]   That might be removing some of the dopamine
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.640]   releasing chemicals that you might take prior.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.560]   Maybe you remove them every time,
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.100]   but then every once in a while you introduce them.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.000]   Maybe it involves sometimes doing things socially
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.120]   that you enjoy doing socially,
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.320]   sometimes doing the same thing, but alone.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.760]   There are a lot of different ways to do this.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.800]   There are a lot of different ways to approach this,
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.400]   but now knowing what you know about peaks
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.240]   and baselines and dopamine and understanding
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.500]   how important it is not just to achieve peaks,
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.940]   but to maintain that baseline at a healthy level,
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.040]   it should be straightforward for you to implement
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.560]   these intermittent schedules.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.140]   [upbeat music]
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.540]   [upbeat music]
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.320]   (upbeat music)
