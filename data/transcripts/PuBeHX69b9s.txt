[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   Why do you like points?
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.480]   Why aren't you sitting there collecting cash back?
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.900]   I really think there's two different pieces to this.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.920]   So the first piece is that they make travel possible in ways that
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.680]   cash doesn't always make practical.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.760]   I can almost guarantee that anybody who's not focusing right now on earning miles
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.000]   and points could be traveling more or more comfortably or both if they're
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.920]   learning to maximize miles and points.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.400]   The other big piece of it for me is that it's kind of a psychological thing.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.640]   I think we all like getting a deal.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.000]   And the thing with miles and points is that that discount is
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.600]   often significantly higher.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.880]   So, you know, we're looking at saving 60 or 70 or sometimes like,
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.680]   believe it or not, 90% or more.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.400]   That takes things that are just impossible and brings them within reach.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.080]   Miles and points create these opportunities for far outsized value.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.000]   And that's exciting and fun.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.320]   You know, when you get on a plane and you know that you paid 90% less than
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.840]   somebody else on that plane, there's an exciting element of that.
