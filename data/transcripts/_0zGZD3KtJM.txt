[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080]   [music]
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.920]   Welcome everyone to the 78th edition of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.680]   Today our special guest is Perilla Binder, a professor of economics at the University
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.320]   of Texas and an inflation historian.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.200]   Today we're going to be discussing the history of inflation in the United States and her
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.640]   new book "Shock Values, Prices and Inflation in American Democracy."
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:42.640]   [music]
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.600]   Hi everyone, my name is Rick Ferry and I am the host of Bogleheads on Investing.

[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.840]   All of the sessions were recorded and they're all available for free at the Bogle Center
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.840]   website.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.560]   Second, the 2025 conference will be in San Antonio, Texas the weekend of October 17th
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.120]   through the 19th.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.720]   It's in a wonderful location and it's going to be a fabulous conference.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.080]   I'll provide more information on future podcasts when it becomes available.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.960]   Our guest today is Carola Binder.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.680]   She is an associate professor of economics at the University of Texas.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.360]   She's a research associate for the National Bureau of Economics Research and she is also
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.120]   a fellow at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.360]   She has a PhD from the University of California at Berkeley and her focus is on inflation,
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.920]   inflation expectations, monetary policy, and economic history.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.800]   Carola Binder is the author of a new book and her first book on the history of inflation
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.680]   and price stability in the United States titled "Shock Values, Prices and Inflation in American
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.680]   Democracy."
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.120]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Carola Binder.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.320]   Welcome to the Bogleheads on Investing podcast, Carola.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.720]   Thanks a lot for having me.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.080]   I'm excited to be here.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.160]   I was really interested in reading your book after seeing a review on a topic that I wanted
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.480]   to understand more about, which is price stability.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.640]   Price stability is both inflation, deflation, disinflation, and all the things our government
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.900]   does to try to control prices.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.960]   Your book title is "Shock Values, Prices and Inflation in American Democracy."
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.800]   We'll get into the book in a few minutes, but before we do that, tell me a little bit
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.720]   about yourself, your background, why study economics, why concentrate on inflation.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.720]   Sure.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   I'd be happy to.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.440]   So I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, and then I went to Georgia Tech for undergrad
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.760]   where I studied math, but I got more interested in the public policy side.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.240]   And so I decided to do a PhD in economics at Berkeley during the slow recovery period
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.580]   from the Great Recession where monetary policy was very interesting.
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.440]   The Fed was experimenting with new kinds of tools.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.840]   I got interested at that point in studying inflation and studying inflation expectations
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   as well.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.600]   Also, while I was at Berkeley, I met my husband and we've since had five children, so I'm
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   a mom of five.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   Wow.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   You're a busy person.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   I am busy.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.480]   I started my career at Haverford College in Philadelphia.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.840]   I worked there for nine years, and just this summer I moved to the University of Texas
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.800]   at Austin, partly to help with the start of a new school there called the School of Civic
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   Leadership.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.320]   I'm building this whole new school, starting majors in civics honors and minors in civics
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.080]   and in politics, philosophy, and economics.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.360]   In my first semester here at UT, I actually taught a course about my book, so it was called
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.120]   Inflation in America, and in the spring I'll be teaching a new course on democracy and
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.120]   capitalism.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.840]   That's a little bit about me.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   That's great.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.000]   Your book, Shock Values, is to provide an account of how price fluctuations, inflation
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.240]   and deflation in government, attempts to manage these price fluctuations through things like
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.760]   paper money, price controls, tariffs, regulation, monetary policy, and other means.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.080]   Inflation is not a 21st century or a 20th century phenomenon.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.280]   It goes back hundreds of years and different ways of trying to control it, which we'll
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   get into.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   But before we get into the book, I do want to go over some of these terms, some of them
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.560]   which we already threw out to make sure that everybody's on the same page.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.880]   Let's start out with the basic one.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.520]   Give me your definition of inflation.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.160]   Inflation is growth in aggregate prices, so it's when prices in the economy are rising.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.980]   Not just relative prices, so it's not just egg prices are rising or gas prices are rising.
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.720]   You have to have some measure of the aggregate or overall price level, and inflation would
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.880]   be the rate of change in that price level.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.440]   Then there's deflation.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440]   So what is deflation?
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.120]   Well, it's just the opposite of inflation.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.680]   It's when aggregate prices are falling.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.360]   Is deflation bad?
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.440]   It can be, and often it has been.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.600]   It was very bad during the Great Depression when deflation is caused by too low of aggregate
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.600]   demand.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.800]   But it doesn't necessarily need to be bad.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.320]   For example, you could imagine that there's a major boost in productivity.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.080]   Everyone in the economy gets more productive.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.680]   We can produce more stuff.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.360]   That would tend to make prices fall.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.100]   It could be even deflationary, but we would all feel richer.
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.600]   The kinds of deflation that we've more often experienced are deflation like in the Great
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.400]   Depression when prices are falling because nobody has that demand to buy stuff.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.640]   So that kind of deflation tends to be bad, and that's what the Federal Reserve really
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.560]   wants to try to avoid.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.680]   Can wages deflate?
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.320]   Can Social Security deflate?
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.520]   Can people get less money in Social Security?
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:41.080]   Wages can fall, but employers know that people get really upset if their wages fall even
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.960]   if prices are falling, and that's actually one reason why deflation can be bad.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.720]   Think about when we had 8% inflation.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.840]   Some people still got 2% wage increases.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.520]   That's like the same as if they're being cut by 6% in real terms.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:03.000]   But people didn't get too mad about that versus if we had had 0% inflation and your wages
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.560]   got cut by 6%.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.640]   People would be more mad about that if they have some sort of nominal illusion.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.560]   And there's a name for that, correct?
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.200]   It's called the money illusion?
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.000]   Money illusion or nominal illusion.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.480]   Economists more often call it nominal illusion these days, but money illusion also.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.080]   And is this, do you think, one of the reasons why the Federal Reserve is targeting 2% inflation
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.080]   rather than 0%?
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.720]   Yes, that's definitely one of the reasons because they want to give that little bit
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:37.180]   of buffer so that we don't get stuck in a world where there's -1% inflation and employers
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.860]   need to cut wages, but they can't do it because of the money illusion, so they would have
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.800]   to resort instead maybe to laying people off.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   Interesting.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   Another term, disinflation.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.480]   Yeah, disinflation.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.160]   That means slowing down in the rate of inflation.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.840]   So it sounds like deflation, but it's a little different.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:02.680]   When inflation was at its peak of 9% or so, the Fed helped bring inflation down to 2 or
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.680]   3%.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.400]   We still have positive inflation.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:11.200]   Prices are still increasing, but they're increasing at a slower rate and that's called disinflation.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:17.040]   Is there a reciprocal to that when inflation is increasing at a faster rate than it was?
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.040]   That exists.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.080]   I don't think we have a name for it, just accelerating inflation or inflation is rising.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.320]   I don't know why we have a special term for when it's falling, but not when it's rising.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.160]   Let's talk about demand and supply.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.280]   This is one of the most basic economic theories having to do with pricing.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.280]   Sure.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.680]   It's actually a little bit hard to define demand without using the word demand in the
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:49.360]   definition, but demand or aggregate demand is what people want, all the goods and services
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.800]   that people want to buy.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.800]   And need to buy in some cases, like shelter, food, pharmaceuticals, things like this.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.360]   So it would be an aggregate demand includes consumption, investment, government spending,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.600]   and net exports, which is exports minus imports.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.360]   So basically the GDP equation.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   Yeah, it is the GDP equation, but what those all end up being depends on equilibrium with
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.440]   supply.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:22.680]   So demand is like at a given price, how much are people willing to buy?
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.280]   And then supply is how much would people be willing to produce at that price?
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.560]   But supply is more about the production side.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.120]   Supply shocks are things like oil shocks, where there's a change in oil prices and that
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.940]   makes it more expensive to produce things.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.600]   So at any given market price, producers would be supplying less.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.440]   And the name of your book is called Shock Value.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:52.720]   So we're specifically talking about supply shocks that can occur from weather disasters,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:10:00.080]   wars, and demand shocks, which are more, what do people want and what do they need and how
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.400]   much do they want and how much do they need at any given times?
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.720]   And I'm assuming that's where your shock value came from.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:12.040]   Yeah, it's a little bit of a play on words and my editor really wanted me to have a catchy
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.440]   title other than just my more technical subtitle.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.760]   But yeah, it's a play on supply shocks and demand shocks and then also values as kind
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.480]   of a synonym for prices.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:27.160]   And your theory in the book is that it's these shocks that occur that cause government to
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.160]   act.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.240]   Now, when there's a demand shock or there's a supply shock or both in the case of, say,
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.040]   the pandemic, it causes government to take action.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.320]   And what action are they taking?
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.120]   And that's a lot of what your book is about.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.240]   Although oftentimes the government itself is the source of the shock, this is not being
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.480]   political, it's just saying demand shocks, they often come because of monetary policy
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.860]   or because of fiscal policies.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:59.040]   Fiscal spending is a positive demand shock or a central bank increasing the money supply
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.880]   is a positive demand shock.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.040]   The government maybe tightening certain kinds of regulations could be a negative supply
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.040]   shock.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.800]   So a lot of the kind of downside of using the term shock is that it makes it sound like
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:17.000]   things just kind of randomly happen, but things do happen for reasons, and often the reason
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.480]   is policy.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.240]   I want to talk about the first price index.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:28.520]   It was created, according to your book, by an Italian named Count Gianvinaldo Carli.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.960]   Did I say that right?
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.880]   As far as I know.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.880]   Okay.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.120]   So this was created in 1750.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.320]   He was a mathematician and scientist and amongst other things.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:48.160]   And he wanted to kind of, I think, find out if it was true whether prices in Italy, which
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.800]   were going up at the time, were a result of something having to do with the price of gold
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:59.120]   or something having to do with what was going on with government debasement.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.920]   What does debasement mean?
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:06.840]   When you have gold or silver coins as money, debasement is shaving those coins down so
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.720]   there's less money for each unit.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.760]   So if we had coins and we called them gold dollars and each one was worth one dollar,
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:19.700]   but the government shaved them down so instead of being one ounce each, they were three quarters
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.320]   of an ounce each, that would be debasing the currency.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:28.280]   The coins that he was thinking about were denominated in Italian lira.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:33.320]   And what he found by estimating his price index, he was able to help show that prices
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:40.200]   were rising because the government was expanding the supply of lira denominated coins, but
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.920]   it wasn't actually expanding the supply of gold itself.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.200]   So this was increasing prices in terms of lira.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.840]   You know, I've read that and I said, this is the 1750s.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:55.260]   And even though that price index was created for him to investigate why prices of goods
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:01.760]   in Italy were rising, people knew that the government was doing this.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.360]   Sometimes the government tries to hide things, like different ways of debasing their currencies.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.400]   And people know this.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:14.580]   Maybe they have scales or maybe they knew that it wasn't 100% gold in the gold coin.
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:19.260]   Maybe it was only 90% gold and 10% lead or something.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:25.780]   But as people began to realize this, they began to not accept these coins or at least
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.940]   accept them at a lower value, thus inflation.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.180]   You can't get away with this stuff for very long.
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.440]   Yeah, you're right, expectations and beliefs play a big role in inflation.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.980]   So when people start to realize that these coins are worth less in terms of gold or in
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.840]   terms of silver, then they're going to say, well, I need more of them in order to exchange
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.380]   something with you, and that's why prices rise.
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.780]   Price indexes started in this country, when?
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.040]   When did we have our first price index here in the US?
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:05.700]   First official ones, at least, I think were in the 1880s or 1890s.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.560]   The Bureau of Labor was producing these kinds of indexes.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.580]   They got a group of researchers to go and collect data on thousands of different prices.
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:20.980]   They were able to collect price data back to about 1860 and construct these indexes.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:26.020]   There were more informally constructed price indexes even before that.
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:31.860]   I think even during the Civil War, there was some interest in knowing how the greenbacks
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.620]   were affecting prices.
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.940]   So people would construct price indexes of their own, maybe using a smaller number of
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:43.380]   prices in the basket, but 1890s was the first official one.
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:48.260]   From there, we have moved on to more modern indices.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.660]   What is the CPI?
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:57.760]   The CPI stands for the Consumer Price Index, and that is the most commonly used, most widely
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.220]   reported price index in the US today.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:08.900]   What the CPI tries to do is capture how prices are rising for a typical consumer, a typical
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.740]   urban consumer in the US.
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:16.580]   To construct the index, the Bureau of Labor Statistics needs to do some surveys to figure
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.820]   out what people actually spend their money on so that they're able to say, okay, maybe
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:31.180]   5% of spending is on gasoline and X% is on egg and on socks and things like that.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.940]   Then they also have to measure the prices of all these things.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.980]   They have a somewhat complicated formula, but they weight all the different price changes
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:45.580]   by their consumption weights so that they're able to say, okay, if you're a typical household
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:53.220]   in the US in a city, how much is the price of your whole consumption basket increasing?
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:59.100]   Why did they create a core CPI rather than just the standard CPI that includes everything?
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.060]   Yeah, that standard one we call the headline CPI.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:09.040]   The core strips out the prices of food and energy, which are the most volatile prices,
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.140]   so they tend to have big fluctuations both up and down.
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:18.900]   Constructing the core is helpful in seeing maybe a clearer signal of underlying trends.
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.260]   It just strips away a lot of the noise.
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:26.380]   That sense it's useful for policy makers like at the Federal Reserve who want to respond
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:32.460]   to where they think inflation is heading, not overreact to inflation that's increasing
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.700]   just because of energy prices.
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:41.520]   How does the CPI differ from the PCE, which is the Fed's personal consumption expenditure,
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.820]   which is the one we hear about in the background, not the headline?
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:51.700]   The PCE, personal consumption expenditures price index, that's the probably next most
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.740]   important one in the United States.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:59.020]   That's the one that the Federal Reserve targets when they say they have a 2% inflation target.
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:04.640]   They really mean they want PCE inflation to be around 2%.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:10.300]   It differs from the CPI because differences in the formula, some differences in the weights
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:15.580]   that different categories get, and even some difference in exactly whether you include
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:21.180]   just consumption by consumers for themselves or you also include things like employer-sponsored
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.380]   health insurance.
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:27.460]   There's different categories of spending that are included in the two indexes.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:33.940]   As a result, the PCE tends to be about half a percentage point lower than the CPI on average.
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:41.900]   When the Fed is targeting 2% PCE inflation, it's like they're targeting 2.5% CPI inflation.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.640]   I didn't know that about the half a percent difference.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.260]   That difference can change over time because the two indexes, for example, weight housing
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.540]   very differently.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:55.880]   If you have major change in house prices, you might get a bigger than usual gap between
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.260]   PCE and CPI.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.860]   It's not always half a percent, but that's what it tends to be around.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.700]   What is it that the government used to increase Social Security benefits?
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.700]   Which one of those two?
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.580]   They used CPI.
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:13.620]   Most of the government uses the CPI as their main inflation measure.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.980]   The Fed is a little unique in using the PCE.
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.700]   There's a lot of debate at the Fed when they first started inflation targeting about which
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.980]   measure they should use, and there was some argument for we should do the same as the
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:30.420]   rest of the US government is doing, but they ultimately felt that the PCE was a better
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.900]   measure of inflation and decided to go with that one.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:42.660]   If you want to cut the budget deficit by reducing increases in government wages and Social Security,
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:47.860]   that the federal government would go to the Fed's model, which is a half a percent less
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:48.860]   than the CPI.
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:49.860]   Yeah.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.740]   I don't actually get into this in the book, but in an article I recently wrote for Works
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:59.580]   in Progress magazine, it's about these different measures of inflation and some of the politics
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.020]   behind them.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:07.340]   There have been various commissions over the years to study the CPI and how it's measured,
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:13.340]   in part because there was concern that the CPI was overstating inflation and an eagerness
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:18.100]   to say, "Well, let's figure out why it's overstating inflation and get a more accurate measure,"
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.460]   and that's also going to have this benefit of reducing the government's budget deficit
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.420]   because our expenditures on things like Social Security will be lower.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:32.380]   You can probably guess what interest groups were opposed to those kinds of changes.
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.520]   Last one is the producer price index, PPI.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.300]   What is it and why is it important?
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.900]   The producer price index, it's similar to the consumer price index, but it's trying
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:47.020]   to measure the prices that producers are going to face rather than consumers.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.420]   It's more of a measure from a seller's perspective rather than a consumer's perspective.
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.500]   We're going to run into some more terms as we start going through your book, but I wanted
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:02.180]   to just get those basic ones out before we jump into shock values, prices and inflation
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.180]   in American democracy.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.980]   There's a soap act with stuff.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.100]   Each one of these chapters itself could be a book.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:14.700]   You went through the entire history of the United States, even prehistory when we were
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.500]   still under British rule.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.220]   Quite fascinating to read.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:23.820]   One thing you said, though, I understood it because I was in the military for, well, I
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.560]   actually did more than 21 years, total active duty and reserve time.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.380]   We have a saying in the military that the plans that you make are always fighting the
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.380]   last war.
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.900]   When we went into Desert Storm, we were wearing green camis in the desert.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.220]   We were planning for the jungle because that's what the Vietnam War was.
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.700]   Anyway, you said the same thing about fighting inflation.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:51.180]   You said the government's decisions on these brushes of price instability have not created
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:57.540]   a more perfect union, but one that reflects its most recent failures, in other words,
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.540]   fighting the last war.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.700]   I find that was an interesting quote.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.700]   Oh, thank you.
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.060]   And thank you for your service.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:09.140]   The clearest example I think I can give is the recent one, which is when the Fed adopted
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:14.500]   average inflation targeting just a couple of years ago during the pandemic.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:19.380]   For many years, the Fed had been struggling with inflation that was actually lower than
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.240]   their 2% target.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.860]   They felt that high inflation was a thing of the past, but they were really concerned
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.180]   that they couldn't keep inflation high enough.
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:33.940]   So they decided to change the way they did inflation targeting and say, "We're going
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.340]   to have it be asymmetric.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:42.940]   So if we undershoot our 2% target, we promise we'll make up for it by overshooting, but
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.220]   not vice versa."
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:49.940]   So this asymmetry was designed to help them boost inflation back up.
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:54.540]   When they were coming up with that, I don't think they had in mind something like we actually
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:59.060]   saw happen, which was inflation getting out of control again, inflation getting really
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.060]   high again.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.980]   And of course, that is what happened.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.420]   So they were fighting that last battle, fighting the battle of, you know, the 2010s was basically
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.580]   a battle of inflation is too low.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.940]   What can we do to boost it?
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:15.060]   They forgot about the other battle, which is when inflation gets too high.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.380]   Let's talk about the four themes that you have in the book, and then we're going to
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.460]   get into each of these chapters.
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:26.180]   The first one is price fluctuations affect different interest groups in different ways.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:32.660]   And classic in your book is what hurts the farmers helps manufacturing.
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.660]   Right.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:40.180]   So one of the big implications of inflation is what it does to debt, because debt tends
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.580]   to be in nominal terms.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:48.980]   The reason that deflation hurt farmers and inflation helped them is because they tended
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.980]   to be debtors.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.900]   They would take out nominal debts in order to buy their seeds and equipment to be able
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.660]   to grow their crops.
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.740]   When you have a nominal debt, if there's inflation, that erodes away some of the value
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:05.180]   of that debt and helps you out, and vice versa if there's deflation.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:10.100]   We don't have really a society of farmers anymore, but we still have some people who
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:15.340]   are debtors, some people who are creditors, and inflation is going to affect them differently.
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:20.980]   It also affects people in different ways because of the kinds of assets that they own and also
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.820]   because of different kinds of jobs.
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:28.380]   Your wages might be more or less likely to keep up with inflation.
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:34.360]   You might be more or less susceptible to losing your job if there's a monetary tightening.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.500]   People buy different stuff also.
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.540]   When there's inflation, not all prices are rising at the same rate.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.780]   So some people will feel it a lot more.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:49.100]   That's why inflation tends to cause a lot of political tensions because it's affecting
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.660]   different people in different ways, and they have different preferences about what the
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.420]   policy response should be.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.980]   We don't have the agrarian economy we used to have, but we do have a lot of homeowners,
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.660]   people who take out 30-year mortgages at sometimes very low interest rates.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.180]   And then we have renters, people who don't own a home, they rent.
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:10.060]   And of course, high inflation hurts renters, helps people who have a home because it causes
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.620]   the value of the home to go up, and they rent at a low interest rate.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.820]   So there are winners and losers.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:19.540]   And so it makes it tough when you're doing policy, whatever you do is going to hurt one
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.020]   group and help another.
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:27.540]   The second part of the theme was inflation has a different effect on debtors as it does
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.380]   on creditors, which we just talked about.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:37.140]   And the third theme that you have was something that I learned back in the 1990s when I was
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:41.980]   getting my master's in finance, and it was, and I'm going to say this wrong, but crisis
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.580]   and Leviathanian?
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:47.900]   I think it might be Leviathan, but I don't actually know either.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.900]   That's how it's spelled.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:55.300]   It was the title of a book in 1987 by Robert Higgs, and it was about how whenever there's
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:25:01.420]   a national emergency, the federal government gets more authority over economic decision
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.500]   making.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.620]   And then that doesn't totally go away when the crisis is over.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:11.100]   So it has this kind of ratchet effect that gives the government authority that's just
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.460]   widening over time.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:21.460]   There was a famous quote by Rahm Emanuel, a politician from Chicago, and President Obama's
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:29.140]   former chief of staff who famously said, "You never want a serious crisis to go to waste."
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.120]   And finally, the long road to inflation targeting.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.220]   This is the fourth theme.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:39.620]   This theme is about the power of ideas and the idea that we have now of having an independent
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:46.540]   central bank with some numerical target that is delegated responsibility for price stabilization,
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.100]   something that the U.S. only adopted fairly late.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:54.980]   We only officially got an inflation target in 2012, but it was an idea that was brewing
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.340]   for quite a long time.
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:05.040]   So a lot of the book tells the story, especially of some of the key people behind that idea.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.660]   So those are the four themes of the book.
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.260]   Price fluctuations affect different interest groups.
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.580]   Inflation has different effects on debtors and creditors.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.400]   The government has a more active role when there is a price shock, which never completely
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.820]   goes away.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.540]   And finally, trying to get it right, you know, through maybe inflation targeting of some
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:27.220]   sort and coming up with what is a better metric than maybe what we currently are using.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:31.140]   So now we can get into the book, the 14 chapters that you have, which I do want to start out
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.980]   with inflation during colonial times.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:39.420]   So here we are, not even a nation under British rule, what was going on and what are the major
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.420]   highlights?
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:46.260]   So one highlight there is the power of having control over monetary arrangements.
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.700]   That was something that the colonies at first didn't have.
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:57.580]   Great Britain had different policies to limit the colonists' ability to issue money or have
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.740]   any sort of paper currency.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.180]   Then it came time for the Revolutionary War.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:09.740]   You have wartime inflation because, you know, they finally just started printing more money.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.500]   And then the post-war deflation.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.820]   During that Revolutionary War inflation, there was some push for price controls.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:23.060]   Some were actually implemented, but only at very local levels because there wasn't really
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:29.340]   any federal authority to try to impose price controls at broad scale.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:33.300]   So they weren't very effective, but also there was just a lot of philosophical opposition
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.300]   to price controls because they were seen as illegitimate.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:41.820]   It was seen as like forcing people to sell stuff against their consent, which the founders
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.700]   were very uncomfortable with.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:48.580]   When there was deflation after the war, that led to Shays' Rebellion, which was basically
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:55.900]   a big uprising led by farmers and veterans who were so hurt by the deflation and left
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:01.860]   a big impression on the founders saying how bad these price fluctuations can be for social
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.500]   stability.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:09.740]   And that led to Washington appointing Jefferson, the first Secretary of State, and Hamilton,
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:14.700]   the first Treasury Secretary, and under Hamilton, Congress created the first bank of the United
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.180]   States to try to help control some of these fluctuations.
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:23.500]   This is about the years between the Constitutional Convention up until the election of President
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.500]   Jackson.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:29.980]   There were two different national banks that were started in those years, the first bank
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.140]   of the United States and the second bank of the United States.
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.880]   They're in some ways precursors to the Federal Reserve.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.780]   They did some of the things that the Fed later did, although they weren't exactly a central
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.780]   bank.
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:48.340]   But there was a lot of tension between Jefferson and Madison and those that were more supportive
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:55.140]   of farmers and thinking of the U.S. as a nation that should be an agrarian nation versus Hamilton
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:29:00.380]   and those that wanted to develop finance and manufacturing.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.660]   All the conflicts around these banks, why their charters eventually were not renewed.
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:11.960]   Leading ahead here to the War of 1812, here is where we saw our first national distribution
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.020]   of paper money, which became inflationary.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:22.020]   And then following the war, many changes took place that became known as the American system.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.060]   Yeah.
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:31.780]   So after the War of 1812, this American system, that's a name from Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky.
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.880]   The system included the Tariff Act of 1816.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:41.220]   The Tariff Act came because farmers actually fared pretty well after the war.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:45.060]   There was increased European demand for U.S. crops.
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:51.460]   There was a natural disaster, actually a volcanic eruption that led to crop failures in some
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:56.980]   parts of the world, which meant higher prices for the crops that American farmers were producing.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.980]   But the domestic manufacturers in the U.S. were not faring very well because they were
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.900]   getting these lower priced British manufactured goods.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.540]   So inexpensive imports were coming in from Europe.
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:15.080]   That was hurting the domestic manufacturers in the U.S. who were mostly in the north.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:20.340]   They went to Congress demanding a tariff as protection against these low prices that they
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.340]   were facing from abroad.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:26.420]   So that tariff was the first pillar of the American system.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.340]   During the War of 1812, there was no national bank.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:35.540]   The First Bank of the United States had lost its charter right before the war.
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.280]   So the second pillar was a new national bank.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:43.020]   Just to clarify, these banks, they were only given a charter for so many years, and then
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.020]   it ended.
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.020]   Right.
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.460]   They were given a 20-year charter, and at the end of the 20-year charter, it would go
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.180]   up for renewal.
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.820]   And in both cases, the banks didn't get their charter renewed.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.540]   Now, the Federal Reserve, when it was started, also was given a 20-year charter, but eventually
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:04.340]   before that charter was up, there was a vote to extend its charter into perpetuity.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:11.840]   And a third leg of this was this new second national bank would be a mechanism for expanding
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.740]   the country's infrastructure, roads, canals, and so forth.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.740]   Right.
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:23.120]   Fairly strong bank president came along for the second national bank, Nicholas Biddle,
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:29.360]   and he created a lot of policies and really pushed forward the idea of a federal or national
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.440]   bank and how it's going to work.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.320]   And that caused a lot of growth here in the United States.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.940]   Nicholas Biddle, when he was the leader of the second bank, he was trying to kind of
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:46.500]   help the U.S. have more of a uniform currency and regulate those state banks.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.500]   They were sort of hard to get under control.
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.820]   They had the tendency to overissue their bank notes.
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:58.380]   What's probably most famous about Biddle is his kind of antagonistic relationship with
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:04.180]   President Andrew Jackson, who Jackson really distrusted banks in general.
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:09.500]   He distrusted the second bank because he thought, you know, it gave too much power to a few
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:14.500]   private citizens and it didn't really have oversight from Congress or the president.
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.760]   So he was campaigning against the second bank.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.780]   He vetoed a bill that would have extended its charter.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:26.580]   He stopped depositing the government's funds in the bank and put them instead into like
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:31.520]   his, what were called his pet banks, state banks that he preferred.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:37.100]   And eventually the second bank also lost its charter just the way the first bank had.
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:45.300]   When the Civil War came along, the North and the South both issued their own paper currencies
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.180]   to finance the war.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:56.080]   The North financed the Civil War with greenbacks and the South financed their war with graybacks.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.220]   What was the difference between the greenbacks and the graybacks?
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:02.740]   Because the graybacks got inflated away very quickly and the greenbacks did not.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.740]   Yeah.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:09.060]   There are some interesting economic history papers trying to study the hyperinflation
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.900]   of the graybacks.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.780]   And again, part of the story is expectations.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:20.580]   So people have done really fascinating studies where they look at what happens to greenback
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:25.220]   prices and grayback prices when particular battles are won.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:31.000]   So when people get a better idea, uncertainty goes down a little bit about who's going to
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.360]   win the war.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:37.540]   That affects the prices because it depends on who wins the war, how much the greenbacks
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.380]   or the graybacks are going to be worth in the future.
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.480]   So I think once people started to realize that the South was going to lose and they
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:48.620]   knew that graybacks would be worthless, that means that there's like a hyperinflation in
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.640]   terms of grayback prices.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.200]   The Confederacy can't really get anyone to accept them.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.160]   They have to print more and more to try to buy anything with them.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.400]   Now, when the war was over, Grant became president.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.600]   He wanted to revert back to the gold standard.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.840]   But it was a group called the Grangers and they had a three-part proposal that focused
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.880]   on monetary policy, regulatory policy, and fiscal policy.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.800]   And when reading the book, it seemed like this was really an important part of our history,
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.800]   the Grangers.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.800]   This was a movement of farmers.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:26.240]   Remember what I said about farmers being hurt by deflation because of their debts?
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:31.080]   So during the Civil War, you know, as you can imagine with the greenbacks being issued
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.240]   with this like big paper money expansion, there was inflation.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:40.520]   Then, as you said, after the war, there was this desire to gradually return to gold.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.800]   So like contracting the greenbacks out of the money supply.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.280]   That led to deflation, which really, really hurt the farmers.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.900]   So there was this movement called the National Grange.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:56.600]   There was basically three different ways that they thought that we could counteract the
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.600]   deflation.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:02.760]   One would be with more expansionary monetary policy, which would either mean keeping the
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:07.320]   greenbacks or at least using silver and gold rather than just gold.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:12.480]   You could also have regulatory policies to help the farmer, like price controls on the
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.400]   railroads that farmers relied on to transport their crops.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.880]   And you could also have tariffs.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:26.040]   And this was also the era that the first independent regulatory authority, the ICC, was created.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.680]   What did the ICC do?
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:34.640]   ICC, the Interstate Commerce Commission, they were basically doing a form of price controls.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.840]   They required railroads to charge rates that were called reasonable and just.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:44.160]   So it was left a little vague, but basically railroads weren't allowed to charge higher
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.960]   rates on longer haul trips than shorter hauls.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:52.920]   It was supposed to help the farmers because they accused the railroads of price gouging
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:57.240]   them because they needed the railroads in order to be able to sell their crops.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:02.240]   But, you know, as you can imagine, it was pretty controversial.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.200]   And there was a lot of questions about, you know, even constitutional questions about
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:11.480]   whether these kinds of price controls were constitutional or not.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.960]   So we went through a period after the Civil War that was a lot of financial panics.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:22.280]   We had the financial panic of 1873, the financial panic of 1893, the financial panic of 1907.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:29.740]   And finally, the Aldrich-Verlin Act of 1908, which says, hey, we need to do something here.
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:33.560]   We need to create something that looks like Federal Reserve Bank.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.580]   And that led to the Jekyll Island Accord.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.240]   Talk a little bit about what happened at Jekyll Island.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.240]   Yes.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:45.560]   So Nelson Aldrich, that's what the Aldrich-Verlin Act, that's where the name Aldrich is from.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.040]   Nelson Aldrich led the National Monetary Commission.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:54.680]   It was prompted by the panic of 1907, which was such a major financial panic that there
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:37:01.360]   was recognition that we need some sort of institution to help deal with this.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:07.640]   And Nelson Aldrich led the commission in investigating monetary and banking systems of a lot of different
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.240]   European countries.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.900]   You can actually go read the reports of the commission today, they're all online.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:19.840]   They looked at how different countries in Europe had different sorts of central banks,
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:23.760]   more or less centralized central banks, and the role of their central banks in acting
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.360]   as a lender of last resort to the financial system.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.800]   They studied the discount system that was used by central banks in Germany and France
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:36.160]   and England and how those contributed to financial stability.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:42.260]   So then Aldrich came up with a plan for the U.S. based on those studies.
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:47.040]   The plan would have established a really centralized system.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.760]   He called it the National Reserve Association.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:56.640]   He met up with other bankers and people from the financial system in secret on Jekyll Island
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:02.360]   to discuss the plans for the system, but their plans aren't what eventually became the Federal
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.360]   Reserve Act.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:09.240]   So there's a lot of changes to the plan because, as you can imagine, Congress wasn't all happy
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:14.440]   with having this highly centralized system that seemed like it was designed by bankers
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.660]   to help bankers.
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:19.520]   So there was a lot of compromises and that's why we have the Federal Reserve System we
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:25.240]   have today, which is like a weird mix of centralized and not centralized with the different regional
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.960]   reserve banks, but also the Federal Reserve Board in D.C.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:35.000]   The first test of this central bank that ended up being formed was World War I and post World
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   War I.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:43.520]   During World War I, inflation rose substantially the year before by like 46% in this country
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.600]   between 1916 and 1917.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:54.600]   We entered the war in 1917 and then a lot of price fixing took place, which caused inflation
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:59.200]   to only rise by 17% from 1917 to 1918.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:04.160]   But everybody thought that, okay, the war's over and now prices are going to fall back
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.540]   and we're going to have a deflation and it's going to be very painful.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:15.600]   But what happened was the central bank, the Fed, sort of flooded the economy with money
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:21.880]   and we did not have a massive deflation that we had seen after other wars.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:26.000]   And so people came to realize that monetary policy may even work.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.520]   Well, first that really big 46% price increase that you mentioned from 1916 to 1917, that
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.200]   was really because of food prices.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:41.160]   So as fighting was happening in Europe, there wasn't much food production over there.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.840]   So there was such a strong demand for American crops and that's why you had prices rising
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.840]   so quickly.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:53.260]   And Woodrow Wilson was president and he really had this idea of government as administrators
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:59.080]   and he thought, we need technocrats here to help handle this problem and set up a system
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.760]   of price controls.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:06.960]   It wasn't a complete system of price control, so not all prices were controlled, but some
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.960]   were.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.440]   It was certainly more than was able to be done during the Revolutionary War because
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:17.800]   now we had a relatively strong federal government to be able to administer them.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:22.520]   The important thing to remember is when the Fed was created, that didn't do away with
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.520]   the gold standard.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.520]   The U.S. was still on the gold standard.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:29.880]   A lot of the rest of the world was too, but they mostly left the gold standard in order
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:37.240]   to fight the war and then were trying to return to the gold standard after the war.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:43.080]   But it was really hard for countries to return to the gold standard after they had inflated
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.000]   their currencies so much during the war.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.040]   So after World War I, there was kind of a new gold standard put into place called the
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:56.200]   gold exchange standard and it didn't work exactly like the pre-World War I gold standard
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.040]   and for many reasons didn't work as well.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:03.760]   During this period of time, interest rates were controlled not by the banks, correct?
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.520]   Actually it was the Treasury.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.600]   So the Fed, the discount rate was the interest rate that they would use as like their policy
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:16.960]   rate, but the Treasury required them to keep interest rates low in order to keep the Treasury's
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.840]   expenditures down.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.080]   And then afterwards, when they were allowed to finally raise rates because inflation did
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.200]   start coming back.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.680]   Yeah, they waited a while to raise rates after the war.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:33.440]   It's not like today where the Fed had inflation as its target, so they weren't like, "Oh,
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.520]   inflation is rising, so we need to raise rates."
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.920]   They were trying to maintain the gold standard.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:45.200]   So when interest rates are low, that's going to tend to make gold flow out of the country
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.840]   because investors are going to want to send their funds somewhere where they can get a
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.720]   higher rate of return.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:55.680]   When the U.S. was holding interest rates low because of that Treasury peg, eventually they
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.680]   were losing gold.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:02.840]   And that's why some people at the Fed wanted to raise rates, others didn't, and there was
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:07.440]   some tension between the Fed and the Treasury over when and whether they could raise rates.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:13.080]   So they wait a while to raise rates, and when they do, they increase them pretty quickly.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:20.240]   A major increase in the discount rate kicked off a recession of 1920 and 1921, which was
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:25.920]   very deflationary, so prices were falling, which had the same exact problems for the
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:31.200]   farmers as that post-Civil War deflation did.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:36.280]   Basically what happened that led to the Great Depression and falling prices, starting in
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.280]   1929?
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:43.280]   In some ways it was a parallel to the 1920-1921 recession.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.200]   The Fed raised discount rates.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:50.680]   It's hard to get into all the details in a short amount of time, but because the world
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:56.760]   was on the gold standard, but central banks were also concerned about domestic conditions
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:01.760]   and not strictly about the gold standard, there was a lot of trouble when the Fed raised
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.460]   interest rates.
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:10.360]   Countries were scrambling to try to maintain their gold, but also maintain domestic employment,
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:13.880]   and the whole system kind of got caught up.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.040]   Farm prices, especially in the U.S., were falling.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:20.800]   There was major deflation of all prices, but especially farm prices.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:26.000]   So farmers felt particularly hurt by the deflation.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.080]   And since it was worldwide, it meant our trade partners were in depression as well, which
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:35.000]   then meant that there were less people for us to sell to.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:43.560]   So prices were falling, and unemployment was very, very high, and central banks seemed
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:49.100]   at a loss for what to do, especially while they were trying to maintain the gold standard.
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:53.160]   So Roosevelt comes along in 1933 with the New Deal.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:59.120]   Roosevelt at first wants to reverse deflation and get back to zero inflation or no inflation.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.920]   He puts on price and wage controls, comes up with this idea of a living wage.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:10.320]   The stock market did bottom in 1932, but the recessions did continue through 1937.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:17.000]   A lot of that was blamed on labor, Fair Labor Act standards, first minimum wage, and so
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   forth.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.160]   When Roosevelt took office, he kind of said, "We need to somehow check this decline in
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:31.160]   prices, even if that means inflating the currency," and there was legislation passed that gave
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.940]   the executive more authority over monetary policy.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:40.320]   He eventually took the U.S. off the gold standard, which meant that then it was possible to do
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:47.220]   monetary expansion, that deflation was reversed, and a lot of the rest of the world also went
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.080]   off of the gold standard.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:54.480]   He also passed a lot of other New Deal policies that people might be familiar with.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:01.240]   There was a lot of court scrutiny over different policies that Roosevelt passed, particularly
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:08.080]   considering how they interfered with freedom of contracting, and the court had a turn of
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:13.920]   opinion that basically enabled the New Deal policies to be upheld.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:18.500]   Roosevelt's policies do get inflation down, but it's a very slow recovery.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:23.340]   World War II comes along, and we saw the same cycle that occurs in wars.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:30.220]   There were spikes in commodity prices, there were shortages, there was price controls,
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:35.180]   there was even an office of price control, wage controls, and so forth.
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:39.540]   And then when the war was over, a lot of the controls come off, and prices skyrocket.
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.780]   In fact, by 1947, inflation was 17%.
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.460]   Now we had too much inflation again.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:46.460]   Yes.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:52.500]   And Truman came back in with wage and price controls during the Korean War, if I'm correct,
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.260]   and got inflation down a little bit.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:56.260]   Yes.
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:03.500]   We get through the 1950s into the 1960s, John Kennedy becomes president.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:10.580]   He advocates for more government expansion into social programs, begins talking about
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:18.260]   a national healthcare system that was to eventually become Medicare and Medicaid under Johnson,
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:27.060]   and then Johnson labels it the Great Society, and creates another piece of landmark legislation.
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:32.660]   He also at the same time wanted to fund the Vietnam War, so lots of government expenses.
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:36.340]   Johnson wanted to keep interest rates low during this period of time in order for all
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:38.100]   this stuff to work.
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.300]   And you wrote in your book, "These were the seeds of inflation."
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.300]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:47.180]   He met with the Federal Reserve Chair, Chairman Martin, at the time.
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:53.980]   Martin was the Federal Reserve Chair for much of the 1950s and the 1960s, and I'd say in
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:47:00.420]   the 1950s he did a relatively good job keeping inflation fairly low and stable.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:06.020]   Johnson called Martin to a meeting at his ranch and tried to convince him that for easier
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:12.420]   monetary policy, Martin resisted that pressure from President Johnson, but at the same time
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:18.020]   that's when the Fed did start letting the money supply grow more quickly.
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:21.980]   Milton Friedman at the time warned that the money supply was expanding too rapidly and
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:28.180]   that it was going to be inflationary, eventually led to the Great Inflation of the 1970s.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.980]   Nixon comes in.
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.900]   Nixon had been a lawyer at the Office of Price Administration during World War II, so he
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.740]   was familiar with price controls, didn't really like price controls, but didn't like high
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.060]   inflation either.
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.060]   That's right.
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:48.380]   He did enact price controls in a three-phase program, but when he removed price controls
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:53.220]   in the third phase in 1973, it caused inflation to absolutely skyrocket.
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:57.820]   Yeah, he was really resistant to controls at first because of his experience during
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:58.820]   World War II.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:04.020]   He thought of price controls as requiring a lot of government snooping, these slide
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:08.740]   rule boys and snoopsters are kind of snooping around in your business because price controls
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:15.020]   does require a lot of government surveillance in all aspects of business, but the Fed Chairman
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:20.460]   Arthur Burns eventually convinced him that he needed to start, they called it incomes
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.340]   policy at the time, meaning price and wage controls because Chairman Burns didn't think
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.940]   that the Fed was actually capable of controlling inflation and thought that it had to be done
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:34.660]   by these kinds of controls, which in the first phase were pretty popular and seemed to be
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:39.380]   working, but it was sort of just holding back the floodgates, and as soon as they were loosened,
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:41.940]   all that inflation came right back.
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:47.420]   This caused the Arab oil embargo here in the United States, which caused more inflation
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:54.300]   and created what's called stagflation, where inflation is rising, but the economy is stagnant.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.300]   Right.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.300]   It was a tough period.
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.180]   I was a teenager during this period of time in college.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:00.180]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:05.220]   Stagflation is the combination of high inflation with high unemployment, so that's different
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.860]   than what we had in 2022.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:13.780]   We had high inflation, but at least the unemployment rate was low, so we were in that way much
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:18.420]   better off than the U.S. was during the stagflationary 1970s.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:23.180]   It was funny during this period of time that the Fed didn't believe that they could control
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.180]   this.
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:29.580]   When Ford comes in after Nixon and he starts his Whip Inflation Now program, I remember
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.580]   the wind buttons.
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.020]   It didn't really work.
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.020]   Right.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:38.620]   Took the Fed chairman, Paul Volcker's disinflation, to convince people that that monetary policy
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:41.020]   could control inflation.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:45.380]   Before that, Arthur Burns thought that, well, that the inflation was driven by supply shocks,
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:49.820]   that the Fed couldn't do anything about it, that it wouldn't be just too costly for anyone
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.980]   to bear, and the Volcker disinflation was costly.
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:57.940]   There was a big recession and unemployment, but eventually it took getting inflation down
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:03.540]   and building the Fed's credibility so that then unemployment could also come down.
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.140]   That all happened during the Reagan era.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:10.100]   Prior to that, Carter era, I remember Carter's malaise speech.
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:15.260]   He wasn't willing either to monetize inflation away by raising interest rates when Volcker
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.260]   came in.
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.220]   Volcker was Fed chairman, but he still couldn't enact what I think he wanted to enact, which
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:24.260]   was to let interest rates rise as high as they needed to.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.980]   Reagan did allow Volcker to do that.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:33.380]   He also went on this idea of union busting and knocking down union who was demanding
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.660]   higher and higher wages.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:41.420]   Very, very high interest rates in the early '80s did break the back of inflation finally.
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:46.580]   The Fed is vindicated in a way with Volcker showing that monetary policy is a way to control
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:51.260]   inflation and then bring in Greenspan.
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:52.580]   Greenspan kind of had it easy, I always thought.
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.500]   I mean, we had a good period of time.
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.500]   Inflation was falling.
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.620]   It was a pretty good period for the Fed.
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:04.660]   So under Greenspan, in some ways, the Fed was doing inflation targeting, but not explicitly.
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:10.180]   Greenspan really didn't want to say that the Fed had a 2% target or had a 3% target, but
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:15.380]   the Fed was able to keep prices relatively stable, largely because of Greenspan's own
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.380]   credibility.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.380]   A lot of people trusted him.
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:25.060]   It kept expectations relatively stable, and he was able to lead the Fed through the Great
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:31.300]   Moderation era, the time after that Great Inflation, but before the Great Recession.
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:35.860]   And even as other central banks around the world, it started in like the '90s to adopt
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:38.400]   inflation targeting, Greenspan didn't.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:43.180]   It was the successor, Ben Bernanke, who was really a big proponent of inflation targeting
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.900]   and eventually got the Fed to adopt it.
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:52.100]   Bernanke comes in, in 2006, and then the Great Recession happens, mortgage market falls apart
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:59.420]   due to what has been blamed as a lack of regulatory control over the writing of subprime mortgages.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:05.900]   That caused Bernanke to do some really unusual things to keep the country from entering a
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.480]   depression.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:12.420]   So we had a recession, but not a depression because of lots of things the Fed was now
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.420]   able to do.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:14.420]   He got more control.
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:21.180]   Yeah, Bernanke was a scholar of the Great Depression, and I think that his background
[00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:27.020]   in economic history really convinced him that the Fed could avoid the kind of Great Depression
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:32.840]   that had happened, and he was determined not to let the Great Recession be like the Great
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.840]   Depression.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:39.100]   He wanted to use unconventional monetary policy to keep major deflation from happening.
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:43.660]   So there was a tiny bit of deflation at the start of the Great Recession, but nothing
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.500]   like what we had in the Great Depression.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:53.940]   So things stabilize, and we get to the pandemic, and here, in my view, and again, it's just
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:53:01.700]   my opinion, it's almost overdoing everything to try to ensure that people had money coming
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:08.540]   in and interest rates going, in some places around the world, to negative by central banks.
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:09.540]   We didn't get there.
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.820]   I think there was one day T-bills actually went negative.
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:17.240]   Do you think it was an overdoing of fiscal policy and monetary policy, which then ended
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.500]   up causing the inflation that we've recently seen?
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:26.460]   Yeah, I think the Fed learned from the Great Recession, they responded too slowly and not
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:31.260]   strongly enough, and so there was this low aggregate demand that lasted for a really
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.260]   long time.
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:35.900]   The recovery from the Great Recession was so slow.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:37.900]   Inflation stayed below target for so long.
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:40.660]   We were at the zero lower bound for so long.
[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:45.060]   The unemployment rate took so long to return to normal that they wanted to err on the side
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:49.340]   of over-responding in 2020 and 2021.
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:54.860]   I mentioned they changed their monetary policy framework to average inflation targeting,
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:58.720]   which basically, the change in the framework, the way it was worded, gave them some leeway
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:03.780]   to wait a little longer to raise rates when inflation started rising than they probably
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:06.860]   would have under their previous framework.
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:11.780]   And on top of that, excessive fiscal stimulus in the form of not one check, not two checks,
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:12.900]   but three checks.
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:18.540]   This caused lots of money in the money supply, and at the same time, we had a decrease in
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:21.420]   demand because a lot of people were staying at home.
[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:26.580]   It was just all an explosion in potential inflation, which then got us to where we are
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:30.620]   today, which is the Fed had to significantly and quickly raise interest rates in order
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:32.220]   to rein in inflation.
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:37.200]   Yeah, initial decrease in demand from people staying home, that would tend to reduce inflation
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:42.940]   or even be deflationary, but there was also this reduction in supply when people aren't
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:48.300]   getting work done or when there's geopolitical shocks, etc., supply chain issues.
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:53.660]   What we had was a big increase in demand because of the combination of all the stimulus checks,
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:59.060]   which are positive aggregate demand shocks, and also the monetary policy was also boosting
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.060]   aggregate demand.
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:02.340]   So those are what were inflationary.
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:08.980]   So here we are today, 2025, and the Fed is lowering rates because inflation is getting
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.620]   closer to their target.
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:18.420]   You personally are not a big fan of using inflation only as the target for the Fed.
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:26.820]   You believe in nominal GDP as a better target than just inflation.
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:30.340]   So I'm going to give you the stage here for the last couple of minutes and just tell me
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:31.340]   why.
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:35.820]   Yeah, well, so the Fed, they do have an inflation target, but they don't have just an inflation
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:36.820]   target.
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:37.820]   They have a dual mandate.
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:42.560]   So they have to balance these two different goals, which is price stability, but also
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:45.780]   full employment, and those can come into tension.
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:49.860]   So sometimes to maintain price stability, we need to raise interest rates, but to maintain
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:54.540]   full employment, we need to cut them, and that then gives the Fed a lot of discretion
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:59.460]   because they could choose either one and they could justify cutting or raising.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:05.140]   It also makes investors and consumers more uncertain about what the Fed might do because
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:08.460]   they don't know exactly what kind of rule the Fed is following and they don't know how
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:12.740]   much they're going to prioritize either side of their dual mandate.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:17.900]   So the reason I like nominal GDP targeting is because it gives the Fed a single target
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:22.480]   that if they pursue it, it should allow them to fulfill both sides of the dual mandate.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.500]   The Fed can't choose to not have a dual mandate.
[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:28.020]   Congress gave them a dual mandate, but they could say, "Well, the way we're going to do
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:35.620]   it is by stabilizing the path of nominal GDP," because nominal GDP growth is just the sum
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:39.020]   of real GDP growth and inflation.
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:45.500]   So if you say, "Let's keep nominal GDP growing at 5% per year," for example, that would be
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:51.220]   consistent with real GDP growing at 3% a year and inflation at 2%.
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:56.820]   And sometimes the economy is hit by a supply shock and so we get higher inflation and lower
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:59.500]   real GDP growth or vice versa.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:05.180]   We sometimes get productivity shock and get higher real GDP growth and lower inflation.
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:09.940]   But either way, you just keep nominal income growing steadily.
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:14.960]   That actually helps a lot with the whole debtor versus creditor issue that we've talked about
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:19.180]   a couple of times because when people are thinking about taking out a nominal debt,
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:23.540]   what really matters is for their ability to pay it back is what is going to happen with
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.420]   their nominal income.
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:27.660]   And you think 5% is the number?
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:34.100]   I use that more for illustrative purposes, not that I know what the exact number should
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:35.100]   be.
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.700]   You would want to figure out what do you think is potential real GDP growth.
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:42.980]   If you think it's 3% and you think that 2% inflation sounds good, then you would add
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:46.500]   those up and get 5, but it could be a little lower or higher.
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:49.020]   I don't have a strong opinion about that.
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:51.260]   Are any countries doing this right now?
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:52.340]   No, they're not.
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:56.260]   So inflation targeting, I think partly it was just a path dependency thing where it
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:00.380]   was adopted first and it became the norm.
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.620]   I'm not a fan of inflation targeting.
[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:06.820]   I think inflation targeting is much better than most alternatives.
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:11.540]   But if you're going to make up for undershooting the target, then also make up for overshooting
[00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:12.540]   the target.
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:14.620]   Yeah, which isn't the case right now.
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:15.620]   Right.
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:19.900]   So they're a true average right now because they make up for undershooting the target,
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.580]   but not for overshooting the targets.
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:27.380]   It's a work in progress and maybe you could be one of the people on the forefront of what's
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:28.380]   going to happen next.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:29.380]   Oh, thank you.
