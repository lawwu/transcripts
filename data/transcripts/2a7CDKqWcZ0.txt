[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   The following is a conversation with Stephen Kotkin,
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.720]   his second time on the podcast.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.080]   Stephen is one of the greatest historians of all time,
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.320]   specializing in 20th and 21st century history
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.680]   of Russia and Eastern Europe.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.000]   And he has written what is widely considered
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.300]   to be the definitive biography of Stalin in three volumes,
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.280]   two of which have been published,
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.280]   and the third focused on World War II
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.680]   and the years after he is in the midst of writing now.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.680]   This conversation includes a response
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.600]   to my previous podcast episode with Oliver Stone
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.960]   that was focused on Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.960]   Stephen provides a hard hitting criticism of Putin
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.200]   and the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.560]   weighed and contextualized deeply
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.240]   in the complex geopolitics and history of our world,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.320]   all with an intensity and rigor,
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.320]   but also wit and humor that makes Stephen
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.540]   one of my favorite human beings.
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.380]   Please also allow me to mention something
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.220]   that has been apparent and has weighed heavy
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.880]   on my heart and mind.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.700]   This conversation with Stephen Kotkin
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.340]   makes it more dangerous for me to travel in Russia.
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.540]   The previous conversation with Oliver Stone
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.560]   makes it more dangerous for me to travel in Ukraine.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.420]   This makes me sad, but it is the way of the world.
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.560]   I will nevertheless travel to both Ukraine and Russia.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.620]   I need to once again see with my own eyes
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.780]   the land of my ancestors,
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.420]   where they suffered but flourished
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.580]   and eventually gave birth to, say, the old me.
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.340]   I need to hear directly the pain, anger, and hope
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.240]   from both Ukrainians and Russians.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.100]   I won't give details to my travel plans
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.260]   in terms of location and timing,
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.820]   but the trip is very soon.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.820]   Whatever happens, I'm truly grateful for every day I'm alive
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.420]   and I hope to spend each such day
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.260]   adding a bit of love to the world.
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.220]   I love you all.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.100]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.360]   and now, dear friends, here's Stephen Kotkin.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.220]   You are one of the great historians of our time,
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.620]   specializing in the man, the leader,
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.660]   the historical figure of Stalin.
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.820]   So let me ask a challenging question.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.700]   If you can perhaps think about the echo of 80 years
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.100]   between Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Putin,
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.060]   what are the similarities and differences
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.580]   between the man and the historical figure,
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.060]   the historical trajectory of Stalin and Putin?
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.500]   - Thank you, Lex.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.240]   It's very nice to be here again with you.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.300]   It's been a while.
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.140]   - Yeah. - Good to see you.
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.980]   - Yeah, good to see you as well.
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.260]   - You're looking good.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.860]   - You as well. - I see this podcast stuff
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.100]   is doing you right.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.380]   - Yeah.
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.900]   - So we can't really put very easily Vladimir Putin
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.160]   in the same sentence with Joseph Stalin.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.620]   Stalin is a singular figure
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.940]   and his category is really small.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.380]   Hitler, Mao, that's really about it.
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.700]   And even in that category, Stalin is the dominant figure,
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.620]   both by how long he was in power
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.700]   and also by the amount of power,
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.220]   the military industrial complex he helped build
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.060]   and commanded.
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.220]   So Putin can't be compared to that.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.420]   However, Putin's in the same building as Stalin.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.620]   He uses some of the same offices as Stalin used.
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.900]   And some of those, the television broadcasts
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.780]   that we see of Putin at meetings
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.060]   and Putin inside the Kremlin,
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.020]   Stalin used to sit in those rooms
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.860]   and hold meetings in those rooms.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.540]   That's the Imperial Senate built by Catherine the Great,
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.700]   an 18th century building inside the Kremlin.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.700]   It's a domed building and you can see it on the panorama,
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.460]   the top of the building,
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.200]   at least you can see it on the panorama
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.020]   when you look over the Kremlin wall
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.240]   from many sites inside Moscow.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.100]   So if he's not comparable to Stalin,
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.900]   he still works, as I said, in those same buildings,
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.780]   those same offices, partly.
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.780]   And so therefore, he's got some of the problems
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.300]   that Stalin had, which was managing Russian power
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.300]   in the world from a position of weakness vis-a-vis the West,
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.580]   but from an ambition, a grandiosity, in fact.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.340]   And so this combination of weakness and grandeur, right,
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.960]   of not being as strong as the West,
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.380]   but aspiring to be as great or greater than the West.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.260]   That's the dilemma of Russian history
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.220]   for the past many centuries.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.020]   It was the dilemma for the czars.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.700]   It was the dilemma for Peter the Great.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.140]   It was the dilemma for Alexander.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.460]   It was the dilemma for Stalin,
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.820]   and it's the dilemma for Putin.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.300]   Russia is smaller now compared to when Stalin
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.100]   was in that Kremlin.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.460]   It's got pushed back to borders
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.040]   almost the time of Peter the Great.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.220]   It's farther from the main European capitals now
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.200]   than any time since that 18th century.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.120]   And the West has only grown stronger
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.180]   in that period of time.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.680]   So the dilemma is greater than ever.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.980]   The irony of being in that position,
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.260]   of sitting in the Kremlin,
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.740]   trying to manage Russian power in the world,
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.740]   trying to be a providential power,
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.100]   a country with a special mission in the world,
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.420]   a country which imagines itself to be a whole civilization,
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.540]   and yet not having the capabilities
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.900]   to meet those aspirations,
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.220]   and falling farther and farther behind the West.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.500]   The irony of all of that is the attempted solutions
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.020]   put Russia in a worse place every single time.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.220]   So you try to manage the gap with the West.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.780]   You try to realize these aspirations.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.660]   You try to raise your capabilities,
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.400]   and you build a strong state.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.460]   The quest to build a strong state
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.420]   and use coercive modernization
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.420]   to try somehow, if not to close the gap with the West,
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.680]   at least to manage it.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.740]   And the result is different versions of personalist rule.
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.620]   So they don't build a strong state.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.540]   They build a personal dictatorship.
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.040]   They build an autocracy.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.420]   And moreover, that autocracy undertakes measures
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.420]   which then worsen the very geopolitical dilemma
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.020]   that gave rise to this personalist rule in the first place.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.420]   And so I call this Russia's perpetual geopolitics.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.380]   I've been writing about this for many, many years.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.860]   What's important about this analysis
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.860]   is this is not a story of eternal Russian
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.200]   cultural proclivity to aggression.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.820]   It's not something that's in the mother's milk.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.300]   It's not something that can't be changed.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.780]   Russia doesn't have an innate cultural tendency
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.880]   to aggression.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.020]   This is a choice.
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.660]   It's a strategic choice to try to match
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.540]   the power of the West,
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.600]   which from Russia's vantage point is actually unmatchable.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.040]   But it's a choice that's made again and again,
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.580]   and Putin has made this choice
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.960]   just as Stalin made the choice, right?
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.500]   Stalin presided over the World War II victory,
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.940]   and then he lost the peace.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.460]   After he died in 1953,
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.700]   there was of course other rulers who succeeded him.
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.460]   He was still the most important person in the country
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.140]   after he died,
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.180]   because they were trying to manage that system that he built
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.580]   and more importantly, manage that growing gap with the West.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.140]   By the time the '90s rolled around,
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.060]   former Soviet troops, now Russian troops,
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.740]   withdrew from all those advanced positions
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.520]   that they had achieved as a result
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.340]   of the World War II victory,
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.700]   and it was Napoleon in reverse.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.780]   They went on the same roads,
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.860]   but not from Moscow back to Paris,
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.460]   but instead from Warsaw and from East Berlin
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.220]   and from Tallinn and Riga
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.960]   and all the other places of former Warsaw Pact
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.520]   and former Soviet republics in the Baltic region.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.080]   They went back to Russia in retreat.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.020]   And so Stalin in the fullness of time lost the peace,
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:07.020]   and Putin in his own way, inheriting some of this,
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.180]   attempting to reverse it when, as I said,
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.160]   Russia was smaller, farther away, weaker,
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.380]   the West was bigger and stronger
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.820]   and had absorbed those former Warsaw Pact countries
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.180]   and Baltic states,
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.020]   because they voluntarily begged to join the West,
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.420]   the West didn't impose itself on them.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.500]   It's a voluntary sphere of influence that the West conducts.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.380]   And so that dilemma is where you can put Putin and Stalin
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.180]   in the same sentence,
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.500]   and the terrible outcome for Russia
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.740]   in the fullness of time also has echoes.
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.220]   But of course, Putin hasn't murdered
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.740]   18 to 20 million people,
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.940]   and the scale of his abilities to cause grief
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.020]   with the nuclear weapons aside is nothing like Stalin's.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.240]   And so we have to be careful, right?
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.300]   Only Mao put bigger numbers on the board
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.260]   from a tragic point of view than Stalin.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.140]   - And numbers matter here.
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.920]   If we compare these singular figures.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.780]   - Yeah, Mao killed more people than Stalin
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.500]   because Mao had more people to kill.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.180]   The most amazing thing about Mao is he watched Stalin do it.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.700]   He watched Stalin collectivize agriculture
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.780]   and famine result.
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.900]   He watched Stalin impose this communist monopoly,
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.900]   and all of those people sent to prison
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.340]   or given a bullet in the back of the neck,
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.420]   he watched all of that,
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.700]   and then he did it again himself in China.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.220]   - Do you think he saw the human cost directly?
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.300]   That when you say he saw,
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.180]   do you think he was focused on the policies,
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.580]   or was he also aware distinctly as a human being
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.060]   of the human costs in the lives of peasants,
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.940]   in the lives of the working class,
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.780]   in the lives of the poor?
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.820]   - I think the prima facie evidence
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.040]   is that he didn't value human life.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.380]   Otherwise, I don't think after seeing the amount of lives
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.020]   that were taken in the Soviet experiment,
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.340]   he would have done something similar after that.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.660]   I think the answer, Lex,
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.260]   is it's very hard to get inside Mao's head
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.120]   and figure out what he was really thinking.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.180]   But if you just look at the results that happened,
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.140]   the policies that were undertaken
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.240]   and the consequences of them,
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.060]   you would have to conclude that there was,
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.660]   let's say, no value or little value placed on human life.
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.860]   Unfortunately, that's characteristic
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.020]   not only of communist dictators,
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.620]   of post-communist dictators as well,
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.280]   but the scale of the horrors that they inflict,
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.600]   as horrific as they are, just can't compare.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.560]   And so we're in a situation where Eurasia,
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.040]   that is to say the ancient civilizations of Eurasia,
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.260]   which would be Russia, Iran, China,
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:13.400]   all have some version of non-democratic,
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.280]   illiberal, autocratic regimes,
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.160]   and they're all pushing up against
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.140]   the greater power of the West in some form.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.260]   Sometimes they coordinate their actions
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.340]   and sometimes they don't.
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.700]   But this is a very longstanding phenomenon, Lex,
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:33.460]   that predates Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping,
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.580]   or the latest incarnation of the supreme leader in Iran.
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.780]   - So we'll talk about this, I think,
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.580]   really powerful framework of five dimensions
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.140]   of authoritarian regimes that you've put together.
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.800]   But first, let's go to this Napoleon
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.800]   in reverse retreat from Warsaw, back.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.900]   Putin has called, from the perspective of Putin,
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.680]   this retreat, this collapse of Stalin
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.600]   is one of the great tragedies of that region of Russia.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.540]   Do you think there's a sense where,
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.740]   as Putin sits now in power for 22 plus years,
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:22.420]   he really dreams of a return to the power,
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:30.220]   the influence, the land of Stalin?
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.020]   So while you said that they're not in the same place
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.980]   in terms of the numbers of people
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.900]   that suffer due to their regime,
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.540]   do you think he hopes to have the same power,
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.860]   the same influence for a nation that was in the '30s
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.860]   and the '40s and the '50s of the 20th century under Stalin?
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.440]   - If he does, Lex, he's deluding himself.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.680]   We don't know for sure.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.380]   Very few people talk to him.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.580]   Very few people have access to him.
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.740]   A handful of Western leaders have met with him
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.240]   for short periods of time.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.700]   Those inside Russia barely meet with him.
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.540]   His own minions in the regime
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.220]   barely have face time with him.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.500]   We don't know exactly what he thinks.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.500]   It could be that he has delusions
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.420]   of reconquering Russian influence, if not direct control,
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.760]   over the territories that broke away,
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.920]   but it's not gonna happen.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.660]   Let's talk a little bit about this guy, Nikolai Potoshev.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.740]   Nikolai Potroshev is probably not well known
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.500]   to your listeners.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.900]   He's the head of Russia's Security Council,
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.860]   and so you could probably call him the second most important
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.220]   or second most powerful man in Russia,
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.020]   certainly inside the regime.
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.540]   Arguably, Navalny is the second most important person
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.020]   in the country, and we'll talk about that later, I'm sure.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.260]   - In terms of influence, yes.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.020]   - Yes, but Potroshev is a version
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.540]   of Putin's right hand man.
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:22.420]   And Potroshev has been giving interviews in the press.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.820]   You probably saw the interview with Nizavisimaya Gazeta
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.700]   not that long ago.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.620]   He writes also his own blog-like interventions
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:36.620]   in the public sphere using the few channels that are left.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.460]   And what's interesting about Potroshev,
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.860]   and this could well reflect similar thinking to Putin's,
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.560]   which is why I'm bringing this up,
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:53.140]   is that he's got this conspiratorial theory
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:57.940]   that the West has been on a forever campaign
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:02.300]   to destroy Russia, just like it destroyed the Soviet Union,
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.900]   and that everything the West does
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.420]   is meant to dismember Russia,
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.100]   and that Russia is fighting an existential battle
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.020]   against the West.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.580]   And so, for example, the CIA and the American government
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.020]   wanted to bring down the Soviet Union,
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.100]   never mind that the Bush administration,
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.500]   the first Bush, the father, was trying desperately
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.540]   to hold the Soviet Union together
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.580]   because they were afraid of the chaos that might ensue
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.540]   and the nukes that might get loose
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.540]   as a result of a Soviet collapse.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.580]   And it wasn't until the very last moment
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.800]   where Bush decided, his administration decided
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.780]   to back those Republican leaders
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.460]   who were breaking away from Mikhail Gorbachev
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.820]   and the Soviet Union, right?
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.340]   So never mind the empirics of it.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.060]   Never mind that Bill Clinton's administration,
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.780]   following George Bush, sent boatloads of money
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.660]   Western taxpayer money to Russia.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.740]   We don't know exactly how much
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.600]   because it came from different sources.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.260]   People talk about how there was no Marshall Plan.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.620]   It was tens of billions of dollars from various sources,
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.300]   from the IMF and other sources.
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.020]   And like I said, it disappeared.
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:22.840]   It's gone.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.100]   Just like the German money that went to Gorbachev
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.980]   for unification disappeared even before the Soviet collapse.
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.200]   The money disappeared, but the West sent the money.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.960]   So how is that a plot?
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.220]   And then you could go all the way, Obama's administration,
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.860]   George Bush trying to do business deals
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.780]   and reset the relations,
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.740]   and Obama administration trying to reset the relations
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.060]   and doing nothing after the Georgian war
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.980]   and slapping Putin on the wrist
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.100]   following the seizure, forcible.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.740]   And you could go on and you could go on
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.080]   all the way through the Trump administration
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.900]   telling Putin that he's right.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.100]   Trump believes Putin and doesn't believe US intelligence
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.020]   about Russian efforts to interfere
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.820]   in American domestic politics.
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.760]   So despite all the empirics of it,
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.780]   you have Poturchev and likely Putin
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:19.460]   talking about this multi-decade Western conspiracy
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.540]   to bring Russia down.
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.600]   At the same time as that's happening,
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.060]   the Germans are voluntarily increasing
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.020]   their dependence on Russian energy,
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.020]   voluntarily increasing their dependence on Russia.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.020]   So here's the conspiracy to bring Russia down.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.940]   The French, who fantasize about themselves
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.180]   as a diplomatic superpower,
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.700]   are constantly, the French leaders are constantly
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.220]   running to the Kremlin to ask what Russia needs,
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.700]   what concessions from the West Russia needs
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.740]   to feel respected again.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:58.700]   The British provide all manner of money laundering
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.540]   and reputation laundering services
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.540]   for the whole Russian oligarchy,
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.780]   including the state officials,
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.180]   who are looting the state and using the West,
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.980]   British institutions, to launder their money.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.740]   So all of this is happening and yet Potruchev imagines
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.220]   this conspiracy to bring Russia down by the West.
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.060]   And so that's what we've got in the Kremlin again.
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:26.900]   Stalin had that same conspiratorial mentality of the West.
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.520]   Everything that happened in the world
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.540]   was part of a Western conspiracy
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.340]   directed against the Soviet Union
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.140]   and now directed against Russia.
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.720]   Even though the West is trying to appease,
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.620]   the West is offering its services,
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.240]   the West is trying to change Russia through investment
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.660]   in a positive way, but instead the West is what's changing.
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.480]   The West is becoming more corrupt.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.540]   Western services are being corrupted
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.860]   by the relationship with Russia.
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.900]   So you have to ask yourself,
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.140]   who are these people in power in the Kremlin
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.300]   who imagine that while they're availing themselves
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:07.020]   of every service and every blandishment of the West,
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.220]   while they're availing themselves of this,
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.620]   that they're fighting a conspiracy by the West
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.440]   to bring them down.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.440]   So this is what they call the Abyssinia, right?
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.580]   In Russian, which is a term, as you know,
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.920]   that means those who are resentful
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.200]   or you might call them the losers,
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.060]   the losers in the transition.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.440]   So when the Soviet Union fell
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.760]   and there was a diminishment,
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.720]   a very substantial diminution in Russian power
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.060]   and influence in the world, a lot of people lost out.
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.980]   They weren't able to steal the property.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.580]   They weren't able to loot the state in the '90s.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.820]   And they were on the outside.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.300]   They gradually came back in.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.380]   They were the losers in the transition domestically.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:04.260]   And for them, right, they wanted to reverse
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.020]   being on the losing side.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:10.140]   And so they began to expropriate, to steal the money,
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.940]   steal the property from those first thieves
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.980]   who stole in the '90s.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.140]   And the 2000s and on have been about re-stealing,
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.220]   taking the losers in the transition,
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.940]   taking the money from the winners
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:30.660]   and reversing this resentment, this loser status.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.680]   Those are your Patrushevs and your Putins.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.460]   But at the same time, this blows out to,
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.760]   let's reverse the losses, being on the losing side,
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.680]   the roiling resentment at the decline
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.040]   of their power internationally.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.640]   Let's try to reverse that too.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:54.640]   So you have a profound psychological whole generation
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.380]   of people who are on the losing end domestically
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.500]   and reverse that domestically.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.300]   That's what the Putin regime is about.
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.200]   Remember Mikhail Khodorkovsky's Yukos.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.320]   Remember all the companies that are now owned
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.680]   by Putin cronies because they were taken away
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.760]   from whoever stole them in the first place.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.220]   And now they're trying to do that
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.200]   on the international scale.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.900]   It's one thing to put domestic opponents in jail.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.060]   It's one thing to take away someone's property domestically.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.060]   But you're not gonna reverse the power of the West
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.200]   with the diminished Russia that you have.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.960]   And so that project, that Patrushev project,
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.200]   which we see him expressing again and again,
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.920]   he speaks about it publicly.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.920]   It's not something that we need to go looking for a quest,
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.500]   the secret, we can't find it, what are they thinking?
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.780]   It's right there in front of our face.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.640]   And Putin has spoken the same way for a long time.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.800]   People point to the 2007 speech
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.600]   at the Munich Security Conference that Putin delivered,
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.680]   and certainly your listeners could use a snippet
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.000]   or two of that, just like they could use a couple of quotes
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.980]   from Patrushev to contextualize what we're talking about.
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.800]   But it predates the 2007 Munich speech,
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.480]   the reaction to Ukraine's uprising in 2004,
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:28.640]   attempt to steal the election inside Ukraine,
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.400]   which the Ukrainian people rose up valiantly against
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.000]   and risked their lives and overturned.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.480]   So there were public statements from Putin already back then,
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.360]   the statements about Khodorkovsky in 2003
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.080]   when he was arrested and expropriated.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   This is a longstanding, deeply psychological issue,
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.840]   which is about managing Russian power in the world,
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.000]   as I was saying, the gap with the West,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.200]   but has this further dimension of feeling like losers
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.080]   and wanting to reverse that.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.600]   That's their life experience.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.620]   - A vision there.
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:09.620]   So there's that resentment that fuels this narrative,
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:14.540]   fuels this geopolitics and internal policy.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.880]   But so resentment is behind some of the worst things
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.280]   that have ever been done in human history.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.600]   Hitler was probably fueled by resentment.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.040]   So resentment is a really powerful force, yes.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.320]   Just to maybe not push back,
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.320]   but to give fuller context on the West.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:38.320]   You said there's a narrative from Putin's Russia
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.240]   that the West is somehow an enemy.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.360]   You position everything against the West.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.920]   But is there a degree, and to what degree
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.880]   is the West willing to feed that narrative?
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.000]   That it's also convenient for the West to have an enemy.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.780]   It seems like in the place, in the span,
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.600]   it seems like in geopolitics,
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.600]   having an enemy is useful for forming a narrative.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.880]   Now, having an enemy for the basic respect of humanity
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.000]   is not good, but in terms of maintaining power,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.600]   if you're a leader in a game of geopolitics,
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.620]   it seems to be good to have an enemy.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.760]   It seems to be good to have something like a Cold War,
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.520]   where you can always point your finger and it says,
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.280]   all our actions are fighting this evil,
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.600]   whatever that evil is.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.280]   It could be like with George W. Bush, the war on terror.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.680]   Terrorism is this evil.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.440]   You can always point at something.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.120]   So you've made it seem that the West is trying.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.800]   There's a lot of forces within the West
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.700]   that are trying to reach out a friendly hand,
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.640]   trying to help, sending money, sending compassion,
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.060]   trying to sort of--
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.160]   - Trying to integrate Russia into global institutions.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.000]   - Exactly.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.220]   - Which was a longstanding, multi-decade effort
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.520]   across multiple countries and multiple administrations
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.720]   in those countries.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.160]   - But is there also warmongers in the West?
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.040]   - Of course, Lex.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.480]   Of course you're right about that.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.160]   But let's put it this way.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.000]   People talk about the Cold War,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.880]   and they're usually looking to assign blame
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.220]   for the Cold War, as if it's some kind of mistake,
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.920]   a misunderstanding, or a search for an enemy
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.280]   that was convenient to rally domestic politics.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:28.120]   So Lex, there's a coup in Czechoslovakia,
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.880]   and somebody installs a communist regime in February 1948.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.880]   No reaction to that?
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.680]   That's just okay?
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.120]   There's a blockade of Berlin.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.720]   Is that cool by you?
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.400]   Where they try to strangle West Berlin
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.560]   so that they can swallow West Berlin
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.120]   and add it to East Berlin.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.140]   You cool with that?
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:54.760]   How about Korean War, invasion of North Korea,
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.160]   invasion of South Korea by North Korea?
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.160]   You cool with that?
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.720]   How about the murders and the show trials
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.260]   up and down Eastern Europe in the late '40s,
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.120]   after the imposition of the clone regimes?
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.820]   You good with that?
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.360]   Yeah, it's very convenient to have an enemy.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.760]   I agree with you.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.160]   But there was some actions, Lex.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.880]   There was some threats to people's freedom.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.880]   There was some invasions.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.960]   There was some aggression and violence on a mass scale,
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.640]   like collectivization of Eastern Europe.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.680]   We could go on, Lex, with the examples.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.160]   I'm just giving a few of them.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.100]   And so the Cold War was not a mistake.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.520]   It was not a misunderstanding.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.360]   We don't have to blame someone for the Cold War.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.080]   We have to give credit for the Cold War.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.640]   The Truman administration deserves credit
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.640]   for standing up to Stalin's regime,
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.440]   for standing up to these actions,
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.040]   for saying, yeah, we're not just gonna take this.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.080]   We're not gonna let this go on.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.700]   We're not gonna let this expand to further territories.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.160]   We're gonna create the NATO alliance.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.800]   And we're gonna rally democratic, liberal regimes
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.200]   to stand up to this illiberalism,
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.440]   this violence, and this aggression.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:19.200]   And so, yeah, Lex, it's always convenient to have an enemy.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.700]   But there was an enemy.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.200]   Nikolai Leonov, who recently died,
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.880]   he died in April, 2022, and he had a major funeral.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   He was the last head analyst of the Soviet KGB.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:39.320]   And Leonov is one of the most important figures
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.800]   for understanding the Soviet collapse.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.180]   And he has the best memoir on the Soviet collapse,
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.100]   which is known in Russian as Likha Letya.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.000]   You will understand that.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   And you'll help your podcast listeners understand.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.200]   There's a singularity to that kind of expression,
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.840]   Likha Letya.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.320]   Leonov just died.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.980]   But one of the things, and in fact,
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:09.600]   the people who were supposedly arrested by Putin
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.160]   as scapegoats for the Ukraine war,
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.920]   the main one, Sergei Beseda,
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.680]   gave the eulogy at Leonov's funeral in April, 2022,
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.200]   showing that it's a lie,
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.800]   that all of these people have been arrested and purged
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.560]   and other nonsense in social media.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.560]   But to get back to what Leonov said
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.420]   and get back to your enemy point,
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.760]   Leonov said, you know, the West spent all this time
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.080]   blackening the image of the Soviet Union.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:44.000]   All these resources and propaganda and covert operations
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.840]   to blacken the Soviet image.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.200]   And they did, Lex, the West did do that.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.640]   And then Leonov wrote in the next sentence,
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.680]   and you know what?
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.720]   We gave them a lot of material to work with
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.240]   to blacken our image.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:02.240]   - Yeah, so you're saying a kind of sobering reality,
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.160]   which it is possible to some degree to draw a line
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.600]   between the good guys and the bad guys.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.040]   - Freedom is better than unfreedom, Lex.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.840]   It's a lot better than unfreedom.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.680]   And a guy like you understands that really well.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.780]   - Well, so yes.
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:18.960]   But those are all, you know,
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.340]   there's words like justice, freedom.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:26.240]   What else?
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:31.240]   Love, you can use a lot of words that Hitler himself used
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:36.280]   to describe why he is actually creating a better world
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.880]   than those he's fighting.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.320]   So some of it is propaganda.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   The question is on the ground,
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.440]   what is actually increasing the amount of freedom
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.280]   in the world?
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.920]   - Institutions, Lex, right?
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.540]   We're not talking about propaganda here.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.860]   When we use words like freedom,
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.380]   we're talking about rule of law.
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.940]   We're talking about protection of civil liberties.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.020]   We're talking about protection of private property.
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.260]   We're talking about an independent
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.500]   and well-funded judiciary.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.260]   We're talking about an impartial, non-corrupt,
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.400]   competent civil service.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.620]   We're talking about separation of powers
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.700]   where the executive branch's power is limited,
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.260]   usually by an elected parliament.
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.920]   In fact, yes, let's talk about elections.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.000]   Let's talk about freedom of speech
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.280]   and freedom of the public sphere.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.060]   We're not talking about freedom as a slogan here.
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.720]   We're talking about a huge array of institutions
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.340]   and practices and norms, ultimately, right?
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.200]   And if they exist, you know and you live under them.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.440]   And if they don't exist,
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.420]   you fully understand that as well, right?
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:48.420]   Ukraine was a flawed democracy before Russia invaded.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:55.260]   It's utterly corrupt, many ways dysfunctional,
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.540]   especially the elites were dysfunctional.
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:02.540]   The gas industry in Ukraine was absolutely terrible
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.640]   because of the corruption that it generated,
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.680]   the oligarch problem,
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.260]   a handful of people stealing the state resources.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.980]   And yet Ukraine had an open public sphere
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.620]   and it had a parliament that functioned.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:21.620]   And so despite its flaws, it was still a democracy.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:26.600]   The regime in Moscow, you can't say that, Lex.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.540]   It's not a comparable regime to Ukraine.
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.960]   You could say, oh, well, there were oligarchs in Ukraine
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.540]   and there were oligarchs in Russia.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.240]   There's corruption in Ukraine, there's corruption in Russia.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.300]   So really, what's the big difference?
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:43.020]   And the answer is, well, Ukraine had the open public sphere.
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.340]   Ukraine had a real parliament.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:47.700]   Can you call Russia's Duma a real parliament?
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.400]   I don't think so.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.940]   I don't think you can.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.100]   Can you say that there were any checks whatsoever
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.320]   on the executive branch in Russia?
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.380]   Can you say that the Russian judiciary had any independence
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:05.820]   or really full level of competence,
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.380]   even compared to the Ukrainian judiciary,
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.060]   which was nothing to brag about?
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.020]   No, you can't say that, Lex.
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.860]   So we can differentiate between the very flawed,
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:21.860]   corrupt, oligarchic democracy in Ukraine
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.340]   and the very corrupt, oligarchic autocracy in Russia.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.140]   I think that's a fair distinction.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.200]   - Yeah, we should say that Russia and Ukraine
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.200]   have the great honor of being the number one
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.020]   and the number two most corrupt nations in Europe
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.620]   by many measures.
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.220]   But there is a fundamental difference,
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.980]   as you were highlighting.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.620]   Russia is a corrupt autocracy.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:48.000]   Ukraine, we can say, is a corrupt democracy.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.420]   And to that level, there's a fundamental difference.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:57.700]   - Ukraine is not murdering its own journalists
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.700]   in systematic fashion.
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:03.380]   If journalists are killed in Ukraine, it's a tragedy.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.180]   If journalists are killed in Russia
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.140]   or Russian journalists are killed abroad,
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.620]   it's regime policy.
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.500]   - And the degree to which a nation is authoritarian
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:15.860]   means that it's suffocating its own spirit,
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:19.180]   its capacity to flourish.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.700]   We're not just talking about
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:26.780]   sort of the freedom of the press, those kinds of things,
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.780]   but basically all industries get suffocated
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.260]   and you're no longer being able to,
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:36.060]   yeah, flourish as a nation, grow the production,
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.260]   the GDP, the scientists, the art, the culture,
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.180]   all those kinds of things.
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.780]   - Yes, Lex, you're absolutely right.
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:45.020]   And so before the invasion, the full-blown invasion
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.220]   of February 2022 into Ukraine, because as you know,
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:52.060]   the war has been going on for many years at a lower level
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.260]   compared to what it is these days,
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.340]   but still a tragic war with many deaths
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.340]   prior to February 2022.
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.140]   Before this latest war, we could have said
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.740]   that the greatest victims of the Putin regime
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.900]   are Russian, domestic,
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.420]   that the people who are suffering the most
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:15.980]   from the Putin regime are not sitting here in New York City,
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.820]   but in fact, are sitting there in Russia.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.580]   Now, of course, with the invasion of Ukraine
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:26.580]   and really the atrocities that have been well-documented
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:30.420]   and more are being investigated,
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.980]   we can't easily say anymore that Russians
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.300]   are the greatest victims of the Putin regime.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:43.140]   But in ways other than bombing and murdering civilians,
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.820]   children, mothers, grandmothers, grandfathers,
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:52.460]   after you include that, then of course,
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.300]   the larger number of victims of the Putin regime
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:58.020]   are not Ukrainians, but ultimately Russians.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.700]   And there's how many of them now that have fled?
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:06.700]   - So your powerful, precise, rigorous words
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:11.780]   are then in a stark contrast, I would say,
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.100]   to my very recent conversation with Oliver Stone.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.460]   Now, I would love you to elaborate
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.740]   to this agreement you have here with his words
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:25.420]   and maybe words of people like John Mearsheimer.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.540]   The idea is that Putin's hand in this invasion of 2022
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:34.100]   was forced by the expansion of NATO,
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:38.340]   the imperialist imperative of the United States
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.800]   and the NATO forces.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:48.420]   You disagree with this point in terms of placing the blame
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:53.100]   somehow on the invasion on forces larger
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.340]   than the particular two nations involved,
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.580]   but more on the geopolitics of the world
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.140]   that's driven by the most powerful military nation
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.300]   in the world, which is the United States.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:09.300]   - Yeah, Lex, so let's imagine that a tragedy's happened
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.400]   here in New York and a woman got raped.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.920]   We know the perpetrator.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:19.340]   They go to trial and Oliver Stone gets up and says,
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.700]   "You know what?
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.060]   "The woman was wearing a short skirt
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:28.700]   "and there was no option but for the rapist to rape her.
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.900]   "The woman was wearing lipstick
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:35.080]   "or the woman was applying for NATO membership
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.700]   "and just had to be raped."
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:42.500]   I mean, didn't wanna rape her, but was compelled
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.580]   because of what she was doing and what she looked like
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.940]   and the clothes she was wearing and the alliances
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.620]   that she was under international law,
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.980]   signed by Moscow, all the treaties
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:57.180]   that sovereign countries get to choose
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.340]   whatever alliance they belong to,
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:04.820]   treaties that the UN Charter signed by Russia,
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:09.820]   Soviet Union, the 1975 Helsinki Agreement
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.300]   signed by the Soviet Union,
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.340]   the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.700]   signed by the Soviet Union,
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.300]   the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.500]   signed by the Russian government, the post-Soviet Russia,
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:29.500]   all of those documents signed by either the Soviet regime
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.620]   or the Russian regime,
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:36.260]   which is the legally recognized international inheritor,
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.460]   successor of the Soviet state,
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.460]   all of those agreements are still in force
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.900]   and all of them say that countries are sovereign
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.340]   and can freely choose their foreign policy
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.860]   and what alliances they wanna join.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.660]   Let's even go farther than that.
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.340]   I mean, you don't have to go farther than that,
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:58.020]   but let's go farther than that, Lex.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.020]   Is an autocratic repressive regime
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:04.820]   that invades its neighbors in the name of its own security
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.040]   something new in Russian history?
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.620]   Did we not see this before?
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:13.580]   Does this not predate NATO expansion?
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:17.180]   Does this not predate the existence of NATO?
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.380]   Would Oliver Stone sit here in this chair
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:23.620]   and say to you, you know, they had to impose serfdom
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:27.740]   in the 17th century because NATO expanded.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.080]   They had no choice, their hands were tied.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.520]   They were compelled to treat their own population
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:37.560]   like slaves because, you know, NATO expanded.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.620]   I mean, I could go on through the examples
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:43.540]   of Russian history that predate the existence,
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.100]   let alone the expansion of NATO,
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:51.100]   where you have behavior, policies, actions
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:55.700]   very similar to what we see now from the Kremlin.
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:59.980]   And you can't explain those by NATO expansion, can you?
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:03.640]   And so that argument doesn't wash for me
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.660]   because I have a pattern here that predates NATO expansion.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:11.020]   I have international agreements, founding documents
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:16.020]   signed by the Kremlin over many, many decades
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.540]   acknowledging the freedom of countries
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.580]   to choose their alliances.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.200]   And then I have this problem where when you rape somebody,
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.940]   it's not because they're wearing a short skirt.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.280]   It's because you have raped them.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:34.920]   You've committed a criminal act, Lex.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.580]   - I think there's a lot of people listening to this
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:41.500]   that will agree to the emotion, the power,
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.500]   and the spirit of this metaphor.
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.820]   And I was struggling to think how to dance
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.540]   within this metaphor because it feels like
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.680]   it wasn't precisely the right one,
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.720]   but I think that it captures the spirit.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:58.940]   - I'm not suggesting, Lex, that everything the West has done
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:02.980]   has been honorable or intelligent.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.260]   Fortunately, we live in a democracy.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.900]   We live in liberal regimes.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.180]   We live under rule of law,
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:13.460]   liberal in the classical sense of rule of law.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.560]   Not liberal in the leftist sense.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:20.420]   We live in places like that and we can criticize ourselves.
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:22.980]   And we can criticize the mistakes that we made
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.860]   or the policy choices or the inactions that were taken.
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:30.620]   And there are a whole lot of things to answer for.
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:35.620]   And you can now discuss the ones that are your favorites,
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:39.420]   the dishonor or the mistakes.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.620]   And I could discuss mine.
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:44.980]   And we could spend the whole rest of our meeting today
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.300]   discussing the West's mistakes and problems.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.700]   - And we won't end up in prison for it.
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.580]   - Yeah, Lex, and so I'm thankful for that.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.720]   And I'm thankful that people may disagree
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.220]   and that people make the argument
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.700]   that NATO expansion is to blame.
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.860]   But you see, I'm countering two arguments here.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.020]   I'm countering one argument,
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:08.740]   which is very deeply popular, pervasive,
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:13.220]   about how Russia has this cultural tendency to aggression.
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.180]   And it can help but invade its neighbors
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.700]   and it does it again and again.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:21.040]   And it's eternal Russian imperialism.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.100]   And you have to watch out for it.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.100]   This very popular argument in the Baltic States.
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.540]   It's really popular in Warsaw.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.740]   It's really popular with the liberal interventionists.
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.400]   And it's very, very popular with those
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.660]   who were part of the Iraq War squad
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.220]   that got us into that mess.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.660]   So I'm against that.
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.500]   And the reason I'm against it is 'cause it's not true.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.760]   It's empirically false.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.560]   There is no cultural trait,
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   inherent tendency for Russia to be aggressive.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.140]   It's a strategic choice that they make.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.060]   - Every time it's a choice made,
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.520]   it's not some kind of momentum.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.500]   Every time it's a choice that we should judge
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.300]   for the choice that it is for the decision makers.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.100]   - And therefore they could make different choices.
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.020]   They could say, we don't have to stand up to the West.
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.820]   We don't have the capabilities to do that.
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.580]   We can still be a great country.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:13.180]   We can still be a civilization unto itself.
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.260]   We can still be Russia.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:19.140]   We can still worship in Orthodox cathedrals.
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.940]   We can still be ourselves,
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:25.960]   but we don't have to pursue this commerical pursuit,
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.260]   this elusive quest to stand up to the West
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.940]   and be in the first ranks of powers.
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.440]   So I'm countering that argument.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.820]   I'm saying it's perpetual geopolitics.
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.740]   It's a geopolitical choice rising out of this dilemma
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:44.960]   of the mismatch between aspirations and capabilities.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.980]   It's not eternal Russian imperialism.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.020]   And I'm also countering the other argument here, Lex,
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.860]   which is to say that it's the West's fault.
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.180]   It's Western imperialism.
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.940]   I'm very popular on the left,
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.560]   very popular with realist scholars,
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.340]   very popular with some of the people
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.900]   recently on your podcast.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:08.460]   And so it's neither eternal Russian imperialism,
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:11.300]   nor is it Western imperialism, right?
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.740]   The mere fact that the West is stronger than Russia
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.940]   is not a crime on the part of the West.
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:21.400]   It's not a crime that countries voluntarily
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.320]   wanna join the West, that beg to get in,
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:29.320]   either the EU or NATO or other bilateral alliances
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.660]   or other trade agreements.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:34.500]   Those are voluntarily entered into,
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.900]   and that's not criminal.
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:39.220]   If the West's sphere of influence, which is open,
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:42.340]   an open sphere of influence, which, as I say,
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.360]   people voluntarily join, if that expands,
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.180]   that's not a crime, nor is that a threat
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.780]   to Russia ipso facto, right?
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.060]   NATO is a defensive alliance,
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:54.060]   and the countries are largely pacifists
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.860]   who are members of NATO.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.380]   And NATO doesn't attack.
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:00.780]   It defends members if they are attacked.
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.420]   And so the idea that Ukraine, which had the legal right,
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:08.380]   might wanna join NATO and the EU,
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.020]   which was not gonna happen in our lifetimes
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:13.420]   and was not a direct threat to the Putin regime
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:18.420]   since the Western countries that make up the EU and NATO
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:24.380]   decided that Ukraine was not ready for membership,
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.820]   there was no consensus, it was not gonna happen,
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:31.460]   but it's Ukraine's free choice to express that desire.
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.340]   And if your government is elected by your people,
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:39.020]   freely elected, meaning you can unelect that government
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.700]   in the next election, and that government
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.400]   makes foreign policy choices on the basis
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.300]   of its perceived interests, that's not a crime, Lex.
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.220]   That's not a provocation.
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.660]   That's not something that compels the leader
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.960]   of another country to invade you, right?
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.100]   That is legal under international law,
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.100]   and it's also a realist fact of life.
[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:06.780]   The realists like to tell you that Russia here
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.760]   was disrespected, Russia's interests
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.340]   were not taken into account, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:15.140]   But the real world works in such a way
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:19.080]   that treaties matter, that international law matters.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.380]   That's why people like me were not in favor
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:25.820]   of the US 2003 invasion of Iraq, Lex,
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.260]   because it wasn't legal, in addition to the fact
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:31.120]   that we thought it might backfire.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.580]   But you know, Lex, like I said,
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.260]   there are a lot of things about the West
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:38.940]   that we ought to criticize as citizens,
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.860]   and we do criticize.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:45.860]   But we have to be clear about where responsibility lies
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.820]   in these events that we're talking about today.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:51.980]   - So you get to trouble, it's largely erroneous
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:56.140]   to think about both the West or the United States
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:57.660]   from an imperialist perspective,
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.340]   and Russia from an imperialist perspective.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:03.980]   It's better, clearer to think about each individual
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.360]   aggressive decision on its own as a choice that was made.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.580]   So let's talk about the most recent choice
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.240]   made by Vladimir Putin.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:17.860]   The choice to invade Ukraine, or to escalate
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.800]   the invasion of Ukraine on February 24th, 2022.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:26.820]   Now we're a few months removed from that decision,
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.660]   initial decision.
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:30.580]   Why do you think he did it?
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:35.540]   What are the errors in understanding the situation,
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.940]   in calculating the outcomes,
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:42.640]   and everything else about this decision, in your view?
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:48.180]   - Yeah, Lex, when a war doesn't go well,
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:52.420]   it looks like lunacy to have launched it in the first place.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.140]   - Does it ever go well?
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:56.860]   - War never goes according to plan.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.940]   All war is based upon miscalculation,
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:03.820]   but not everybody is punished for their miscalculation.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:07.660]   All aggressive war we're talking about, not defensive war,
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:10.180]   is based upon miscalculation.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.700]   But you can adjust, you can recalibrate.
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.740]   You know, when you're driving down the road,
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.420]   and that very annoying voice is telling you,
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:23.300]   in a thousand feet, make a right,
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.380]   and you fail to make a right, it recalibrates, right?
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.780]   It tells you, okay, now, you know, go turn around,
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.900]   or U-turn, or make a left.
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:33.340]   It doesn't say you're an idiot,
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:37.060]   and turn around and make a U-turn, but it does recalibrate.
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.260]   So you can miscalculate, and the problem
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.180]   is not the miscalculation, usually,
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:45.460]   it's the failure to do that adjustment, right?
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:49.160]   People I know who are hedge fund traders,
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:52.900]   I ask them, you know, what's your favorite trade?
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.260]   And the line from the mall, and this is a cliche,
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.960]   is my favorite trade is when I made a mistake,
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.660]   but I got out early before all the carnage.
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:04.860]   So their favorite trade is not when they made
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:08.700]   some brilliant choice, but it's when they miscalculated,
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:12.140]   but they reduced the consequences of their miscalculation
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.860]   by recalibrating quickly, right?
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.740]   So let's talk about the calculation
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.420]   and miscalculation of February.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.780]   Let's imagine, Lex, that you've been getting away
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:22.700]   with murder.
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:26.500]   I don't mean murder in a figurative sense.
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.820]   I mean, you've been murdering people.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.820]   You've been murdering them domestically,
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.840]   and you've been murdering them all across Europe,
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:37.540]   and you've been murdering them not just with, for example,
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:43.540]   a car accident, a staged car accident, or using a handgun.
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:49.500]   You used Novichok, or you used some other
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:53.080]   internationally outlawed chemical weapon.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:56.680]   And let's imagine that you did it,
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.800]   and nothing happened to you.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.380]   It wasn't like you were removed from power.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:04.040]   It wasn't like you paid a personal price.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.940]   Sure, maybe there was some sanctions on your economy,
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:09.660]   but you didn't pay the price of those sanctions.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:12.660]   Little people paid the price of those sanctions.
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:15.820]   Other people in your country paid the price.
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.620]   Let's imagine not only were you murdering people literally,
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:24.620]   but you decided to entice the idiotic ruler of Georgia
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:32.320]   into a provocation that you could then invade the country.
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.080]   And you invaded the country,
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.440]   and you bid off these territories,
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.940]   Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.740]   And what price did you pay for that?
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:44.820]   And then you decided, you know,
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:49.260]   I think I'll now invade Crimea, and forcibly annex Crimea.
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:53.100]   And I'll instigate an insurrection in the Donbas,
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:56.060]   in eastern Ukraine, in Luhansk.
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.020]   Let's imagine you did all that,
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:00.220]   and then you had to stick out your wrist
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:04.300]   so that it could be slapped a couple of times.
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.580]   And you said, you know, I can pretty much do what I want.
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.920]   They're putting a sanction here and there,
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.020]   and they're doing this, and they're doing that.
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:14.420]   And you know what?
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:17.380]   They're more energy dependent on me than before.
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.980]   I got better money laundering
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:21.860]   and reputation services than anybody has.
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:23.620]   Maybe the Middle East and the Chinese
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:26.300]   would disagree with you that you have better than them,
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.500]   but yours are pretty good.
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.420]   And the Panama Papers get released
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:34.120]   revealing all of your offshoring and your corruption,
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.020]   and what happened?
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:36.700]   Nothing happens, Lex.
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:40.140]   So the first and most important consideration here is,
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:44.300]   in your own mind, you've been getting away with murder,
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.860]   literally, as well as figuratively,
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:50.340]   and you think, you know, I probably can do something again
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.400]   and get away with it.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:55.920]   And so the failure to respond at scale,
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.580]   in fact, the indulgences,
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:01.700]   the further dependencies that are introduced,
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:05.500]   the illusion that trade is the mechanism
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.300]   to manage authoritarian regimes.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:11.120]   You know that great German cliche,
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.540]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.780]   right, change through trade,
[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:18.520]   or transformation through trade,
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:22.480]   one of Angela Merkel's favorite expressions, right?
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.840]   You're gonna get the other side to be better.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:31.800]   Rather than confront them in a Cold War fashion,
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:33.680]   where you stand up to their aggressions
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.240]   and you punish them severely
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.700]   in order to deter further behavior.
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.840]   So that's the first and most important part
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.680]   of the calculation miscalculation.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.120]   There are a lot of other dimensions.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.920]   - Can we pause on that really quick?
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:48.760]   So this is kind of idea of it's okay
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.880]   to crack a few eggs to make an omelet,
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:55.400]   which is a more generous description of what you're saying,
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:53:00.280]   that you don't incorporate into the calculation
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:04.080]   the amount of human suffering that the decisions cause,
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:08.640]   but instead you look at sort of the success
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.880]   based on some kind of measure for you personally,
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.040]   and for the nation,
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:17.720]   not in terms of in a humanitarian sense,
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:19.800]   but in some kind of economic sense,
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.440]   and a geopolitical power sense.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.640]   - Yeah, you're not sentimental, Lex.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:26.960]   You say to yourself,
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:31.520]   the cause of Russian greatness
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.080]   is greater than any individual life.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:38.560]   Russia being in the first rank of the great powers,
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:43.560]   Russia realizing its mission to be a special country
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.280]   with a special mission in the world,
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:48.280]   a civilization unto itself,
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:51.960]   the first rank of the great powers,
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.960]   maybe even the greatest power,
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:58.080]   that's worth the price that we have to pay,
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.000]   especially in other people's lives.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.880]   We have a lot of literature on the Putin regime,
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.760]   which talks about the kleptocracy.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:10.420]   The place is a kleptocracy, and it is a kleptocracy.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:13.760]   We all can see that,
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:17.360]   and anybody in London living the high life
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.240]   servicing this kleptocracy
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.760]   can testify that it's a kleptocracy,
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.660]   and not only in London, of course,
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.920]   right here in the United States, in New York.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:30.880]   But you know, it's not only a kleptocracy, Lex.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.960]   That was the problem of the Russian studies literature.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:38.700]   It wasn't just about stealing, looting the state.
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:41.080]   It was about Russian greatness.
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:44.240]   You see those rituals in the Kremlin,
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.560]   right in the Grand Kremlin Palace,
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.840]   in the St. George's Hall,
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:52.080]   some of the greatest interiors in the world.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.360]   And you see award ceremonies,
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.400]   and you see marking holidays,
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.680]   and all of these looters of the state
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.480]   have their uniforms on with their medals,
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.640]   and someone's giving a speech or singing a ballad,
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.220]   and their eyes are moist.
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:12.440]   Their eyes are moist because they're thieves and looters?
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:16.920]   No, Lex, because they believe in Russian greatness.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:20.400]   They have a deep and fundamental,
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.920]   passionate commitment to the greatness of Russia,
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.600]   which in unsentimental fashion,
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.560]   they're all sentimental to the max.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.520]   That's why their eyes are moistening.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:35.400]   But they imagine unsentimentally that any sacrifice is okay,
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.040]   a sacrifice of other people's lives,
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:41.600]   a sacrifice of their conscripts in the military,
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:45.900]   a sacrifice of Ukrainian women and children and elderly.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.920]   That's a small price to pay for those moist eyes
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.400]   about Russian greatness and Russia's position in the world.
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:56.000]   - Well, that human thing, that sentimentality,
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.280]   is a thing that can get us in trouble
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.080]   in the United States as well,
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:02.520]   and lead us to wars, illegal wars and so on.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:03.640]   But the United States,
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:08.200]   there's repercussions for breaking the law.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.840]   You're going to pay for illegal wars in the end.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:14.440]   You're saying that in authoritarian regimes,
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.980]   the sentimentality can really get out of hand.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:19.940]   And by charismatic leaders that can take that
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:23.100]   to manipulate the populace to make that,
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.340]   in the span of history, led to atrocities,
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:30.120]   and in today's world, lead to humanitarian crises.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:33.280]   - It's not just a kleptocracy, it's a belief system.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.620]   It's passion, it's conviction.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:41.500]   You can call them illusions, you can call them fantasies.
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:44.140]   Whatever you want to call them, they're real.
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:45.860]   They're real for those people.
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:48.980]   And so yes, they're looting that very state
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:50.180]   that they're trying to make
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:52.340]   one of the great powers in the world.
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:55.860]   And they resent the fact that the West
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:58.360]   doesn't acknowledge them as one of those great powers.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.200]   And they resent that the West is more powerful.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:05.900]   People talk about how Putin doesn't understand the world,
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:08.380]   and that he gets really bad information.
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:10.700]   Lex, if you're sitting there in that Kremlin,
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:14.260]   and you're trying to conduct business in the world,
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:16.940]   and you're getting reports from your finance minister,
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.700]   or your central bank governor,
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.900]   your whole economy, everything that matters,
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:25.980]   somehow all your trade is denominated in dollars and euros,
[00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:30.540]   do you have any illusions about who controls
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.740]   the international financial system?
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.080]   I don't think so, Lex.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:39.520]   You looking over your industrial plan for the next year,
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.380]   and you're looking over how many tanks you're gonna get,
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.620]   and how many cruise missiles you're gonna get,
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:46.740]   and how many submarines you're gonna get,
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:49.660]   and fill in the blank.
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:51.220]   And you know what?
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.100]   It says right there in the paperwork
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:54.980]   where the component parts come from,
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:56.900]   where the software comes from,
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:59.060]   comes from the West, Lex.
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:01.260]   Your whole military industrial complex
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:04.180]   is dependent on high-end Western technology.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:08.660]   And let's say you're in Beijing, not just in Moscow,
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:11.620]   and you go to a meeting in your own neighborhood.
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:13.440]   You're the leader of China.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.920]   You go to a meeting with other Asian leaders.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:19.940]   Do they all speak in Chinese with you?
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:22.840]   No, Lex, they don't speak Chinese.
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.460]   You go to an international meeting as the leader of China,
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:29.120]   and guess what language is the main language of intercourse?
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:32.000]   Yes, the same one you and I are speaking right now.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.760]   And so you live in that world.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:36.280]   You live in the Western world,
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.620]   and it's very hard to have illusions
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:40.620]   about what world you live in
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:44.300]   when you're under that, you need those Western banks.
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.800]   You need that foreign currency, right?
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:49.000]   You need that high-end Western technology,
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.080]   that technology transfer.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.280]   You're speaking, or you're forced to speak,
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.960]   or your minions are forced to speak
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.440]   at international gatherings in English.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.640]   And I could go on.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.240]   All the indicators that you live in,
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.000]   and so Putin lives in that world.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.520]   He's no fool.
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:07.360]   - Well, to push back, isn't it possible that,
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:11.040]   as you said, the minions operate in that world,
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:14.040]   but can't you, if you're the leader of Russia,
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.200]   or the leader of China,
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.240]   or the leader of these different nations,
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:22.480]   still put up walls where actually when you think
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.680]   in the privacy of your own mind,
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:27.600]   you exist not in the international world,
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.320]   but in a world where there's this great Russian empire,
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.160]   or this great Chinese empire.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.600]   - Yes. - And then you forget
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.440]   that there's English.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.960]   You forget that there's technology in iPhones.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.860]   You forget that there's all of this,
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:43.560]   US keeps popping up on all different paperwork.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:46.640]   That just becomes the blurry details that dissipate,
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:51.300]   because what matters is the greatness of this dream empire
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:54.240]   that I have in my mind as a dictator.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.680]   - I would put it this way, Lex.
[00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.680]   After you absorb all of that from your minions,
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:06.700]   and it impresses upon your consciousness where you live,
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.540]   you live in a Western-dominated world,
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:12.720]   that the multipolar world doesn't exist,
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.320]   your goal is to make that multipolar world exist.
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.180]   Your goal is to bring down the West.
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.960]   Your goal is for the West to weaken.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.020]   Your goal is a currency other than the dollar and the euro.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:28.900]   Your goal is an international financial system
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.260]   that you dominate.
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:34.160]   Your goal is technological self-sufficiency
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.860]   made in China 2035, right?
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:40.260]   Your goal is a world that you dominate,
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.380]   not that the West dominates.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:45.120]   And you're gonna do everything you can
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.700]   to try to attain that world,
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.980]   which is a Russian-centric world,
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.220]   or a Chinese-centric world,
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:56.180]   or what we could call a Eurasian-centric world.
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.380]   And it's not gonna be easy, Lex,
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:02.380]   just for the reasons that we enumerated before.
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.820]   But maybe you're gonna get a helping hand.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.500]   Maybe the West is gonna transfer
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.020]   their best technology to you.
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.700]   They're gonna sell you their best stuff.
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:13.740]   And then you're gonna absorb it,
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.860]   and maybe copy it, and reverse-engineer it.
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.120]   And if they won't sell it to you,
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.860]   maybe you'll just have to steal it.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:23.740]   Maybe the West is gonna allow you to bank,
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:27.780]   even though you violate many laws
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.140]   that would prohibit the West
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.620]   from extending those banking services to you.
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:35.540]   Maybe the West is gonna buy your energy,
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:38.260]   and your palladium, and your titanium,
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.500]   and your rare metals like lithium,
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.580]   because you're willing to have your poor people
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:48.680]   mine that stuff, and die of disease at an early age.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.820]   But Western governments, they don't wanna do that.
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:53.700]   They don't wanna do that dirty mining
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:56.500]   of those very important rare earths.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.620]   But you're willing to do that,
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.260]   because it's just people whose lives
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:02.060]   you don't care about as an autocratic regime.
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.480]   That's the world you live in,
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.060]   where you're trying to get to this other world.
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.860]   You're at the center of the other world.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.220]   You dominate the other world.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.740]   But the only way to get there, Lex,
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:18.460]   is the West has to weaken, divide itself,
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.700]   maybe even collapse.
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:25.180]   And so you're encouraging, to the extent possible,
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:28.700]   Western divisions, Western disunity,
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:33.580]   Western lack of resolve, Western mistakes,
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:36.680]   and Western invasion of the wrong country,
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.820]   and Western destruction of its credibility
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.020]   through international financial crises,
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:44.180]   and one could go on.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:48.020]   So if the West weakens itself through its mistakes
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:51.200]   and its own corruption, you're gonna survive
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.420]   and maybe even come out into that world
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.940]   where you're the center.
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:58.660]   And so Russia's entire grand strategy,
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.540]   just like China's grand strategy,
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:03.100]   Iran, it's hard to say they have a grand strategy
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.700]   because they're so profoundly weak.
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:11.740]   But Russia's grand strategy is we're a mess.
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.160]   We don't invest in our human capital.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.900]   Our human capital flees, or we actually drive it out.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:21.100]   It goes to MIT, like you did,
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:23.740]   or it goes to fill in the blank, right?
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.760]   We can't invest in our people.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.460]   Our healthcare is terrible.
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.600]   Our education system is in decline.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.340]   We don't build infrastructure, Lex.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.980]   We don't improve our governance.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.620]   We don't invest in those attributes of modern power
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:42.040]   that make the West powerful.
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:46.180]   We can't because when we try, the money is stolen.
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:49.260]   We try these grandiose projects of,
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.860]   national projects, they're called.
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.380]   We're gonna invest in higher ed.
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.580]   We're gonna invest in high tech.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:57.820]   We're gonna build our own Silicon Valley,
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:58.820]   known as Skolkovo.
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.500]   We're gonna do all those things, and what happens?
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.020]   They can't even build an airport
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:04.780]   without the money disappearing.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.700]   The Sochi Olympics, Lex,
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:11.100]   officially cost them $50 billion.
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:14.260]   You look around at the infrastructure that endured
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:17.100]   from that $50 billion expense,
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.540]   and you're thinking, you know,
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:20.980]   that's like the Second Avenue subway.
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.940]   You get almost nothing for your money.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:25.900]   And so yeah, it's corruption, Lex,
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.700]   but it's also because they don't wanna do that.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:31.340]   They don't wanna invest in their people.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:33.520]   They couldn't do it if they wanted to,
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.300]   and when they try, it doesn't work.
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.360]   But why invest in your own people?
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:43.400]   Invest in your hardware, your military hardware, right?
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:47.440]   Invest in your cyber capabilities.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.200]   Invest in all your spoilation techniques
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.420]   and your hard power,
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:57.300]   and invest in further corrupting and further weakening
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:00.200]   and further dividing the West,
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.760]   because as I said, if the West is weak,
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.160]   divided, lacking resolve,
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.840]   you don't invest in your people,
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.320]   you don't build infrastructure,
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.760]   you don't improve your governance,
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.640]   but you'll muddle through.
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.600]   That's Russian grand strategy.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.960]   - So invest in the hard power,
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.120]   weaken the West,
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:21.360]   those combined together means you're going to be
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:24.560]   subtly incentivized to escalate
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.440]   any military aggressive conflicts
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.200]   that are around you or create new ones or--
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.680]   - If you can get away with murder.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.520]   But what happens, Lex,
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.800]   if it's a Harry Truman-like response?
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.560]   What happens if somebody says,
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.100]   you know, we're gonna stand up to this?
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:45.480]   We're not gonna allow this to happen.
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.780]   We're not gonna launder your money anymore.
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:52.040]   We're not gonna be dependent on you for energy
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.160]   in the long term.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.920]   We're gonna make a transition.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:59.400]   We're gonna punish you for that kind of behavior instead.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.920]   And the West is now switched to that
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:07.920]   only because of the courage
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.880]   and ingenuity of the Ukrainian people.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:15.080]   The Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:20.080]   was one of the greatest gifts the West has ever received.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.840]   The sacrifices that the Ukrainians are making
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.380]   right now as we speak,
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:31.560]   meaning they're fighting a war by themselves
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:34.820]   against the major military power, their neighbor, Russia.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:37.880]   Nobody's fighting it with them.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.300]   Yes, we are giving them weapons
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.260]   so they can conduct self-defense,
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:45.760]   which by the way is legal under international law.
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.120]   Unlike the Russian invasion,
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:51.020]   which is illegal under international law,
[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:54.220]   Western supply of weapons, including heavy weapons,
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:58.160]   including offensive weapons to Ukraine for its self-defense
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.360]   in the invasion by Russia is actually legal under.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:06.360]   And so thank God the Ukrainians surprised everybody
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:11.160]   they surprised me, they surprised Putin in the Kremlin,
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.160]   they surprised the Biden administration,
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.880]   they surprised the European Union,
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.880]   not with the fact that they would resist.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:23.440]   We knew that we had the Orange Revolution in 2004,
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.920]   we had Maidan in 2013, 14,
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.680]   where they rose up against a domestic tyrant
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:34.960]   and they were willing to die on behalf of their country
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.660]   then let alone against a foreign tyrant
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.620]   invading their country, right?
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:40.900]   So we knew they would resist,
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.080]   we didn't know just how successful,
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:46.080]   certainly I didn't know they would be on the battlefield.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.320]   It's been breathtaking to watch.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:52.480]   That sacrifice, that gift enabled the West
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.840]   to rediscover itself, to rediscover its power,
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.020]   to revive itself, to say,
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:00.760]   the hell with this energy dependence in the long term,
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.320]   the hell with this money laundering
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.220]   and reputation laundering,
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:07.280]   the hell with this running back and forth to Moscow
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.200]   to try to see what Putin needs
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.640]   in order for him to feel respected,
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.160]   what appeasement he needs, right?
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.960]   So we'll see if it endures,
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:21.000]   but this shift comes from the Ukrainians.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.680]   And so it's no longer getting away with murder, Lex,
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.680]   and we thank the Ukrainians for that.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.740]   - The people and the leadership
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:32.740]   and the separate factions that make up Ukraine uniting,
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:37.080]   it's the unification, the uniting against the common enemy
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.320]   and standing up before anyone knew
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.140]   that they would be backed by all of these other nations,
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.180]   by this money and all this kind of stuff,
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:49.160]   standing there, especially with the President Zelensky,
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:54.160]   where it makes total sense to flee, he stood his ground.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:56.920]   - Yes, Lex, let's take that point that you just raised,
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.700]   which is a deep and fundamental point,
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.640]   and I thank you for that.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.920]   - Do you guys hear that?
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.520]   I think that was a compliment, there we go, let's go.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.360]   (laughs)
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.080]   - Lex-- - Zelensky unification.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.640]   - I'm sitting here in front of you.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.360]   - Thank you, it's an honor.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.780]   - And it's a mutual honor.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:17.020]   So Ukraine before the war
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:20.600]   is run by a TV production company, right?
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:24.480]   You're one guy running this fantastic, incredible podcast.
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:28.600]   There's 20 guys or so running a country the size of Ukraine.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.320]   And one's a producer and one's like a makeup person,
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:35.040]   and one's a video editor,
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.820]   and they're fantastically talented people
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:42.120]   if your country is a TV production.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:47.120]   So before the war, Zelensky had what, 25% approval rating?
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.320]   And he couldn't get much done, and it wasn't working.
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:53.320]   He got elected with 73%, as you know,
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:56.560]   and then he was down to 20, that's a pretty big drop.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:01.040]   And so you're thinking maybe having a major, large size,
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:05.040]   40 million plus population European country
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.840]   run by a TV production company is not the best choice.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.580]   And then what do we see?
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:16.440]   We see President Zelensky decides to risk his life
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.760]   on behalf of his country, Ukraine.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.960]   He decides to stay in the capital.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.660]   He's not gonna flee, they're gonna stay and fight.
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.840]   And he could be killed, he can die.
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.360]   It's a decision where he put his life on the line.
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:35.880]   Obviously, he's Jewish descent,
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.920]   Russian speaking childhood and upbringing.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:44.560]   Russian speaking Jewish descent puts his life on the line
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.560]   for the country of Ukraine.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.700]   It's a pretty big message, don't you think?
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.440]   And it's crucial.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.560]   And it turns out not only that, Lex,
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.800]   but they're good at TV.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.040]   They're good at information war.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.780]   And in a war, it's a TV production company
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.700]   and a TV personality.
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.960]   That's exactly what you want running a country
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:11.360]   because they're crushing in the information war.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.380]   And he's spectacular.
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:18.380]   European Parliament, US Congress, Israeli Parliament,
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:23.000]   there's no room on Zoom, let alone in person,
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.640]   that he can't win over.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.640]   He's just so effective.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.720]   This is the first time reality TV
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:33.380]   has been about reality instead of fake.
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:37.120]   Reality TV is just this completely fake nonsense.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:41.080]   But Zelensky, this is real reality TV.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.280]   And he means it.
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:45.820]   And the nation is behind him.
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:47.540]   And they're just as courageous
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.320]   and just as ingenious in many ways.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.460]   And it's spectacular.
[01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:55.680]   And so, yeah, who saw that coming?
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.760]   I didn't see that coming, Lex.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:58.960]   In fact, the Biden,
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:01.240]   we talk about Putin's miscalculation.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.060]   The Biden administration, as you alluded to,
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.760]   offered him an exit from the country.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.320]   They didn't say, you know, you wanna stand and fight?
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.640]   We'll back you.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.560]   They said, we'll get you out.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.080]   You wanna come now?
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.880]   And famously, you know that quote, right?
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.700]   What he said about how he doesn't need a ride.
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:21.720]   Remember that? - Yeah.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:22.720]   - That moment?
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.560]   The Biden administration was poised
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.760]   to do another Afghanistan moment.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.360]   That ignominious exit from Afghanistan
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:35.000]   was almost what happened in Ukraine
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.840]   when Biden administration offered him that ride out of there.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.040]   And fortunately, he declined and helped rally.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:47.280]   And the people from below also rallied to stop the invader
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.840]   without the presidency and without the government in Ukraine
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:55.280]   saving the Biden administration and the European leaders
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.240]   who latched on.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.640]   Fortunately, they had the presence of mind
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.400]   to latch onto this gift,
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:04.480]   this bravery and ingeniousness of Zelensky
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.160]   and the rest of the Ukrainians,
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:11.040]   and flipped and decided to support Ukraine's resistance.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:13.880]   You know, first with 5,000 helmets only,
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.720]   as the Germans initially promised,
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.600]   and now with really heavy weapons.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.880]   And so that's something that wasn't foreseen.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.660]   I certainly didn't foresee that.
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:28.960]   I foresaw the Ukrainian society being courageous
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.920]   and resisting, but I didn't foresee
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.640]   a television production company
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.560]   being exactly what you want to run a country in a war,
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:42.860]   a president Zelensky willing to sacrifice,
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:45.440]   lay down his life and rallying others
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.280]   in the country to do that.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:50.160]   And then the country being so effective,
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:55.160]   not just at courage, but at battlefield resistance
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.920]   to the Russian invasion.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:59.440]   So I stand corrected by the Ukrainians,
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:03.300]   and I'm ecstatic that I was wrong,
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:04.520]   that I was proven wrong.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.920]   - And like I said, there's clear factions of the West
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.640]   and the East of Ukraine, and here's a person that,
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.920]   like you said, was in the high 20s, low 30s percentage
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.760]   approval in the country before the war,
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.400]   and now was able to use--
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.160]   - He's in the 90s now. - In the 90s.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.840]   - He's in the 90% approval rating.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:29.840]   I mean, I think they stopped doing the polling.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.640]   Once he hit 91% or whatever it was in the previous poll,
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.760]   I think they all understood that for now
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:38.120]   they didn't need any more polling,
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.680]   that it's pretty clear the nation.
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:43.360]   So 25% to 90 something percent.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:47.120]   And just like the 25% was deserved,
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:50.600]   the 90 something percent is also deserved, fully deserved.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.280]   - And the question is how that all stabilizes.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:58.280]   It feels like this set of events,
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:02.400]   I may be paying attention to Twitter too much,
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.840]   which is a concern of mine,
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:09.560]   whether the change I see is just surface level
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:13.760]   or deep level, but it seems like we're in a new world.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.720]   That something dramatic has shifted.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:21.400]   That this power that's rooted, I mean,
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:25.520]   in your study of the 20th century,
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.120]   it's so deeply rooted in history.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.520]   There's this power center of the world
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:33.520]   is now going to, has been shaken by this event.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:37.880]   And how that changes the world is unclear.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.800]   It's unclear what lesson China learns from watching this,
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.080]   what lesson India learns from watching this.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.480]   Both nations, as far as you can get polls
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:49.240]   about Chinese population, but both nations
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.760]   are largely in support of Putin.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:55.040]   So Russia, India, and China are still
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.400]   supporting of Putin quietly.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:02.400]   - I would maybe elaborate a little bit on that point, Lex.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.880]   I think you're right.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.440]   The feeling that we're in an inflection moment,
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:12.520]   you know, an inflection point, I think that's widespread.
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.720]   And I think it's widespread for good reason.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.480]   We might be.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.480]   But I also share your, let's say,
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:26.200]   modesty about where it's going
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:29.600]   and how hard it is to predict where this might go.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.080]   It's only an inflection point if the trends continue, right?
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.160]   If the trends endure.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.960]   There are plenty of non-inflection points.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:42.920]   After 9/11, the whole world rallied around the United States
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:47.480]   after it was attacked, after the bombing of the towers
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:50.200]   here in New York City and the hitting of the Pentagon.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.240]   And that didn't last.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:56.640]   And it was not really an inflection point, was it?
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:59.680]   It felt like it might be, but it wasn't.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:01.880]   And so this is not a comparable moment
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:04.240]   in terms of what happened,
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.120]   but it has the feeling that it might be a watershed.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:12.440]   And maybe we'll squander it the way we squandered
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:16.840]   the post 9/11 rallying around the United States.
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:21.320]   Maybe we'll actually consolidate it and it'll endure,
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:24.160]   or maybe it'll endure despite ourselves.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:26.800]   And we can't tell and we can't know yet.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:30.560]   And it depends in part on what we do and what we don't do.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.320]   But here's a few things that we understand already.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:38.560]   The idea that the West was in decline
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.060]   and that the rest of the world had risen
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:45.120]   and was more powerful and that we lived
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:47.120]   in a multipolar world,
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:49.520]   that turns out to be empirically false.
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.480]   It's not true.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:54.320]   I mean, it's just factually not true.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:18:00.000]   There are no major important multinational institutions,
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.480]   organizations that are run on behalf of,
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.480]   or led by a South African, a Nigerian person from India.
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:14.920]   Even the Chinese don't run these institutions.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:18.120]   They would like to, and they're trying, but they don't.
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:23.640]   And so whatever you pick, the IMF, the World Bank,
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:27.400]   the Federal Reserve, which is the most powerful
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.160]   multinational institution, which is actually
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:33.140]   only a domestic institution and doesn't have
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:37.500]   a legal mandate to act multilaterally, but does.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:41.120]   It's got the most power of any institution in the world.
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:45.800]   NATO, the bilateral alliances that the US has
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.080]   up and down Asia.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:53.480]   What organizations that have tremendous leverage
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.520]   on the international system, on the international order
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.520]   are non-Western.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:04.400]   The UN is the most encompassing.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.360]   And of course we know that the five,
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.200]   it has five members of the Security Council with a veto.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.520]   One of which is Russia, one of which is China,
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:16.040]   and the others are the US, Britain, and France.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.040]   Not India, not South Africa, not Indonesia,
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:25.680]   not all of these other countries where the people live.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.400]   Right, the bulk of the population of the world.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.160]   And where the population is growing,
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.240]   like on the African continent.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:34.560]   So it's not a multipolar world.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:38.040]   We talked already about the international financial system.
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.320]   That's the Western, not multipolar.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.760]   We talked about the US military and NATO,
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:45.080]   or we could talk about the Japanese military,
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.320]   which is just very formidable.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.040]   Enormous number of platforms.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:54.200]   Even the Australian military we could talk about, right?
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.680]   And so it's a Western dominated world.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:01.480]   And the West, remember, is not a geographic concept.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:05.720]   It is an institutional and values club.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:10.000]   The Japanese are not European, but they're Western.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.160]   Just like Russia is European, but not Western.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.840]   'Cause European is a cultural category,
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:19.600]   and Western is an institutional category.
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:22.640]   Where you have rule of law, and separation of powers,
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.200]   and free and open public sphere,
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.160]   and dynamic open market economy.
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.280]   Okay.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:31.400]   And then we have another thing which is pretty clear.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:35.000]   The West is powerfully resented,
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.680]   powerfully envied, and admired simultaneously.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:43.200]   P.J. O'Rourke, the comedian who died this year,
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:48.400]   fantastic, it was a big loss for the culture.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.840]   He said, "There are two things
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.640]   "that are always characteristic
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.880]   "of any American embassy abroad.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:59.320]   "One is a political protest outside,
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.120]   "and the other is the longest line
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.600]   "you've ever seen for visas."
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:08.640]   And those things are true simultaneously.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.400]   And that's the world we live in.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:12.960]   Meaning that non-Western countries
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:17.440]   envy and admire the West,
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:20.760]   but they also resent the power of the West.
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:23.000]   Western hypocrisy, right?
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.920]   The West invades countries when it wants,
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:30.440]   but when others do that, it's illegal, right?
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:35.440]   The West arrests you for money laundering,
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.960]   but it's Western money laundering
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:41.760]   that is where you go when you need to launder money, right?
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.400]   So they see the hypocrisy,
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:48.560]   they see the excessive power that the West has,
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:49.760]   and they resent it.
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:55.240]   And they say, "Who elected you to run the world?
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:58.420]   "We have a billion plus people,
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:02.480]   "or we have 200 plus million people,
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:04.880]   "and we don't have a say.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:08.440]   "You're the self-appointed guardians of our world.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.560]   "Who did that?"
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.600]   And so it's incumbent on the West
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:15.440]   not only to remember the power that it has,
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:19.000]   but also to exercise that power
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.720]   legally and with restraint,
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:26.720]   and also to think about how it can expand institutions
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:29.460]   to be more encompassing,
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:31.320]   so that other parts of the world
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.060]   are not on the outside being dictated to,
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:39.500]   but instead are on the inside.
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.700]   Too often, right,
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:46.520]   Western power is not consultative
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.800]   in a decision-making fashion.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.680]   It's consultative after the fact.
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:54.920]   Okay, we got together in the EU,
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:57.240]   or we got together in NATO,
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.600]   or we got together at the Federal Reserve,
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.280]   and here's our decision,
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.780]   and we're announcing it today.
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:06.360]   And so your economy gets destroyed
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.040]   because the Federal Reserve decides
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.800]   it has to raise interest rates.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:14.460]   Or you now go into default.
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:15.640]   You can't pay your debt
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:18.320]   because Western banks lent you money,
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:21.640]   and now the West has changed interest rates
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:23.960]   or other considerations,
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:27.720]   and you're in big trouble now.
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:32.240]   And so this is something which we fail to address.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.480]   It's very hard to address.
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:36.960]   It's very hard to reform international institutions.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:39.860]   It's very hard to share power.
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:41.460]   It's very hard to acknowledge
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:43.260]   that you have too much power,
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.860]   and that maybe having too much power is not good,
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:51.240]   not only for the rest of the world, but for yourself.
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.760]   And so it's great to rediscover the West
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.500]   and rediscover its values
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:24:00.500]   and rediscover its authority and credibility and power,
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:03.000]   but that's not sufficient.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.680]   So we know this now.
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:07.320]   We know that the rest of the world
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:12.280]   is not necessarily jumping on the Western bandwagon, right,
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.960]   to condemn Russia for its actions,
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.380]   because the West can do things
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:20.400]   like sanction your central bank,
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.640]   take away your reserves,
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.600]   deny you technology.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.160]   It pretty much can do whatever it wants,
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.760]   and it can say that it's legal,
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.800]   and it can go through various mechanisms,
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.880]   and it can freeze your property,
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:34.920]   and you say to yourself,
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:37.360]   should anybody have that much power,
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.440]   and when do they come after me?
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.840]   Now, there's a caveat here.
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:47.320]   And the caveat, Lex, is they don't like the West
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.240]   having all of that power,
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:54.000]   and they didn't join in the condemnation of Russia,
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.420]   but they also didn't join in Russia's aggression.
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:02.360]   So Russia's domestic civilian
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:07.680]   aerospace, aircraft industry, right,
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.720]   civilian aircraft industry is in big trouble now
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.880]   because of the export controls
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:17.440]   on spare parts and software.
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.440]   Brazil is a major power in aircraft manufacturing.
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:25.380]   Did they rush in and say, you know,
[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:30.160]   Vladimir Putin, we didn't condemn necessarily
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:33.200]   your actions in Ukraine, okay, that's one thing,
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:37.480]   and how about we give you all of our aircraft technology,
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:41.600]   and we help you rebuild your domestic aircraft industry,
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.960]   and you can have the aviation that the West is,
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:45.520]   did that happen, Lex?
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.360]   Didn't happen.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.000]   And you can look at India, and you can look at China,
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.480]   and you can look at South Africa,
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.460]   and you can look at what they've done in practical terms.
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:58.100]   Yes, they haven't always joined
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:00.000]   in a full-throated condemnation.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.480]   Maybe they've been neutral,
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.540]   or maybe they've been playing both sides of the fence,
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:06.180]   like Turkey, for example.
[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:11.760]   But are they rushing in to join Russia,
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:14.520]   to join Russia's aggression, to supply,
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.600]   and the answer is no.
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.220]   And the answer is no for two reasons.
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:22.820]   One, they actually don't wanna be party to that.
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:26.240]   And two, they understand that Western power,
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.360]   and they don't wanna be on the receiving end
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.040]   by crossing the West and then getting caught up
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:35.680]   in a sanctions regime or worse.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.780]   - Can we go to the mind of Vladimir Putin,
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:42.420]   because what you just said, China, India,
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:45.620]   they seem to sit back and say,
[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:47.740]   "We're not going to condemn the actions
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:49.800]   "of Vladimir Putin and Russia,
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.460]   "but we would really like for this war to be over."
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:56.020]   So there's that kind of energy of,
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:58.040]   "We don't just stop this,
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:00.540]   "because you're putting us in a very, very bad position."
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:05.140]   And yet, Vladimir Putin is continuing the aggression.
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:06.520]   What is he thinking?
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.620]   What information is he getting?
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.820]   Is it the system that you've described
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:13.160]   of authoritarian regimes that corrupts
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.780]   your flow of information,
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:17.060]   your ability to make clear-headed decisions?
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:21.660]   Just as a human being, when you go to sleep at night,
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:24.100]   is he not able to see the world clearly,
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:27.540]   or is this all deliberate, systematic action
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:31.300]   that does have some reason behind it?
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:33.340]   - We gotta talk a little bit about China, too,
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:36.280]   but let's answer your Putin question directly.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:41.020]   So on Twitter, you've lost the war.
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:45.180]   Or as they say, there are these two Russian soldiers
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:47.020]   having a smoke in Warsaw,
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:51.100]   and they're taking a break, having a smoke,
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:53.580]   and they're sitting there in Warsaw on top of their tank,
[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:55.080]   and one says to the other,
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:57.520]   "Yeah, we lost the information war."
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.940]   And there they are, sitting in Warsaw,
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:02.320]   having that smoke, right?
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:07.080]   So yeah, on Twitter, Russia has completely lost the war.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.560]   In reality, they failed to take Kiev,
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.680]   they failed to capture Kiev,
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:15.840]   and they failed in phase two, as they called it,
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.840]   or plan B, which is to capture the entirety of the Donbas.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.480]   We're three months into the war.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:25.840]   If you had made a judgment about, let's say,
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:27.860]   the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union,
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:30.480]   a definitive judgment after three months,
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.900]   you might've got the outcome wrong there.
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:34.720]   If you had judged the Winter War,
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:39.720]   the 1939-40 Soviet invasion of Finland after three months,
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.560]   you would've got that wrong too,
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:43.080]   of what the outcome was gonna be.
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.520]   So we're early in the game here,
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.880]   and we have to be careful about any definitive judgments.
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:52.560]   But it is the case that so far,
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.160]   they failed to take Kiev,
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:57.600]   and they failed to capture the entirety of the Donbas,
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:02.040]   Luhansk, and Donetsk provinces, Eastern Ukraine,
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.640]   a part of Eastern Ukraine.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:09.040]   And they've been driven out of Kharkiv,
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:12.600]   and the area immediately surrounding Kharkiv.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.680]   They never captured Kharkiv, but they came close,
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.520]   but now the Ukrainians drove them back
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.560]   to the Russian border
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.080]   in that very large and important region.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:25.360]   So those look like battlefield losses
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.840]   that are impossible to explain away,
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.280]   if you're the regime in Russia,
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:32.460]   except by suppression of information.
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:36.100]   And as you know from Russian history, Lex,
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:40.720]   leaders in Russia have an easier time
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:44.360]   with a state of siege and deprivation
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.640]   than they do with explaining a lost war.
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:52.980]   But let's look at some other facts
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:55.040]   that are important to take into account.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000]   One, the Russian army has penetrated farther
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.160]   into Ukrainian territory since February, 2022,
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:08.160]   including in Kherson region,
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:12.800]   the famous Mariupol siege that just ended.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:18.720]   They have built a large presence
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:23.920]   in areas North of Crimea
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:28.600]   on the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea littoral ultimately,
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.440]   that they didn't previously hold.
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:35.200]   They're still fighting in Luhansk for full control
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.560]   over at least half of the Donbas,
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:41.400]   and Ukrainians are resisting fiercely.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:44.800]   But nonetheless, you can say
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.540]   that they've been driven out.
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:50.380]   On the contrary, farther penetration than the beginning.
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:53.560]   Ukraine doesn't have an economy anymore.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:58.400]   They have somewhere between 33 and 50% unemployment.
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:02.600]   It's hard to measure unemployment in a war economy,
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:04.200]   but their metallurgical industry,
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:09.200]   that Azov-style steel plant in Mariupol is a ruin now.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:14.040]   And a lot of farmers are not planting the fields
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.120]   because the harvest from the previous year
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:19.440]   still hasn't been sent, sold abroad
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:22.440]   because the ports are blockaded or destroyed.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:26.120]   And so you don't have an economy,
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:28.800]   and you need five billion or seven billion
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:33.300]   or eight billion dollars a month to meet your payroll,
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:37.780]   to feed your people, to keep your army in the field.
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:42.980]   That's a lot of money per month, and that's indefinite.
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:45.960]   That's as long as this blockade lasts.
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:49.200]   And so you don't have an economy anymore, you're indigent.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.200]   And even if you take the lower number,
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:55.640]   five billion as opposed to Zelensky's ask for seven billion,
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:57.920]   five billion is 60 billion a year.
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:01.720]   That's 60 billion this year, that's 60 billion next year.
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:03.560]   And so who's got that kind of money?
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:06.360]   Which Western taxpayers are ready?
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.120]   And if you use the seven or eight billion,
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.480]   you get up to 100 billion a year.
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:15.480]   The Biden, just signed, President Joe Biden just signed
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:22.240]   the bill making it law, $40 billion in aid to Ukraine.
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:24.520]   It's just an enormous sum.
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:28.560]   The economic piece of that is a month and a half,
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:33.560]   two months of Ukrainians covering Ukrainian expenditures.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:36.600]   That's it.
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:40.080]   And they're asking the G7, they're asking everybody.
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:44.220]   So you have no economy and no prospect of an economy
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:46.780]   until you evict the Russians from your territory.
[01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:52.620]   And then you have a Western unity, Western resolve.
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:56.100]   It lasts or it doesn't last, Lex.
[01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:58.140]   So you're President Putin
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:01.360]   and you've got more territory than before.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:05.580]   And you've got a stranglehold over the Ukrainian economy.
[01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:10.040]   And you've got a lot of the world neutral.
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:13.140]   And you've got the Chinese propaganda
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:17.340]   supporting you to the hilt with those Oliver Stone
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:21.680]   and Mearsheimer lines about how this is really NATO's fault.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:27.700]   And you've got Hungary dragging its feet
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:29.980]   on the oil embargo against Russia.
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:32.100]   And you've got Turkey dragging its feet
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:35.880]   on the recent applications of Sweden and Finland
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:36.860]   for NATO expansion.
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:38.500]   And you're saying to yourself,
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.240]   Lex, maybe I can ride this out.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:43.060]   I got a lot of problems of my own
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:44.460]   and we can go into the details
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:46.660]   on the Russian side's challenges.
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:52.540]   But he's on Ukrainian territory unless he's evicted.
[01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:56.060]   And he's got a stranglehold on their economy.
[01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:58.440]   And he's got the possibility
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:01.960]   that the West doesn't stay resolved
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.480]   and doesn't continue to pay for Ukraine's economy
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:08.100]   or supply those heavy weapons.
[01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:09.860]   And so you could argue
[01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:12.780]   that maybe he's deluded about all of this.
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:14.820]   And maybe he should go on Twitter.
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:15.700]   I'm not on Twitter,
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:18.260]   but maybe Putin who famously doesn't use the internet
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:21.100]   should go on Twitter and see he's losing the war.
[01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:24.840]   Or you can argue that maybe he's calculating here
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.960]   that he's got a chance to still prevail.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:33.500]   - Wow, that is darkly insightful.
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:38.020]   If I could go to Henry Kissinger for a brief moment.
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:40.900]   And people should read this op-ed
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:44.580]   he wrote in the Washington Post in March 5th, 2014
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:49.540]   after the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine,
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:51.880]   but before Crimea was annexed.
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:55.380]   There's a lot of interesting historical description
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:57.700]   about the division within Ukraine,
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:35:00.940]   the corruption within Ukraine that will,
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:02.300]   if people read this article,
[01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:05.860]   will give context to how incredible it is
[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:07.500]   what Zelensky was able to accomplish
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:08.460]   in uniting the country.
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:10.100]   But I just want to comment,
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:13.540]   because Henry Kissinger's an interesting figure
[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:14.940]   in American history.
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:16.380]   He opens the article with,
[01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:19.420]   "In my life, I have seen four wars
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:22.660]   begun with great enthusiasm and public support,
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:25.500]   all of which we did not know how to end,
[01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:29.820]   and from three of which we withdrew unilaterally.
[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:34.820]   The test of policy is how it ends, not how it begins."
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:38.540]   So he's giving this cold, hard truth
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:42.220]   that we go into wars excited,
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:46.180]   are able to send $40 billion financial aid,
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:50.500]   military aid, our own men and women,
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:53.500]   but the excitement fades.
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:56.460]   Twitter outrage fades.
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:36:00.780]   And then a country that's willing to wait patiently
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:04.340]   is willing to pay the cost of siege
[01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:07.420]   versus the cost of explaining to its own people
[01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:08.860]   that the war is lost.
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:12.460]   That country just might win, outlast.
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:14.100]   - Let's hope not,
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:19.100]   because the Ukrainians' resistance
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:21.260]   deserves to prevail here.
[01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:23.420]   Russia deserves to lose.
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:26.220]   No war of aggression like they've committed here
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:28.700]   against Ukraine should prevail
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:30.740]   if we can do anything about it.
[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:35.740]   I support 1,000% the continued supply of heavy weapons,
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:40.580]   including offensive weapons, to the Ukrainians,
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:42.660]   as long as they're willing to resist,
[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:44.460]   and it's their choice.
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:46.660]   It's their choice when to negotiate.
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:48.620]   It's their choice how much to resist.
[01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:51.380]   It's their choice what kind of sacrifices to make.
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:56.780]   And it's our responsibility to meet their requests
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:37:00.740]   more quickly than we have so far and at greater scale.
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:05.220]   But ultimately, wars only have political ends.
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:07.620]   They never have military ends.
[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:10.340]   You need a political solution here.
[01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:12.660]   So if the Ukrainians are able
[01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:17.860]   to conduct a successful counteroffensive at scale
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:23.580]   in July or August, whenever they launch,
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:26.540]   right now the heavy weapons are coming in
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.820]   and they're being moved to the battlefield
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:31.580]   and more are coming, you know the dynamic.
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:35.740]   Russia bombs a school, Russia bombs a hospital,
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:38.220]   Americans and Europeans decide to send
[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:40.540]   even more heavy weapons to Ukraine, right?
[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:43.860]   That's the self-defeating dynamic from the Russian side.
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:47.100]   They commit the atrocities, we send more heavy weapons.
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:51.780]   Once those heavy weapons are on the battle lines,
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:55.020]   we'll see if Ukrainians cannot just defend,
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:57.220]   which they've proven they're able to do
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:01.820]   in breathtaking fashion, not just conduct counterattacks
[01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:04.820]   where the enemy moves forward
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:07.860]   and you cut behind the enemy's lines
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:11.260]   and you counterattack and push the enemy back a little bit,
[01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:17.460]   but whether you can evict the Russians from your territory
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:20.500]   with a combined arms operation
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.980]   where you have a massive superiority
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:25.500]   in infantry and heavy weapons,
[01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:29.460]   but more importantly, you coordinate your air power,
[01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:33.940]   your tanks, your drones, your infantry at scale,
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:36.500]   which is something the Ukrainians have not done yet.
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:39.420]   It's something the Russians failed at in Ukraine
[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:42.940]   and they come from the same place, the Soviet military.
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:46.100]   We hope this Ukrainian counteroffensive at scale,
[01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:50.420]   this combined arms operation succeeds
[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:51.740]   and if it does succeed,
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:54.420]   there's the possibility of a battlefield victory.
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:57.500]   Whether that also includes Crimea,
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:02.020]   which as you know, is not hostile on the contrary
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:06.220]   to the Russian military remains to be seen,
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:11.740]   but however much they regain territorially
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:15.620]   back towards the 1991 borders,
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:18.100]   which is their goal, their stated goal
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:22.460]   and which we support them properly in trying to achieve,
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:26.020]   however much they achieve of that in this counteroffensive
[01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:27.380]   that we're anticipating,
[01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:31.100]   that will set the stage for the next phase
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:35.660]   and either Russia, which is to say one person,
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:40.660]   Vladimir Putin will acknowledge that he's lost the war
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:44.460]   because the Ukrainians won it on the battlefield
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:49.460]   or he'll try to announce a full-scale mobilization,
[01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:53.500]   conscript the whole country, go back
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.540]   and instead of acknowledging defeat,
[01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:58.620]   try to win with a different plan, recalibrate,
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:00.420]   remains to be seen.
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:04.020]   Will the Ukrainians negotiate any territory away
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:07.540]   or must they capture also Crimea,
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:12.540]   which puts a very high bar on the summer counteroffensive
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:15.420]   that we're gonna see, which could last through the fall
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:17.620]   and into the winter as a result.
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:18.980]   We don't know the answers to that,
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:21.060]   nobody knows the answers to that.
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:23.820]   People are guessing, some people are better informed
[01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:26.440]   'cause they have inside intelligence.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:32.660]   People are also worried about Russian escalation
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:34.940]   to nuclear weapons or chemical weapons
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:38.380]   if they begin to lose on the battlefield to Ukraine.
[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:40.740]   - Are you worried about nuclear war,
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:43.800]   the possibility of nuclear war?
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:47.300]   - I think it's necessary to pay attention
[01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:49.020]   to that possibility.
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:54.020]   That possibility existed before the February 2022
[01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:57.260]   full-blown invasion of Ukraine.
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:00.340]   The doomsday arsenal that Russia possesses
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:03.500]   is enough to destroy the world many times over
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:06.460]   and that's been the case every year
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:10.260]   since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
[01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:13.940]   And so of course we're concerned about that.
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:15.740]   We do know, however, Lex,
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:18.520]   that they have a system known as dual key.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:22.440]   Dual key for their strategic nuclear weapons.
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:27.020]   Strategic nuclear weapons means the ones
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:30.020]   fired from silos, the missiles,
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:32.340]   the ones delivered from bombers
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:34.460]   or the ones fired from submarines, right?
[01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:35.840]   - And they're ready to go.
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.720]   - They're intercontinental.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:40.500]   We watch that very, very closely.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.280]   We watch all the movement of that
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:44.440]   and the alerts, et cetera.
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:47.160]   We have tremendously, let's say,
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:51.120]   tremendous inside intelligence on that.
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:53.800]   But dual key means that President Putin alone
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:55.440]   cannot fire them.
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:57.840]   He has one key which he must insert.
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:02.840]   He must then insert the codes for a command to launch.
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:07.520]   That then goes to the head of the general staff
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:11.600]   who must, has his own key and separate codes
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:12.760]   and must do the same,
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:15.400]   insert that key and codes for them to launch.
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:21.120]   And so will the general staff chief go along
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:23.000]   with the destruction of the world
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.200]   over a battlefield loss in Ukraine?
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:27.840]   I don't know the answer to that
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.320]   and I don't know if anybody knows the answer to that.
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:33.420]   Will those people flying those bombers,
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:34.840]   if they get the order from,
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:38.000]   if the dual key system goes into action
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.000]   and both keys are used and all the codes are implemented,
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.720]   will those young guys flying those bombers
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:48.460]   let those bombs go?
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:53.380]   Will those at the missile silos decide to engage and fire?
[01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:56.160]   We don't know, but you can see that
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:59.300]   it's more than one man making the decision here
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:02.400]   in a system of strategic nuclear weapons.
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:05.840]   As far as the tactical, the so-called low yield
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:07.920]   or battlefield nuclear weapons,
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:11.360]   we're not sure the system that they have in Russia
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.560]   these days for their implement,
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:16.860]   for their use of such tactical nuclear weapons.
[01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:22.040]   It could well be that Putin and just himself,
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:26.500]   he alone can fire them or order them be fired.
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.080]   But you know, Lex,
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:32.720]   there's no tactical nuclear weapon fired at Ukraine
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:36.060]   that's not also fired simultaneously at Russia.
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:42.040]   If the Kremlin is 600 miles from Ukraine
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.120]   and if the wind changes direction
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:49.760]   or the wind happens to be blowing east, northeast,
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:54.520]   the fallout hits your Kremlin, not just Ukraine.
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:58.040]   Moreover, you have all those border regions
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:01.760]   which are staging regions for the Russian offensive.
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:04.160]   And they're a lot closer than 600 miles.
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.280]   They're actually right there.
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:09.560]   And so you fire that weapon on Ukrainian territory
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.040]   and you can get the fallout
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:16.200]   just like the Chernobyl fallout spread to Sweden,
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:20.480]   which is how we got the Kremlin to finally,
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:21.720]   first they denied, they said,
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:24.000]   "Oh, we don't know why there's a big nuclear cloud
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.200]   "over Sweden.
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:26.960]   "We don't know where that came from."
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.620]   And eventually they admitted it.
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:33.400]   So Russia can't actually use a nuclear weapon
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:35.840]   tactical battlefield, one in Ukraine,
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.960]   without also firing it at itself.
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:41.100]   And in addition, it's that same dynamic
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:42.960]   I alluded to earlier,
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:46.520]   which is to say you bomb a hospital,
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:48.420]   you bomb a school,
[01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:52.600]   there's more heavy weapons going to Ukraine from the West.
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.100]   - You can't get away with any of the,
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:56.520]   there's always going to be a response
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:59.160]   that's either proportional or greater than proportional.
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.840]   - You could well have Europe
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:05.200]   signing on to NATO direct engagement,
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:09.080]   both Washington and Brussels direct engagement
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:13.160]   of the Russian army on the territory of Ukraine.
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.060]   - You think that's possible to do that
[01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:19.320]   without dramatic escalation from the Russian side?
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:21.080]   - Yes, I do think it's possible,
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:24.240]   but it's very worrisome, just like you're saying.
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:28.280]   But if Putin were to escalate like that,
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.280]   he's firing that weapon at himself,
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:34.560]   and he's potentially provoking a direct clash
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:36.400]   with NATO's military,
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:39.240]   not just with the Ukrainian military.
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:40.800]   If you're sitting in the Kremlin
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:45.480]   looking at those charts, Lex, of NATO capabilities,
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:48.520]   and you can't conquer Ukraine,
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.400]   which didn't really have heavy weapons
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.360]   before February, 2022 at scale,
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:58.120]   and you're thinking, okay, now I'm going to take on NATO,
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:03.960]   that would be a bold step on the part of a Russian leader.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:06.240]   And let's also remember, Lex,
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:07.960]   that there's another variable here.
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:13.960]   You're a despot as long as everyone implements your orders.
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:20.440]   And so if people start to say quietly,
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.640]   not necessarily publicly,
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:24.920]   I may not implement that order,
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:27.320]   'cause that's maybe a criminal order.
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:32.320]   Or my grandma is Ukrainian, or my wife is Ukrainian,
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:35.580]   or I don't want to go to the Hague,
[01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:38.680]   I don't want to spend the rest of my life in the Hague,
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:40.320]   or whatever it might be.
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:43.280]   At any point along the chain of command,
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:48.280]   from the general staff all the way down to the platoon,
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:52.760]   you're a despot provided they implement your orders.
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:57.760]   But who's to say that somewhere along the chain of command,
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:02.920]   people start to say, I'm gonna ignore that order,
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:05.960]   or I'm gonna sabotage that order,
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:09.200]   or I'm gonna flee the battlefield,
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:13.160]   or I'm gonna injure myself so that I don't have to fight,
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:16.720]   or I'm gonna join the Ukrainian side.
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:19.720]   And so it could be that what's left
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:24.640]   of the Russian army in the field begins to disintegrate.
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:26.920]   Even if the Ukrainians are not able
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:29.560]   to mount that counteroffensive at scale,
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:31.660]   that combined arms operation,
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:34.840]   the Russian military in the field,
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:36.800]   which has taken horrendous casualties
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:38.160]   as far as we understand,
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:41.380]   something like a third of the original force,
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:45.720]   so you're talking about 50 to 60,000,
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:48.440]   that includes both dead and wounded
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:51.820]   to the point of being unable to return to the battlefield.
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:55.920]   Those are big numbers, those were a lot of families.
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:57.640]   A lot of families affected.
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:02.520]   Their sons, or their husbands, or their fathers
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:04.120]   are either missing in action,
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:07.000]   or the regime won't tell them that they're dead.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.600]   As you know from the sinking
[01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:13.620]   of that flagship Moskva, right, by the Ukrainians.
[01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:18.500]   And so a disintegration of the Russian military
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:21.820]   because there are orders that they either can't implement
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:26.820]   or don't wanna implement is also not excluded.
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:29.260]   And so you have these two big variables,
[01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:30.860]   the Ukrainian army in the field
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:35.340]   and its ability to move from defense to offense at scale,
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:37.340]   and we're gonna test that soon.
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:39.580]   And then the Russian ability in the field
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:44.580]   to hold together in a war of conquest and aggression
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:49.660]   where their conscripts, or they're fed dog food,
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:53.060]   or they don't have any weapons anymore
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:54.860]   because there's no resupply,
[01:48:54.860 --> 01:48:59.180]   and so the disintegration of the army can't be excluded.
[01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:02.820]   And then, of course, all bets are off on the Putin regime.
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:07.820]   More long-term, there are these technology export controls.
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:10.720]   We were talking about how the military industrial complex
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:12.140]   in Russia is dependent
[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:16.660]   on foreign component parts and software.
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:19.380]   And so if you have export controls
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:21.300]   and you have firms voluntarily,
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:24.180]   even when they don't fall under export controls,
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:25.820]   leaving Russian business,
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:28.860]   refusing to do business with Russia,
[01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:31.640]   and we see this not just in the civilian sector
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:35.300]   like with McDonald's or many other companies,
[01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:40.300]   we see this in the key areas like the oil industry
[01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:42.160]   with the executives fleeing,
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:45.580]   that is the Western executives fleeing,
[01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:47.940]   giving up their positions.
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:51.740]   So Russia's ability to resupply its tanks,
[01:49:51.740 --> 01:49:56.740]   resupply its missiles, resupply its uniforms,
[01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:01.960]   resupply its food to its soldiers in the field,
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:03.640]   and their boots.
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:07.880]   We see a lot of stuff under tremendous stress,
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:11.220]   and in the long-term, there's no obvious way
[01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:14.880]   they can rebuild the military industrial complex
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:17.840]   to produce those weapons
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:20.100]   because they're reliant on foreign parts
[01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:21.360]   that they can't get anymore,
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.960]   and there are no domestic substitutes
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:26.240]   on the immediate horizon.
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:30.660]   That's at the earliest a two-year proposition
[01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:32.360]   to have domestic substitutes,
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:35.420]   and for some things like microelectronics,
[01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:37.380]   they've never had domestic substitutes
[01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:40.740]   going back to the Soviet times, as you know well.
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:43.980]   And so there's that pressure on Russia
[01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:46.820]   from the technology export controls,
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:49.820]   which if you're in the security ministry
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:51.140]   or the defense ministry,
[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:54.420]   if you're in that side of the regime,
[01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:57.000]   you're feeling that pain as we speak,
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.060]   and you're wondering about the strategy.
[01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:06.500]   - Let me ask you about, again, the echoes of history,
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:10.460]   and it frustrates me in part when people draw these parallels
[01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:14.160]   but maybe there is some deep insight about those parallels.
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:19.160]   So there's a song that goes,
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:23.140]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:27.740]   So in Operation Barbarossa,
[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:30.840]   the bombing of Kiev by Hitler,
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:34.360]   there is sort of an eerie parallel,
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:37.300]   and you have to be extremely careful
[01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:41.980]   drawing such parallels and such connections
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:46.980]   to this unexplainable war that is World War II.
[01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:55.300]   But is there elements of this
[01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:58.780]   that do echo in the actions of Vladimir Putin?
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:01.820]   And more specifically,
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:04.900]   do you think that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal?
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:09.500]   Can that label be assigned to the actions of this man?
[01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:14.580]   - A war criminal is a legal determination,
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:17.820]   and it requires evidence and due process
[01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:20.200]   and the ability to defend oneself.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:24.860]   We don't just decide in the Twittersphere
[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:27.660]   or on a podcast that somebody is a war criminal.
[01:52:27.660 --> 01:52:31.700]   They can be a suspected war criminal,
[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:35.980]   and we can gather evidence to try to prosecute that case.
[01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:38.420]   And then the issue for us, Lex,
[01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:40.680]   is which court does it go to?
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:44.100]   What's the appropriate place?
[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:46.700]   Does it happen in Ukraine because they're the victims?
[01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:47.940]   Does it happen in The Hague
[01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:51.140]   because there's an international criminal court there?
[01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:52.900]   Does it happen inside Russia
[01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:55.980]   because there's regime change at some point,
[01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:59.260]   and some of these people become,
[01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:02.780]   let's say they get arrested by their own people
[01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:03.700]   inside Russia?
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:07.100]   So those are all important questions
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:09.520]   that have to be pursued with resources
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:13.740]   and with determination and by skilled people
[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:17.060]   who are excellent at gathering that evidence.
[01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:18.940]   And that process is underway.
[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:22.100]   And Ukraine has a trial underway now
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:26.620]   of one alleged war criminal who's pleaded guilty,
[01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:29.580]   and we'll see what the outcome of that trial
[01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:32.100]   inside Ukraine is of a lower-level official,
[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:35.020]   not obviously Vladimir Putin,
[01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:36.940]   but the commander of a tank group.
[01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:43.940]   So yes, the names are eerily familiar.
[01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:51.500]   Izum, Kharkiv, Kiev, right?
[01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:56.740]   Those are the names we know from the Nazi invasion
[01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:59.560]   and the Nazi occupation of Ukraine.
[01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:03.980]   And it's very deeply troubling
[01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:06.040]   to think that this could happen again.
[01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:11.420]   And there's a bizarre sense that the Russians,
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:15.620]   claiming, as Putin says, to denazify Ukraine,
[01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:20.100]   have invaded the same places that the Nazis invaded
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:21.940]   back in 1941.
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:24.580]   - As somebody who's working on volume three
[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:30.500]   of your work on Stalin, going through this period,
[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:32.220]   is it eerie to you?
[01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:33.540]   - Yes, it is, Lex.
[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:34.660]   - That you're--
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:37.580]   - I've written the chapters of volume three.
[01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:39.720]   I've drafted the chapters on the war.
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:43.660]   And as I said, the place names
[01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:45.900]   are very evocative, unfortunately.
[01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:50.860]   But you know, the Nazis failed, ultimately.
[01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:57.260]   They captured Ukraine for a time,
[01:54:57.260 --> 01:55:00.460]   but they were evicted from Ukraine.
[01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:03.540]   And there was massive partisan
[01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:07.020]   or guerrilla warfare resistance behind Nazi lines
[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:10.740]   the whole time that they were, allegedly,
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:13.020]   in control of Ukraine.
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:15.220]   If you look at the maps on cable TV,
[01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:17.220]   they show you the sign of Russia,
[01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:19.900]   they show you the coloring, Russian control.
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:22.380]   And they draw a line and then it's colored in.
[01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:24.680]   But the word control is misplaced.
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:27.140]   They don't actually control it.
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:30.380]   It's Russian claimed or extent
[01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:34.660]   of farthest Russian troop advancement.
[01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:37.540]   Because behind the Russian lines in Ukraine,
[01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:40.980]   Crimea accepted, you have insurgencies.
[01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:43.380]   You have the armed insurgency.
[01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:46.340]   In Melitopol, for example, which is a place
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:49.220]   that you know, in southeastern Ukraine,
[01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:53.480]   there is a guerrilla war now underway
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:57.880]   to hurt the Russians who are in occupation
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:55:59.280]   of that city and region.
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:02.760]   And we're gonna see that continue,
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:06.580]   even if the war becomes a stalemate,
[01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:09.720]   even if it stalemates more or less
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:11.920]   at the lines we're at now,
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:16.080]   which would mean that anticipated Ukrainian
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:19.460]   counteroffensive at scale proves unsuccessful,
[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:21.920]   the Russian army doesn't disintegrate,
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:25.760]   and you end up with a stalemate
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:28.400]   where there could be a ceasefire, not a ceasefire,
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.600]   but neither side is attempting an offensive
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:32.480]   for the time being.
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:36.320]   There will be resistance behind those Russian lines,
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:38.720]   and it will be fierce resistance,
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:42.240]   the kind of resistance we saw to the Nazi occupation.
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:48.080]   Ultimately, it took the Red Army re-invading
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:52.440]   the territory of Ukraine and succeeding
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:56.160]   at combined arms operations at scale.
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:58.760]   A massive counteroffensive, much larger
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:01.200]   than anything we're talking about today.
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:03.360]   Ultimately, it required that to evict
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:05.560]   the Nazis from Ukraine.
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:07.480]   But in the meantime, they did not have
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:09.740]   an easy occupation regime there.
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:16.720]   Ukrainian partisans, Soviet partisans,
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:21.400]   killed Nazi officials, Wehrmacht soldiers,
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:26.400]   Wehrmacht officers, blew up the infrastructure
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:29.680]   they were using, made them pay a price
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:30.920]   for their occupation.
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.480]   We could well see if unfortunately this ends
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:38.160]   in a stalemate for the time being,
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:41.360]   we could well see that type of insurgency
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:44.760]   gain momentum behind Russian lines,
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:48.100]   and try to evict the Russians that way,
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:52.560]   and then remount the counteroffensive at scale
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:57.480]   later on in the future, if the first one doesn't succeed.
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:00.960]   So that would be further echoes
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:03.000]   of the World War II experience.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.840]   The scale once again is much smaller.
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:10.200]   The size of the armies here, they're not in the many
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:15.200]   800,000, 700,000, a million two, a million four,
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:18.040]   that's not what we're talking about today.
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:21.340]   But the weapons, the cruise missiles,
[01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:27.320]   artillery fire, artillery fire used to be very inaccurate,
[01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:29.400]   and it was like saturation.
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:31.880]   You would just fire towards the enemy lines,
[01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:33.520]   and if you hit something, you hit something,
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:36.020]   and if you didn't, you just kept firing.
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:39.560]   Now you have drones, Lex.
[01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:43.060]   And so artillery fire is now sniper fire,
[01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:46.000]   'cause you can coordinate the direction
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.520]   of the artillery fire with the drones.
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:52.240]   The drones can take a picture and show you
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:55.400]   where the enemy is precisely located,
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:58.840]   and you can align that artillery to hit them
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:02.200]   instead of just indiscriminately bombing an area,
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:06.680]   a territory, and the NATO-supplied artillery
[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:11.540]   goes really far, and you can fire into Russian positions
[01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:15.200]   and yourself not be exposed to Russian fire,
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:20.200]   because your artillery fires farther than theirs.
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:24.640]   So that's coming, and we're gonna see that in action.
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:28.560]   And so the scale is not the same, but the weapons,
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:31.640]   the precision of some of the weapons and some of the NATO,
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:34.000]   we're not sending all of our stuff,
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.480]   but as I said, the dynamic is Russia commits atrocities,
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:40.240]   Russia bombs schools, Russia bombs hospitals,
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:44.840]   Russia kills civilians, and more and heavier
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:48.960]   and more lethal Western weapons go to Ukraine.
[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:51.600]   Their willingness to risk their lives
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:55.800]   is really so impressive, and the reason that we,
[01:59:55.800 --> 02:00:00.800]   it's our duty, we're obliged to supply those weapons.
[02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:03.560]   And so the Russians don't have that resupply,
[02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:05.000]   and the Ukrainians do.
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.260]   And so the Russians are now digging in, Lex.
[02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:12.020]   They're digging in deeply in the areas
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:15.520]   that they've penetrated, and they're trying to build
[02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:20.520]   unassailable positions for when the Ukrainians transition
[02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:26.440]   from mostly defense to full-scale offense.
[02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:30.520]   And we'll see if that, I mean, they're digging everywhere.
[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:34.720]   As they say, (speaking in foreign language)
[02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:36.400]   They're digging everywhere behind.
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:37.680]   - Your Russian is beautiful.
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:41.160]   - Digging in, I wish, Lex, like yours.
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:44.700]   But so there are these things that we can't predict,
[02:00:44.700 --> 02:00:46.300]   but there are these things we're watching
[02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:47.600]   and watching closely.
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:53.380]   - And on top of that, something that's not in World War II,
[02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:56.260]   or for the most part, is cyber attacks and cyber warfare,
[02:00:56.260 --> 02:01:00.480]   which is much less, perhaps,
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:06.220]   convertible into human words, because it happens
[02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:08.280]   so quickly, it's such large scales,
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:10.440]   so difficult to trace, and all those kinds of things.
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:14.660]   It's not bullets, it's electrical signals.
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:18.460]   - Yeah, but those Ukrainian people, they're like you, Lex.
[02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:23.040]   They're young, and they're technically really proficient.
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:24.980]   And they've been amazing.
[02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:28.460]   You know, they spent those teenage years in the basement
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:30.540]   playing video games.
[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:32.740]   - Turns out it's useful after all.
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:35.060]   - It turns out it's more than useful.
[02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:37.580]   You can save your country that way.
[02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:39.360]   And so they're not alone.
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:43.440]   They're getting support, and that support is important.
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:46.280]   But really, predominantly, it's Ukrainians
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:49.200]   on the cyber battlefield, and their skills
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:51.480]   have been very impressive, and they've been preparing
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:53.320]   for this for a number of years.
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:56.840]   And they have a whole army of young people
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:58.560]   on the cyber side.
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:00.360]   It's their civilian population.
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:02.800]   These are not people conscripted into the military
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:05.960]   or volunteering, wearing the uniform.
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:08.780]   And so even in cyber warfare, the Ukrainians
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:11.500]   have been extremely impressive.
[02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:16.500]   And so let's remember that all of these aspects of warfare,
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:22.900]   whether it's how far your cruise missiles go
[02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:25.700]   and how accurate they are, what size
[02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:30.620]   your cyber capabilities are, it's really ultimately
[02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:31.940]   about the people.
[02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:34.660]   It's about the human capital, right?
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:39.540]   It's about their willingness, their skill level,
[02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:41.600]   but also their willingness to fight
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:43.580]   and to put their lives on the line.
[02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:45.820]   And there's no substitute for that.
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:49.180]   And so what's called morale, or courage,
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:54.180]   or bravery, or valor, that's really the ultimately decisive,
[02:02:54.180 --> 02:02:57.920]   provided you have enough sufficient arms
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:01.200]   to conduct the fight.
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:04.600]   And if you don't, you use a Molotov cocktail, right?
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:08.580]   Grandma calls in the coordinates of the Russian tank
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:13.580]   on her iPhone, and you have a Molotov cocktail
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:18.780]   that the people who used to work in the cafeteria
[02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:22.180]   are now stuffing flammable liquid into bottles,
[02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:23.940]   and you carry one right up to the tank
[02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:25.480]   and you smash it against the tank,
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:29.460]   or you drop it in one of the hatches in the tank, right?
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:33.140]   There's no substitute for that kind of stuff,
[02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:35.760]   that level of resolve,
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:38.200]   willingness to die for your country.
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.360]   That's a really big lesson
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:43.700]   that we need to absorb in our own country.
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:48.260]   We've been going to war more frequently than we should,
[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:51.640]   and like you said, without the justification all the time,
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:53.900]   and then like Henry Kissinger said,
[02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:57.060]   without understanding how this was gonna end.
[02:03:57.060 --> 02:04:00.960]   It's easy to start a war, it's very difficult to win a war,
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:03.400]   prevail in a war, end a war on terms
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:07.620]   that meet your original expectations, right?
[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:10.000]   We've been fighting wars,
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.740]   but we haven't been fighting wars as societies.
[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:15.100]   We've been fighting wars
[02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:18.460]   as a small sliver of our population.
[02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:21.020]   Something like 1% of our population
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:22.460]   is involved with the military
[02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:24.920]   because we have an all-volunteer force.
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:29.020]   And that means that it's easier for our politicians
[02:04:29.020 --> 02:04:34.020]   to go to war because they don't face conscription,
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:36.500]   they don't have the draft,
[02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:39.620]   which affects every family in the country,
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:44.620]   and because the number of people in the volunteer force
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:49.560]   is such a narrow stratum of the population.
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:51.980]   And so they've been getting away with this
[02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:53.700]   because the professional army
[02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:56.140]   is much better than the conscript army,
[02:04:56.140 --> 02:04:58.980]   and an all-volunteer force is much preferable
[02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:01.220]   from a military point of view.
[02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:03.380]   But from a societal point of view,
[02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:09.340]   it enables you to go to war too easily as a politician,
[02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:11.720]   and it doesn't engage the society
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:14.180]   the same way that the Ukrainian society
[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:18.340]   is completely engaged from those young hackers
[02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:20.820]   all the way up to those grandmothers.
[02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:23.380]   - Let me ask you, you're a scholar of history,
[02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:25.160]   a scholar of geopolitics,
[02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:30.140]   and you're also a human being.
[02:05:30.140 --> 02:05:31.780]   - That's kind of you, Lex.
[02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:32.620]   I'll take that.
[02:05:32.620 --> 02:05:36.620]   - What's the value, what's the hope,
[02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:39.660]   what's the power of conversation here?
[02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:41.860]   If you could sit down with Vladimir Putin
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:46.860]   and have a conversation versus bullets,
[02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:51.160]   human exchange words, is there hope for those?
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:53.140]   And if so, what would you talk about?
[02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:54.300]   What would you ask him?
[02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:58.820]   - Well, Henry Kissinger, you alluded to his op-ed.
[02:05:58.820 --> 02:06:01.620]   He's had many private meetings with President Putin
[02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:05.380]   over a long time.
[02:06:05.380 --> 02:06:13.460]   President Biden, the previous presidents,
[02:06:13.460 --> 02:06:18.460]   secretaries of state, officials below secretary of state,
[02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:20.860]   the head of the CIA,
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:24.580]   evidently met with President Putin in the fall
[02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:27.940]   when he was massing the troops on the border
[02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:29.260]   before he invaded.
[02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:34.040]   And we sent the head of the CIA and Putin received him.
[02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:36.980]   Somebody he evidently respects
[02:06:36.980 --> 02:06:39.220]   or was at least willing to meet,
[02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:41.420]   unlike other members of the administration.
[02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:45.080]   So a lot of people are talking to him
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:48.700]   in some form or another for the 22 years
[02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:49.820]   he's been in power.
[02:06:51.460 --> 02:06:55.300]   And I'm not sure it's had what I would call
[02:06:55.300 --> 02:06:57.380]   their desired effect.
[02:06:57.380 --> 02:07:00.020]   - Well, the nature of the conversation is interesting too,
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:03.660]   and also the timing, which is post-February 22nd,
[02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:05.340]   is a different time.
[02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:07.460]   And also another aspect,
[02:07:07.460 --> 02:07:12.660]   which Oliver Stone mentioned, interestingly,
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:15.940]   that there's something about COVID and the pandemic
[02:07:15.940 --> 02:07:18.540]   that creates isolation, the distancing.
[02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:21.660]   It's such a silly little nuanced thing,
[02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:25.740]   but maybe it's actually has a profound impact
[02:07:25.740 --> 02:07:29.180]   on the human being, the human mind of Vladimir Putin,
[02:07:29.180 --> 02:07:32.140]   that there is something about an in-person meeting
[02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:35.540]   and not across a table that's far too large,
[02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:38.860]   but sort of the intimacy of a one human-to-human
[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:40.460]   in-person conversation,
[02:07:40.460 --> 02:07:43.820]   that there's something distinctly powerful
[02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:45.860]   about that reminder there,
[02:07:45.860 --> 02:07:50.020]   that as Putin says in the narrative, in the propaganda,
[02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:52.180]   that we're all one people.
[02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:53.980]   There is truth to that,
[02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:57.220]   that this entirety of humanity is one people.
[02:07:57.220 --> 02:07:59.580]   And you're kind of reminded by that
[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:01.140]   when you're sitting together.
[02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:06.420]   - People who have sat across the table from him,
[02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:10.340]   whether at 30 yards or at three,
[02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:15.660]   have remarked upon this feeling of isolation
[02:08:15.660 --> 02:08:18.860]   that has affected him, the pandemic.
[02:08:18.860 --> 02:08:21.140]   I think there must be something to that
[02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:25.020]   if several people who've been in the room with him
[02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:26.180]   are remarking on it.
[02:08:26.180 --> 02:08:31.140]   Everybody that I know and I've been able to talk to
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:34.140]   who's had a meeting with him in the past 10 years,
[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:39.460]   including Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State,
[02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:44.940]   has said that Putin spends a lot of time
[02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:47.980]   enumerating his grievances.
[02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:52.980]   He goes through a monologue of his grievances.
[02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:54.620]   And then the West did this,
[02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:57.500]   and then the West lied to us about that.
[02:08:57.500 --> 02:09:00.940]   And then the West cheated us on this.
[02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:03.660]   And so it's not the conversation
[02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:06.860]   that you're encouraging of common humanity.
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:10.820]   It's that roiling resentment volcano
[02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:13.100]   that's just exploding and exploding.
[02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:14.380]   - The resentment.
[02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:17.820]   - And by the time he gets through
[02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:21.220]   the monologue of the grievances,
[02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:25.340]   the time of the meeting is expired or over time.
[02:09:25.340 --> 02:09:26.780]   - That's a brilliant statement,
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:29.500]   but that's where the skill of conversation comes in.
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:32.820]   Like when you're facing a bull with a red cloth,
[02:09:32.820 --> 02:09:35.420]   you have to learn how to avoid the long list of grievances
[02:09:35.420 --> 02:09:37.300]   and get to the humanity.
[02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:38.740]   That's a really important skill.
[02:09:38.740 --> 02:09:39.580]   - It's a skill.
[02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:40.860]   For sure it's a skill,
[02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:44.060]   and it's the highest level skill of a diplomat
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:47.700]   to be able to reach some type of common understanding
[02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:51.540]   when interests and worldviews clash so much.
[02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:53.540]   But here's your challenge, Lex.
[02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:59.780]   Your challenge is Russia wants to impose
[02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:05.220]   a closed sphere of influence on its neighbors.
[02:10:05.220 --> 02:10:10.420]   It wants to dictate what its neighbors can and can't do.
[02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:12.840]   It wants to exert influence,
[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:15.100]   not by the power of its example,
[02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:18.300]   not by the freedom of its people,
[02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:22.380]   not by the dynamism of its diversified economy,
[02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:24.700]   but it wants to exert influence
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:27.300]   just because it deserves that,
[02:10:27.300 --> 02:10:30.180]   just because it's a great power,
[02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:33.300]   just because, and on and on and on.
[02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:36.100]   It's a civilization unto itself.
[02:10:36.100 --> 02:10:39.040]   And it wants that, and we can't give that.
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:44.620]   The reason that Russia was not integrated into the West
[02:10:44.620 --> 02:10:46.060]   was not for lack of trying.
[02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:51.860]   It was because Russia ultimately spurned the integration
[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:54.160]   because it was about what terms
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:56.500]   the integration would come on.
[02:10:56.500 --> 02:11:00.100]   Would you come into the West and observe Western rules
[02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:06.060]   and be another country, meaning just another country?
[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:10.620]   There's Poland and there's Austria,
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:15.620]   and there's little tiny Monaco, and there's Russia.
[02:11:15.620 --> 02:11:19.500]   And you're just one of those countries.
[02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:21.920]   And Russia's answer to that was no,
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:24.420]   we're not just one of those countries.
[02:11:24.420 --> 02:11:26.660]   We need special rules.
[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:29.400]   We need special conditions.
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:33.420]   We'll integrate, but only as a special country,
[02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:38.420]   meaning like at the UN, where all countries are sovereign,
[02:11:38.580 --> 02:11:42.340]   all countries are members, but Russia has a veto
[02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:44.860]   on what countries can and can't do.
[02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:48.860]   Those were the terms on which they were willing to integrate.
[02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:51.060]   And those were the terms that no leader
[02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:54.000]   of a Western country or the United States,
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:58.080]   or the G7, or fill in the blank, can grant to Russia.
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:03.820]   It's very well known that Vladimir Putin
[02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:06.460]   was one of the first, maybe the first person,
[02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:10.420]   first leader, foreign leader, to call President Bush
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:13.420]   after the 9/11 tragedy.
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:15.420]   They didn't connect right away.
[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:17.860]   President Bush was not in Washington,
[02:12:17.860 --> 02:12:20.300]   but eventually they did speak.
[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:22.040]   He condemned the terrorist attack.
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:26.420]   He offered Russian support, which he delivered on,
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:28.580]   the use of some Russian logistics
[02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:32.220]   for our Afghanistan operations.
[02:12:32.220 --> 02:12:34.820]   And a lot of people point to that,
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:36.500]   and they say, there it is.
[02:12:36.500 --> 02:12:41.500]   Russia wanted to cooperate, and did cooperate,
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:45.780]   and we spurned them, or we failed to appreciate
[02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:47.580]   Russia's cooperation.
[02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:50.020]   And so therefore, Russia was cheated,
[02:12:50.020 --> 02:12:53.540]   or Russia was lied to, or Russia's grievances are legitimate.
[02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:57.020]   But here's the problem with that argument, Lex.
[02:12:57.020 --> 02:13:01.660]   In exchange for that support, Vladimir Putin
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:05.040]   asked in return from President Bush
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:09.280]   for a free hand in the former Soviet space,
[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:13.280]   that closed hierarchical sphere of influence,
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:17.440]   where Russia would exert influence coercively
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:19.180]   over countries that were sovereign.
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:23.480]   And no American president could grant that,
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:25.000]   and President Bush was right.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:25.920]   He said no.
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:30.840]   And so the attempted cooperation blew up.
[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:33.280]   But who's at fault there?
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:40.720]   Should there be a non-voluntary sphere of influence?
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:41.960]   Should that be granted?
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:46.800]   Or should you face up to attempts to do that?
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:52.460]   Let's take a little detour here into China for a second.
[02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:56.680]   China had this brilliant grand strategy,
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:01.760]   which was, sure, America is hostile,
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:03.580]   because America is hegemonic,
[02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:05.800]   America wants to control the world,
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:07.840]   America will never let China rise,
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:11.420]   America will do everything it can to hold China down.
[02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:14.960]   So we're gonna have hostility from America.
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:16.780]   We don't wanna decouple,
[02:14:16.780 --> 02:14:20.520]   because we need that high-end technology transfer.
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:22.280]   Either we buy it or we steal it,
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:24.160]   'cause America and the rest of the West
[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:26.660]   has all the technology that we need.
[02:14:26.660 --> 02:14:29.120]   We have some of it domestically,
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:31.120]   more than before by a lot,
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:33.960]   but we're still dependent, so we can't decouple.
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.640]   So we'll have the hostility,
[02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:37.480]   but there'll be a line we don't cross,
[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:40.160]   just so that we don't lose the technology transfer.
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:45.660]   Till made in China 2035 is accomplished,
[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:48.440]   and we're self-sufficient domestically,
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:51.000]   and AI in every other area that's critical.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.940]   But hostility from America.
[02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:55.900]   But we have an ace in the hole.
[02:14:55.900 --> 02:14:58.120]   Our ace in the hole is Europe.
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:00.160]   Europe hates conflict.
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:01.600]   They're all about trade.
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:04.760]   It doesn't matter how evil you are.
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:05.720]   They love to trade,
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:10.600]   because van der door handel, change through trade.
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:11.720]   They have this illusion
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:14.360]   that you're gonna become a better country
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:15.560]   if they trade with you,
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:18.040]   and you won't have conflict, war, and hostilities
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:19.520]   if you trade.
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:22.480]   And so we have this European ace in the hole.
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:24.320]   We're hostile with the Americans.
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:27.880]   We're still buying or stealing their technology.
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:29.680]   And better than that even,
[02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:32.680]   the Europeans are not hostile to us at all.
[02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:33.800]   They love to trade with us,
[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:35.160]   and they wanna trade more,
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:38.240]   and they're our biggest trading partner already.
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:39.200]   And lo and behold,
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:41.760]   Xi Jinping sides with Vladimir Putin
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:44.280]   in the aggression in Ukraine.
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:49.440]   He doesn't side with him providing military equipment.
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:51.960]   He doesn't provide technology transfer,
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:55.640]   but he provides public support
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:58.080]   and massive pro-Russian propaganda
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:15:59.960]   to the whole Chinese population.
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:04.320]   And the Europeans say, wait a minute.
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:07.640]   This is an invasion of a sovereign country in Europe.
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:08.660]   What do you mean?
[02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:12.960]   You're not condemning Vladimir Putin's invasion.
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:15.720]   And so that wedge that the Chinese had
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:18.400]   that was the basis of their grand strategy,
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:21.120]   that wedge between the US and Europe
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:23.080]   when it came to China policy,
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:24.880]   that wedge is gone now.
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:27.280]   Xi Jinping destroyed it.
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:29.240]   And the Europeans and the Americans
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:31.400]   are coming close together
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:34.800]   on Ukraine and Russia policy for sure,
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:37.500]   but also more and more on China policy.
[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:40.800]   And so that was a pretty big sacrifice
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:42.800]   for the Chinese leader to make.
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:44.320]   And what did he get in return?
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:50.040]   He gets hydrocarbons from Russia at reduced prices.
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:53.720]   And the Chinese get hydrocarbons from a lot of countries.
[02:16:54.620 --> 02:16:58.740]   They have a completely diverse supply chain
[02:16:58.740 --> 02:16:59.700]   for their energy.
[02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:02.220]   - So what do you think Xi Jinping is thinking now?
[02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:04.620]   Was it a mistake?
[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:06.220]   - I'd like to know, Lex.
[02:17:06.220 --> 02:17:08.660]   I'd like you to be able to sit down with him
[02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:11.740]   across from this table here on your podcast
[02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:13.460]   and pose that same question to him
[02:17:13.460 --> 02:17:14.860]   because we have no idea.
[02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:16.800]   - There's a language barrier that's fascinating.
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:20.180]   By the way, you as a scholar of Stalin,
[02:17:20.180 --> 02:17:21.660]   do you think we'll ever break through
[02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:24.140]   the language barrier to China?
[02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:25.620]   Not ever, I apologize.
[02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:29.260]   In the next few years because there is a gigantic
[02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:30.900]   cultural and language barrier
[02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:32.580]   between the West and the Chinese.
[02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:34.540]   - China's a great civilization.
[02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:39.540]   China predates the United States by millennia.
[02:17:39.540 --> 02:17:42.580]   China's accomplishments are breathtaking.
[02:17:42.580 --> 02:17:46.260]   But China's also led by, let's be honest,
[02:17:46.260 --> 02:17:48.460]   a Communist Party monopoly
[02:17:49.820 --> 02:17:53.020]   which engages in a lot of criminal behavior.
[02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:56.260]   Lex, Tibet is Ukraine.
[02:17:56.260 --> 02:17:59.820]   Xinjiang is Ukraine.
[02:17:59.820 --> 02:18:03.340]   Hong Kong is Ukraine.
[02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:07.300]   Let alone support for Putin.
[02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:09.580]   This is before we've even discussed Taiwan.
[02:18:09.580 --> 02:18:13.260]   And so now the Europeans are coming to see this
[02:18:13.260 --> 02:18:16.360]   and the Americans are coming to understand this
[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:20.100]   that maybe trading with a regime like that,
[02:18:20.100 --> 02:18:25.560]   morally, politically, criminally,
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:28.700]   Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong,
[02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:31.960]   how is that different from what Putin is doing in Ukraine?
[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:35.760]   I'd be hard-pressed to differentiate that ultimately
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:38.880]   even though the analogies are not exact.
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:43.880]   And so the Chinese, it's like that guy Leonov,
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:48.880]   the author of "Li Xaletia," the great memoir
[02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:52.720]   of the late Soviet period, the end of the Soviet Union.
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:55.160]   You know that they spend all this time
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:58.160]   and all these resources blackening our image
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:00.480]   but we supply them with endless material
[02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:02.340]   to blacken our image.
[02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:05.720]   That's where Xi Jinping's regime is right now, Lex.
[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:09.600]   And so they have a big dilemma on their side.
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:14.280]   It's a Western world and they've united the Western world
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:19.280]   and reawoken the Western world to the fact
[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:25.380]   that China is a threat to the values,
[02:19:25.380 --> 02:19:27.680]   the institutions and values of the West.
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:31.120]   And that trade is not transforming China quite the opposite.
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:34.080]   We'll see if this endures.
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:36.940]   Maybe it doesn't endure, maybe it's a fleeting moment,
[02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:39.600]   maybe this is not an inflection point.
[02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:43.840]   Maybe the war in Ukraine ends more quickly than we think.
[02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:47.160]   And maybe like you said, the Chinese and the Indians
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:49.020]   and the rest of them, the leaders there,
[02:19:49.020 --> 02:19:53.480]   they get their wish that it ends and the world moves on
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:57.760]   and forgets or says, let's try again
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:01.740]   to resume our mutual understanding,
[02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:04.880]   our mutually beneficial trade and everything else.
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:07.420]   Maybe it's a passing phase, we can't exclude that.
[02:20:07.420 --> 02:20:09.700]   I'm very poor at predicting the future.
[02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:14.820]   But the moment is not a good one for the Chinese regime,
[02:20:14.820 --> 02:20:18.560]   let alone the fact that he's trying to impose
[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:22.280]   an unprecedented in the modern era,
[02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:25.380]   third term for himself as president
[02:20:25.380 --> 02:20:28.420]   in the fall at the next party Congress,
[02:20:28.420 --> 02:20:33.420]   becoming president for life, de facto, a Mao-like figure.
[02:20:34.420 --> 02:20:39.420]   And he's now got to do that within this environment
[02:20:39.420 --> 02:20:45.160]   where he has damaged Chinese grand strategy
[02:20:45.160 --> 02:20:47.720]   and damaged the reputation of China
[02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:51.040]   and its relationships across the world.
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:53.820]   Maybe not permanently, but significantly.
[02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:57.180]   In addition to the problems they have at home,
[02:20:57.180 --> 02:21:02.180]   demography, as you know, a middle income trap,
[02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:07.320]   and then the regulatory insanity of Chinese communist rule
[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:10.800]   that we've seen with the tech companies that you know well,
[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:12.980]   where they've destroyed all of that value,
[02:21:12.980 --> 02:21:17.180]   with the blow up of their property sector,
[02:21:17.180 --> 02:21:22.000]   because it was a massive bubble and that's still playing out.
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.200]   And this time it's the same,
[02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:27.080]   meaning this time it's not different.
[02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:29.080]   When it comes to a property blowout,
[02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:33.260]   it has enormous effects on middle class balance sheets
[02:21:33.260 --> 02:21:37.620]   and their ability to remain consumers
[02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:38.860]   and drive the economy,
[02:21:38.860 --> 02:21:40.980]   which is the model that they have to share.
[02:21:40.980 --> 02:21:43.860]   So he's got a litany of challenges,
[02:21:43.860 --> 02:21:48.220]   independent even of the fact that he sided
[02:21:48.220 --> 02:21:51.700]   with his pal, Vladimir Putin,
[02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:54.340]   and their bromance is costing China
[02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:56.060]   very, very significantly.
[02:21:56.060 --> 02:21:58.780]   - If you close your eyes.
[02:21:58.780 --> 02:22:00.020]   - Yes.
[02:22:00.020 --> 02:22:05.020]   - And 100 years ago, 1922, and you think about the future,
[02:22:05.020 --> 02:22:08.440]   I wonder if you can hear the drums of war,
[02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:15.060]   predicting the 30s, predicting the Great Depression
[02:22:15.060 --> 02:22:20.300]   and the resentment that builds, the economic resentment,
[02:22:20.300 --> 02:22:22.820]   the cultural resentment, the geopolitical resentment
[02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:25.020]   that builds and leads to World War II.
[02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:28.900]   It, at least to me, when I close my eyes,
[02:22:28.900 --> 02:22:33.340]   I can hear the drums of war that are still ahead of us.
[02:22:33.340 --> 02:22:36.940]   And it's possible that we're,
[02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:41.940]   there, 2022 will materialize in a similar way as did 1922.
[02:22:41.940 --> 02:22:46.980]   - I have my eyes closed, Lex.
[02:22:46.980 --> 02:22:48.060]   - Do you hear anything?
[02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:51.860]   - And I sure hope that that's not what happens.
[02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:54.380]   But I'm looking in 1922.
[02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:56.740]   It's an epoch I know well.
[02:22:56.740 --> 02:23:00.200]   And I don't see the future that unfolds.
[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:02.960]   I would not have predicted it had I been alive then.
[02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:07.580]   I see the war behind us.
[02:23:07.580 --> 02:23:10.980]   I see prosperity on the horizon.
[02:23:10.980 --> 02:23:14.820]   Yes, inflation in Germany and some many other
[02:23:14.820 --> 02:23:19.320]   difficult issues, but there are more democracies now
[02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:20.720]   than there were before the war,
[02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:23.180]   and the old empires are gone.
[02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:25.380]   And there's a cultural efflorescence,
[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:27.220]   and there's modernism in the arts,
[02:23:27.220 --> 02:23:30.360]   and there's women entering the public sphere,
[02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:32.660]   and there's all this fantastic new technology
[02:23:32.660 --> 02:23:33.820]   like automobiles.
[02:23:33.820 --> 02:23:38.380]   And I'm looking at the future from 1922,
[02:23:38.380 --> 02:23:40.700]   and I'm not seeing the Great Depression,
[02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:42.260]   and I'm not seeing World War II,
[02:23:42.260 --> 02:23:44.580]   and I'm not seeing the Holocaust,
[02:23:44.580 --> 02:23:48.020]   because I don't predict the future.
[02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:51.140]   And nobody in 1922 could see that future,
[02:23:51.140 --> 02:23:54.220]   although I guess there were some clairvoyants
[02:23:54.220 --> 02:23:56.260]   who predicted it, but--
[02:23:56.260 --> 02:23:57.660]   - But you're not one of them.
[02:23:57.660 --> 02:23:59.540]   - I'm not one of them,
[02:23:59.540 --> 02:24:03.380]   but this is what I know, Lex, from studying history.
[02:24:03.380 --> 02:24:05.480]   What I know is stuff happens.
[02:24:05.480 --> 02:24:07.100]   (laughing)
[02:24:07.100 --> 02:24:07.940]   In other words--
[02:24:07.940 --> 02:24:09.300]   - Very deep insight.
[02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:13.660]   - In other words, Lex, we're watching Ukraine war right now,
[02:24:13.660 --> 02:24:16.060]   and all of our attention is focused on that.
[02:24:16.060 --> 02:24:19.580]   And it's like the economists say in their textbooks
[02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:24.060]   when their powerful models are employed,
[02:24:24.060 --> 02:24:26.060]   and there's this line that says,
[02:24:26.060 --> 02:24:31.060]   "All other factors held constant, comma,"
[02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:33.420]   and then the model works.
[02:24:33.420 --> 02:24:35.180]   And you get this really great result,
[02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:39.680]   this very powerful predictor and analysis of the model.
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:44.320]   And the whole game is all other factors held constant.
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:48.260]   So the Russia-Ukraine war that we've been discussing,
[02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:50.660]   and this could happen and that could happen,
[02:24:50.660 --> 02:24:53.140]   but you know what stuff could happen, Lex?
[02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:57.020]   For example, the Israeli government could decide
[02:24:57.020 --> 02:25:00.260]   this summer that it's gonna bomb Iran,
[02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:03.020]   because no Israeli government will tolerate
[02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:05.900]   Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon.
[02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:10.280]   And since President Trump unilaterally exited
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:14.580]   from the multi-power nuclear agreement,
[02:25:14.580 --> 02:25:17.140]   Iran is now much closer to the bomb than they were.
[02:25:18.140 --> 02:25:21.260]   When the United States was still in that agreement.
[02:25:21.260 --> 02:25:24.220]   And you tell me the Israeli government that says,
[02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:27.020]   "Sure, it's fine, it's okay, Iran can get the bomb."
[02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:29.820]   And so maybe that happens.
[02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:31.880]   And maybe that happens as early as this summer,
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:35.780]   as Iran gets closer and closer and closer to the bomb.
[02:25:35.780 --> 02:25:40.780]   Maybe that guy in North Korea decides it's his time,
[02:25:40.780 --> 02:25:45.060]   just like his grandfather, right, in 1950,
[02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:48.320]   decided it's time, we're gonna reunify,
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:50.800]   unquote, the Korean Peninsula.
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:56.060]   Maybe, I don't know, Lex, fill in the blank.
[02:25:56.060 --> 02:25:59.260]   Something's gonna happen, it's not gonna be what I predict,
[02:25:59.260 --> 02:26:01.920]   it's not gonna be what I'm watching,
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:05.620]   it's gonna be obvious only after it happens, not before.
[02:26:05.620 --> 02:26:08.740]   And then it's gonna upend the table.
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:12.860]   And all of a sudden-- - Everything changes.
[02:26:12.860 --> 02:26:14.700]   - We're gonna be in a different environment,
[02:26:14.700 --> 02:26:19.700]   different circumstances, and is Ukraine still as central
[02:26:19.700 --> 02:26:23.220]   at that point as it seems to be right now?
[02:26:23.220 --> 02:26:24.940]   I don't know the answer to that question.
[02:26:24.940 --> 02:26:28.100]   - Let me ask two rapid-fire questions.
[02:26:28.100 --> 02:26:29.660]   You're only allowed to have one minute,
[02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:32.220]   and it's about predicting the future.
[02:26:32.220 --> 02:26:36.440]   Okay, question one, Vladimir Putin,
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:39.820]   when will he no longer be in office,
[02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:43.340]   and will he step down or be overthrown?
[02:26:44.340 --> 02:26:46.460]   What's your prediction,
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:49.420]   and a brief explanation of that prediction?
[02:26:49.420 --> 02:26:52.020]   Now, nobody can predict the future,
[02:26:52.020 --> 02:26:53.580]   but what's your sense now?
[02:26:53.580 --> 02:26:56.900]   Some people are saying the pressure is building,
[02:26:56.900 --> 02:26:59.540]   he's going to be overthrown or stepped down
[02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:01.100]   at the end of this year.
[02:27:01.100 --> 02:27:06.100]   And some people say, surely he's going to outlast
[02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:09.220]   Stalin's rule of 30-plus years.
[02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:11.260]   - No evidence of a coup yet.
[02:27:11.980 --> 02:27:16.580]   - None whatsoever, yet.
[02:27:16.580 --> 02:27:22.420]   He's pretty much at life expectancy for a Russian male.
[02:27:22.420 --> 02:27:25.620]   Those are bad numbers.
[02:27:25.620 --> 02:27:29.300]   He's 69, gonna be 70.
[02:27:29.300 --> 02:27:32.660]   So he's lived the life of a Russian male already,
[02:27:32.660 --> 02:27:36.140]   but he's got better doctors than the majority
[02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:40.860]   of the Russian males in that, let's say,
[02:27:40.860 --> 02:27:42.740]   comparison set.
[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:46.380]   So he could live a very long time with good doctors.
[02:27:46.380 --> 02:27:49.700]   So there could be a coup at some point,
[02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:54.380]   but there's none today in evidence.
[02:27:54.380 --> 02:27:58.400]   He could go because he's reached the life expectancy,
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:01.020]   or he could stay for a long time.
[02:28:01.020 --> 02:28:06.020]   The thing to watch about this is an organization
[02:28:06.020 --> 02:28:08.580]   that nobody pays attention to.
[02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:12.740]   The FSO, the Federalnaya Sluzhba Akhranny,
[02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:15.140]   which is the Praetorian Guard,
[02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:18.700]   the self-standing bodyguard directorate,
[02:28:18.700 --> 02:28:21.900]   the only one, the only organization in Russia
[02:28:21.900 --> 02:28:24.260]   that has any access to him.
[02:28:24.260 --> 02:28:28.700]   We've seen no disloyalty, no breaking of ranks,
[02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:31.860]   no defections, nothing in the public realm
[02:28:31.860 --> 02:28:35.700]   and in open sources about any divisions
[02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:39.860]   or problems in the FSO, in the Praetorian Guard.
[02:28:39.860 --> 02:28:43.560]   So if you can't break that, change that,
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:50.140]   elicit defections there, you can't overturn him.
[02:28:50.140 --> 02:28:52.900]   Authoritarian regimes, Lex, they're terrible.
[02:28:52.900 --> 02:28:54.700]   They fail at everything.
[02:28:54.700 --> 02:28:57.500]   They can't feed their people.
[02:28:57.500 --> 02:29:00.760]   They have trouble achieving any goals.
[02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:03.200]   They only have to be good, however, at one thing.
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:06.820]   They only have to be good at the complete suppression
[02:29:06.820 --> 02:29:09.000]   of political alternatives.
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:12.440]   If you can suppress political alternatives,
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:14.580]   you can fail at everything else,
[02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:17.680]   but you can survive as an authoritarian regime.
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:19.180]   So you watch Navalny.
[02:29:19.180 --> 02:29:21.780]   He's still alive. - That's question number two.
[02:29:21.780 --> 02:29:23.980]   - Okay, Lex, you go for it. - That's my question number two.
[02:29:23.980 --> 02:29:26.800]   That's my second rapid-fire question,
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:28.420]   is what happens to Navalny?
[02:29:28.420 --> 02:29:30.640]   What are the possible conclusions of,
[02:29:30.640 --> 02:29:32.240]   what you said, quite possibly,
[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:36.260]   the second most influential, powerful figure in Russia?
[02:29:36.260 --> 02:29:41.020]   Is he going to die in jail?
[02:29:41.020 --> 02:29:44.060]   Will he become the next president of Russia?
[02:29:44.060 --> 02:29:45.860]   Well, what are the possible--
[02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:47.520]   - I wish I knew, Lex.
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:50.580]   I've been surprised that he's still alive.
[02:29:50.580 --> 02:29:54.800]   I've been worried that he will be killed in prison
[02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:56.220]   in a staged fight.
[02:29:56.220 --> 02:30:01.740]   Some security officer, prison guard,
[02:30:01.740 --> 02:30:04.420]   puts on a prison outfit, takes a lead pipe,
[02:30:04.420 --> 02:30:07.220]   goes into the cell, they have a, quote, fight,
[02:30:07.220 --> 02:30:08.700]   and Navalny is killed.
[02:30:08.700 --> 02:30:11.640]   I've been afraid of that, but he's still alive,
[02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:14.500]   even though he's serving a long sentence.
[02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:19.140]   So that leads me to guess that people inside
[02:30:19.140 --> 02:30:22.020]   the Putin regime, and maybe President Putin himself,
[02:30:22.020 --> 02:30:27.020]   understand that Navalny is their ticket to lift sanctions.
[02:30:29.100 --> 02:30:33.740]   That Navalny is even more popular outside of Russia
[02:30:33.740 --> 02:30:35.180]   than he is inside of Russia.
[02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:37.580]   You know, he's the leader, in many ways,
[02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:41.060]   of the political opposition in the country,
[02:30:41.060 --> 02:30:42.780]   even while still in prison.
[02:30:42.780 --> 02:30:45.500]   His organization's been destroyed.
[02:30:45.500 --> 02:30:48.740]   But he doesn't have majority support in the population
[02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:50.380]   by any stretch of the imagination.
[02:30:50.380 --> 02:30:52.760]   But he's a big figure in the West,
[02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:55.180]   including here in the US.
[02:30:55.180 --> 02:30:57.500]   And so Navalny could be their ticket,
[02:30:57.500 --> 02:31:00.020]   their kind of get out of jail card,
[02:31:00.020 --> 02:31:02.620]   meaning they release him from prison,
[02:31:02.620 --> 02:31:03.980]   he gets appointed, I don't know,
[02:31:03.980 --> 02:31:06.560]   prime minister even by the Putin regime,
[02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:09.500]   if he were willing to accept such a position,
[02:31:09.500 --> 02:31:11.820]   and I have my doubts about that.
[02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:14.500]   And then that's how they lobby
[02:31:14.500 --> 02:31:17.260]   to remove the sanctions against them.
[02:31:17.260 --> 02:31:20.440]   So he's a card that President Putin could play.
[02:31:20.440 --> 02:31:24.900]   And so maybe that's the reason he's still alive,
[02:31:24.900 --> 02:31:28.540]   or maybe there are other reasons that we don't know.
[02:31:28.540 --> 02:31:31.860]   And so some alternative to Putin
[02:31:31.860 --> 02:31:36.860]   is more likely to arise inside his gang,
[02:31:36.860 --> 02:31:41.660]   Putin's shayka, as they say, right, inside his gang,
[02:31:41.660 --> 02:31:45.820]   where they tire of his mistakes,
[02:31:45.820 --> 02:31:49.600]   they tire of his self-defeating actions,
[02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:52.320]   and they say, patriotically for Russia,
[02:31:53.260 --> 02:31:57.020]   "We need to do something against, move against this guy,
[02:31:57.020 --> 02:31:59.960]   "because he's hurting our country,
[02:31:59.960 --> 02:32:02.360]   "and also because I could do better.
[02:32:02.360 --> 02:32:05.880]   "I'm ambitious as well as patriotic."
[02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:07.960]   But once again, the problem there, Alex,
[02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:12.960]   is Putin is surrounded by this cocoon known as the FSO.
[02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:17.020]   He meets on Zoom,
[02:32:17.020 --> 02:32:20.000]   predominantly with the rest of the government,
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:24.000]   including with the defense and security officials.
[02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:27.880]   They don't have frequent access to his person.
[02:32:27.880 --> 02:32:31.420]   And as you were alluding earlier to the pandemic,
[02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:33.320]   they have to quarantine for two weeks
[02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:35.480]   before every meeting with him.
[02:32:35.480 --> 02:32:39.680]   And moreover, you know, Alex, they don't know where he is.
[02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:41.680]   You see, when they're on Zoom with him,
[02:32:41.680 --> 02:32:46.840]   and the room, it's the Valdai.
[02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:51.920]   His office in the Valdai region looks the same
[02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:54.440]   as his office in Sochi,
[02:32:54.440 --> 02:32:58.400]   or his office outside of Moscow in Novoagriov.
[02:32:58.400 --> 02:33:00.700]   They're made up to look very similar on Zoom.
[02:33:00.700 --> 02:33:05.760]   And sure, some signs, they're looking, where is it?
[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:08.520]   But maybe they don't know,
[02:33:08.520 --> 02:33:10.900]   and so you're gonna move on him,
[02:33:10.900 --> 02:33:13.640]   and you're gonna jump him in his Kremlin,
[02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:17.240]   his dacha outside Moscow.
[02:33:17.240 --> 02:33:20.240]   And it turns out he's in Sochi, or vice versa.
[02:33:20.240 --> 02:33:23.280]   And it turns out the FSO is loyal to him,
[02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:24.920]   and won't let you anyway.
[02:33:24.920 --> 02:33:27.640]   So, Alex, we don't know,
[02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:30.640]   but we watch this FSO really closely,
[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:34.160]   and we think that the elites, if not Putin,
[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:37.240]   but maybe Putin too, understand Navalny
[02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:40.400]   as a really big potential political card
[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:41.960]   that they could play.
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:46.040]   - And one last question, the biggest question.
[02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:49.320]   You studied some of the darkest aspects
[02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:52.160]   of human history, human nature.
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:54.600]   Let me ask the why question.
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:56.360]   What are we doing here?
[02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:59.840]   What's the meaning of our existence,
[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:01.840]   our life here on Earth?
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:04.640]   What are we humans trying to get at here?
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:07.120]   - I can't answer that question either,
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:11.360]   but I can say that having a purposeful life
[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:14.340]   is actually not that hard.
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:18.840]   You can't, you're not Gandhi, right?
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:21.480]   You're not President Roosevelt.
[02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:23.760]   You're not gonna transform a country,
[02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:28.040]   or a civilization, or become immortal
[02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:31.440]   because of your courage, and your insight,
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:33.880]   and your genius at critical moments.
[02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:37.360]   But you live in an environment,
[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:41.200]   you're in a school, you're in a workplace,
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:44.800]   you're somewhere where you can affect other people
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:46.680]   in a positive way.
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:48.700]   It can be not just about yourself,
[02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:50.180]   but it can be about them.
[02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:53.320]   And you can have a positive impact
[02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:57.320]   on other people's lives through the work that you do,
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:00.080]   whether that's your employment, or your charity,
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:03.220]   or your spare time, or your work time.
[02:35:03.220 --> 02:35:07.240]   It can be by modeling proper behavior, right?
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:12.240]   Admitting your mistakes, hard to do, but necessary.
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:14.660]   Remembering that you don't know everything,
[02:35:14.660 --> 02:35:16.060]   you can't predict the future,
[02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:17.500]   but you don't even know everything
[02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:20.240]   in your areas of expertise.
[02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:23.660]   Painfully reminded of that humility at times,
[02:35:23.660 --> 02:35:26.000]   but remind yourself to.
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:31.000]   So you can lead a life that can show others
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:35.480]   what good values are, and you can lead a life
[02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:38.360]   that dedicates yourself not only
[02:35:38.360 --> 02:35:40.920]   to your own material well-being,
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:43.480]   but to the well-being and to the development
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:44.400]   of others around you.
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:47.320]   And it can be on a humble scale.
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:50.340]   It can be in a small classroom, or a small workplace,
[02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:54.740]   a small work team, but it can be done.
[02:35:54.740 --> 02:35:58.720]   And you can be reminded that having a positive impact,
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:02.840]   even on one other person, gives far greater meaning
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:06.580]   to your own life, and is profoundly satisfying,
[02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:10.900]   much more satisfying than the attention you might get,
[02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:15.340]   let's say, on social media, or awards you might receive.
[02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:17.760]   There's nothing wrong with pursuing those.
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:21.220]   People pursue them, and it's a free society.
[02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:27.460]   But leading a purposeful life intentionally is possible.
[02:36:27.460 --> 02:36:30.620]   - Even just one person, I love the expression,
[02:36:30.620 --> 02:36:33.440]   save one life, save the world.
[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:38.100]   Just focusing on the local, on the tiny little difference
[02:36:38.100 --> 02:36:40.740]   you can make in the world can somehow ripple.
[02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:42.100]   - Every day.
[02:36:42.100 --> 02:36:44.540]   If you think about that every single day,
[02:36:44.540 --> 02:36:47.700]   you're a better person.
[02:36:47.700 --> 02:36:49.540]   We're a better society.
[02:36:49.540 --> 02:36:52.220]   - And maybe you get to add a bit of love
[02:36:52.220 --> 02:36:53.820]   to the world after all.
[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:59.220]   Stephen, this is a huge honor for many reasons,
[02:36:59.220 --> 02:37:02.660]   one of which is I can just tell how much care
[02:37:02.660 --> 02:37:06.980]   you put into this conversation, and how much,
[02:37:06.980 --> 02:37:10.020]   I use the word love a lot, but I just feel the love
[02:37:11.020 --> 02:37:14.620]   that just even the respect you give me,
[02:37:14.620 --> 02:37:17.780]   which I can't tell you how energizing that is,
[02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:19.900]   how much that gives me strength
[02:37:19.900 --> 02:37:22.580]   for my own silly little pursuits.
[02:37:22.580 --> 02:37:24.840]   Thank you so much for doing that.
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:26.380]   Thank you for not just talking today,
[02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:29.180]   but giving me so much respect
[02:37:29.180 --> 02:37:30.660]   just with everything you're doing.
[02:37:30.660 --> 02:37:32.340]   I really appreciate that.
[02:37:32.340 --> 02:37:33.780]   It makes me feel special.
[02:37:33.780 --> 02:37:35.980]   So thank you so much for sitting down and talking today.
[02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:38.500]   - Mutual, Lex, thank you as well,
[02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:41.620]   and thank you for the respect that you've shown me.
[02:37:41.620 --> 02:37:43.420]   These are really difficult issues
[02:37:43.420 --> 02:37:45.700]   that don't have simple answers,
[02:37:45.700 --> 02:37:47.360]   but that doesn't mean we give up.
[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:52.980]   We have to keep thinking and learning and trying
[02:37:52.980 --> 02:37:56.100]   and finding solutions in everything we do,
[02:37:56.100 --> 02:37:59.420]   including on these big global tragedies
[02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:01.100]   that we live through.
[02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:04.620]   And it's heartbreaking what's going on.
[02:38:04.620 --> 02:38:06.620]   It just breaks my heart every day.
[02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:09.220]   A person who studies this has been studying this
[02:38:09.220 --> 02:38:12.120]   for decades and it keeps happening.
[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:16.500]   And you think again, and yes, it is again,
[02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:19.260]   but we still have to keep trying.
[02:38:19.260 --> 02:38:22.060]   And we have to be inspired by those people
[02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:24.260]   who are more courageous than we are
[02:38:24.260 --> 02:38:27.540]   and sacrifice more than we sacrifice.
[02:38:27.540 --> 02:38:30.660]   For me, the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
[02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:35.660]   the war in Ukraine is experienced in my study at home,
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:37.660]   and in my office at Princeton,
[02:38:37.660 --> 02:38:40.140]   or my coming office at Stanford
[02:38:40.140 --> 02:38:43.180]   when I move full-time to Stanford in September,
[02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:48.180]   or it's experienced far away in safety and in comfort.
[02:38:48.180 --> 02:38:50.860]   And we have to remember that too,
[02:38:50.860 --> 02:38:52.440]   when we talk about these things,
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:55.080]   when we answer your questions, right?
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:58.180]   That as we speak and as we comment
[02:38:58.180 --> 02:39:00.420]   and think we're experts on these things
[02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:02.520]   from the comfort of our existence,
[02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:07.320]   that there are people in those tragedies right now.
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:09.160]   - With no power, with no food,
[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:12.600]   with full uncertainty about the future
[02:39:12.600 --> 02:39:14.320]   of the health of their children.
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:15.440]   - That's it.
[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:20.000]   - And I've also seen, because I have family in both places,
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:24.240]   homes that were home for,
[02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:28.420]   buildings that were homes for generations now in rubble.
[02:39:28.420 --> 02:39:30.520]   So--
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:33.160]   - Yes, Lex, it just, it hurts.
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:38.160]   And it's Syria, where 350,000,
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:41.260]   at least by UN estimates, died,
[02:39:41.260 --> 02:39:43.960]   and Russia participated in that.
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:47.920]   And it's Yemen, and it's so many other places
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:50.640]   that don't have the same degree of attention
[02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:53.260]   that a European country like Ukraine has.
[02:39:53.260 --> 02:39:57.960]   But yeah, we have to remember also
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:00.560]   that in addition to Ukraine,
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:04.640]   and then there's things right home here in New York City,
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:07.220]   where children are without food,
[02:40:07.220 --> 02:40:11.000]   which is just inexcusable in a country this rich.
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.560]   - So we shouldn't forget in our study of leaders,
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:15.080]   in our study of geopolitics,
[02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:16.800]   that ultimately it's about the humanity.
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:18.200]   It's about the human beings.
[02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:20.760]   - Okay, Lex.
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:21.720]   - Human suffering.
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:22.560]   Thank you so much, Stephen.
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:23.380]   - Thank you.
[02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:24.800]   - This is an amazing conversation.
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:25.880]   Talk to you again soon.
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:26.780]   - My pleasure.
[02:40:26.780 --> 02:40:29.320]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:31.080]   with Stephen Kotkin.
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:32.480]   To support this podcast,
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:35.520]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:38.440]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:39.800]   from Mahatma Gandhi.
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:44.880]   When I despair, I remember that all through history,
[02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:47.260]   the way of truth and love have always won.
[02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:50.880]   There have been tyrants and murderers,
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:54.120]   and for a time, they can seem invincible,
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:56.680]   but in the end, they always fall.
[02:40:56.680 --> 02:40:59.080]   Thank you for listening,
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:00.920]   and hope to see you next time.
[02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:03.500]   (upbeat music)
[02:41:03.500 --> 02:41:06.080]   (upbeat music)
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:16.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
