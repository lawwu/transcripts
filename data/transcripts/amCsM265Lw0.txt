[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   And now for a bit of fun, here's Math Meme Review with Grant Sanderson, aka 3Blue1Brown,
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.280]   that we did after the recently released podcast conversation that you should check out. And also,

[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.120]   I don't know if I actually know what the goal of a meme review is, but I'll just give it to you.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.400]   All right, so on Calm Down Calm Down, A+.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.080]   Just what do you make of the absurd fact that when you divide by zero, that's not allowed,
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.600]   that breaks the universe? And my review is that the devils in the upper right quadrant
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.920]   aren't nearly appreciative enough of projective geometry. So that's my review of them.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.920]   It's been this. Oh, yeah. OK. This is a machine.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.760]   Yeah. Well, machine learning is doing it over and over again, but bigger.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.520]   So sometimes, you know, quantity has a quality all of its own.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.720]   Yeah, scale. Just like with GPT-3, there's some magic that happens.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.240]   Yeah. Einstein didn't have 175 billion parameters. That's my review of that meme.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.480]   This one, whatever numbers you think, whenever you think you know numbers,
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.240]   my review is it's not sufficiently mindful of diversity concerns and how the peodics are
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.240]   consistently underrepresented in people's conception of what the different number systems
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.440]   are. So I think it's, I'm going to say narrow-minded. That's my review of that one.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.800]   All right, you study college-level math. Yes, I am almost done with my bachelor's degree,
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.720]   so you know a lot of math. This one is uncomfortably true.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.080]   This is to our point, is when you get your degree in math.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.760]   There's a lot left to know.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:05.920]   That's not even, it's hard to, oh my god.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.440]   I think there's, so what is that? I think that's a fish eating a cat.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.440]   Yeah, no, so it's a cat eating a fish, and then the fish eating the cat. So
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.960]   I just have to say A+. This should be in every algebra textbook. That's my meme review.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.520]   I poured root beer into a squared glass. Now I just have beer.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.760]   Tired. Not impressed.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.520]   Not impressed. Engineering. Got Mythbusters and such. Physics.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.480]   Oh, this is a prior discussion. This is a prior discussion.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.560]   No one thinks that you could popularize math.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.320]   That's interesting.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.480]   So it ends with, that is insightful. Poignant.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.520]   So do you think there could be a cosmos for mathematics?
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.080]   Yeah, I actually, I think there's huge appetite for it. I think Numberphile proves this fact.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.680]   And your channel, I mean that's true, but there's not, for some reason,
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.080]   do you think there'll be a Netflix show one day with theâ€¦
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.840]   Anyone at Netflix is watching this, I will host it for you. You just call me.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.360]   But do you think you could have a general public kind of show like Cosmos and do mathematics?
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.400]   100%. I think it wouldn't be easy because you've got this tight line between are you
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.160]   doing it substantively or are you just waving your hands? I think there's enough really
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.600]   interesting math that you can substantively get across. And I do think there's a pretty
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.560]   big appetite for it. The reason I say Numberphile isn't just that Numberphile is great, but that
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.280]   Brady has like 10 projects of very similarly styled channels, and Numberphile is the biggest
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.200]   among them by far. But they're all successful. They're all successful, but I would have guessed
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.240]   if you were just pitching these products, you know, like 10 years ago, like, oh, the channel
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.920]   on physics will be very popular, the chemistry one will be pretty popular, the numbers one,
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.600]   I don't know, some people, that might be like third or something. But the idea that the one
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.880]   about math is the most popular of his channels by far, even though they're similar styles,
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.840]   it does, I do think speaks to the fact that there is a unsatiated appetite for real,
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.000]   a real understanding of what gets mathematicians going.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And I think a Netflix type entity might recognize that.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.560]   You heard it here, Netflix.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.240]   Half-off haircuts.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:32.560]   Oh, it's getting shaved. It's every time it's shaving half of the remaining hair.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.200]   This is going to take a...
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.240]   That's...
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.280]   Great, I love it.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.920]   It's kind of brilliant.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.800]   That's my review. No substantive descriptions, just I love it.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.600]   Oh, I actually saw this one for a print.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.840]   Yeah, "Cotechin, Seacant, and Kosyngin, you deserve to be quiet over there. Who needs you?"
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.480]   Oh, you don't give them the love? You think sine, cosine, tangent,
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.720]   these are all...
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.280]   So you make the calculus of like tangent look a little bit more compact, while kind of be confusing
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.200]   to every single calculus student there that's like, wait, what was Seacant again? Just write
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.440]   it as one over cosine squared. It's not that many more symbols.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.640]   Oh, you're contributing to the problem. Well, thank you for doing the most absurd
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.680]   thing I probably have ever done. You probably have ever done. I appreciate it.
