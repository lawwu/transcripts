[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   Optimistic people who are working on the technology tend to underestimate
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.960]   the time it takes to get there.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.100]   But I think that the way I ground myself is by thinking about a self-driving car.
[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.020]   In particular, there is an analogy where if you look at the Tesla, and if you look
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.200]   at the self-driving behavior of it, it looks like it does everything, but it's
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.280]   also clear that there is still a long way to go in terms of reliability.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.960]   And we might be in a similar place with respect to our models, where it
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.220]   also looks like we can do everything.
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.020]   And at the same time, we'll need to do some more work until we really iron out
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.380]   all the issues and make it really good and really reliable and robust and well-behaved.
