[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.220]   It's Friday. That means live Q and A.
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:52.240]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.480]   the knowledge, insight, education and encouragement you need to live a rich
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.960]   and meaningful life now while also working toward your plans for financial
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.240]   freedom, hopefully in 10 years or less.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.160]   My name is Joshua. I am your host.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.460]   I am your advisor and I am your fellow financial freedom philosopher, fellow
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.360]   financial freedom fighter and friendly financial philosopher.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.160]   That was the, that was what I worked out for myself.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:24.400]   On Fridays here at Radical Personal Finance, whenever I can arrange the
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.680]   technical technology, the details, I try to do a live Q and A.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.340]   I love doing these shows and I know that many of you enjoy listening to them
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.160]   because they allow us to cover a diverse array of topics in a quick and easy way
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.560]   and have useful, productive conversations.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.560]   If there's a question or a topic that you would like to discuss with me, your
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.400]   very safest way to get that done is going to either be, of course, to book a
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.480]   personal consulting call.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.080]   If you want to pay a good bit of money for that, you can do that anytime you
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.960]   want and take personal consulting calls booked at radicalpersonalfinance.com/phonecall
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.080]   or to join as a patron of the show and gain access to these Friday Q and A calls.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.760]   And depending on the week, we have anywhere from a handful to more than a
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.660]   handful of callers, but there's plenty of time for us to interact around your
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.060]   specific question.
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.920]   If you'd like to join the show as a supporter, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.280]   Again, radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.360]   Sign up to support the show there and you will have access to the Q and A call
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.120]   information for next week.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.320]   And you can join in with your question.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.840]   We begin with Drew in Kansas City.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.220]   Drew, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.120]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.200]   Hey, good afternoon, Joshua.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.280]   I have a question for my sister, actually, who rents her house out on the weekends
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.080]   through Airbnb.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.000]   It's actually more successful than she thought she would be.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.520]   She's grossing over a thousand dollars monthly.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.720]   So three months in, she's really starting to look at the tax implications on
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.720]   renting out her entire house on the weekends.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.760]   If she could, she'd start tracking everything from cleaning supplies, bedsheets,
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.080]   furniture, utility bills, or even part of her mortgage, if that'd be applicable.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.360]   What kind of property is she renting out?
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.760]   It's a single family house.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.120]   OK.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.600]   So the good news is with tax questions, it's relatively straightforward to answer.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.360]   One of the things about the IRS is that IRS tax laws really make sense.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.040]   Once you understand the underlying doctrine, the underlying approach, they make sense.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.400]   And in this case, the laws are going to be governing the running of this like a business.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.040]   Now, there's a slight difference.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.200]   I would guess that some Airbnb units would be reported as rental income.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.120]   Some would be reported as businesses, depending on how you're actually running it.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.080]   From past web wanderings and web discussions on this topic, I think some people make a
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.360]   distinction between if you're running it like a hotel business or if you're running it
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.040]   like a real estate business.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.640]   I don't know the specifics of that off the top of my head, so you'll have to research
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.400]   that a little bit more.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.560]   But the good news is that businesses, whether they're real estate or businesses like a
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.480]   hotel business, make sense.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.560]   And the rule is simple.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.720]   You take all of the income, you deduct all of the expenses, and that's your profit.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:28.560]   And it is perfectly adequate and legal to deduct every single expense that's associated
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.360]   with the business, and you should ignore every expense that's not associated with the
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.840]   business.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.240]   So the way that she should approach it is to think as comprehensively as she possibly
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.800]   can about everything that's related to the business.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.800]   That will start with what percentage of her house is she renting out.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.200]   You said she's renting out the whole house on the weekends when she can go away.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.680]   Is that right?
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.040]   Yes.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.560]   Okay.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.240]   So in that case, then she's not going to be able to rent out.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.800]   She's not renting out one room every night of the month.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.480]   She would be renting out the whole house for a certain number of nights of the month.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.040]   So she would start by looking at that and figuring out how many days per month.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.880]   Let's say that the house is rented out 20% of the days per month.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.480]   So in this context, some of the expenses associated with those 20% of the days would
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.600]   now be eligible to apply as business deductions.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:36.920]   So if her mortgage payment is $1,000 a month and she's thinking about depreciation
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.320]   versus...
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.920]   Okay, let's just keep it simple.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.960]   Let's just say her mortgage payment is $1,000 a month, but she's renting it out for
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.120]   20% of the time, then chances are 20% of that mortgage expense is going to be
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.280]   associated with the rental income.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.120]   And so she can use that as a deduction.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.080]   If her homeowner's insurance is $200 a month and 20% of the nights she is renting
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.520]   the property out, then 20% of that $200 a month will start to be deductible as an
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.640]   expense for her.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:12.880]   So if you have any expenses associated with the house that is related to the whole
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.720]   house, she can start to deduct a part of those expenses based upon the usage of the
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.640]   actual property.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.160]   The percentage of times it's being...
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.080]   amount of time it's being used for usage.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:32.280]   If there's anything that can be specifically applied to the actual tenants...
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.720]   So an example would be if she had to get a higher, more expensive type of insurance
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.120]   in order to cover her liability protection from tenants.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.200]   Well, 100% of that cost would then be deductible against her income.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.360]   Or if she didn't previously have cable TV in the property, but she went ahead and
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.600]   brought cable TV into the property in order to serve the tenants, then now that
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.920]   would be a deductible expense.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:07.520]   And so things like sheets, things like cleaning supplies, fees and expenses like
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.440]   hiring the cleaner, if she's not doing that herself, all of those things now
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.800]   become a part of the business expenses.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.920]   So what I recommend to her is think through everything possible that's
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.200]   associated with the business, including anything that helps her to be productive
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.040]   in the business.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.360]   So a simple example would be her cell phone.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.400]   She's going to, at this point in time, she'll be booking her clients throughout
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.880]   the week.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.680]   So now her cell phone becomes, because it's being used all the time for business,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.760]   her cell phone now becomes a legitimate business deduction for her personal
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.520]   enterprise.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.680]   And so anything associated with running the business is a deductible expense.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:56.560]   If she just simply applies that simple practice to whatever question she has,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.520]   she will be able to answer her own questions as far as what is deductible
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.240]   and what's not.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.880]   That's perfect.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.600]   I did not know that.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:13.640]   That's a great way of framing it to apply for all the little things and big things
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.960]   associated with the house.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.240]   Taxes make sense.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:23.440]   Once, if we can argue about the underlying doctrines, but for them, as far as that's
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.600]   a political discussion, that's an ideological or a philosophical discussion.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.920]   We can discuss the rightness and wrongness of the ideology that leads to taxes.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.480]   But at least in the United States, I have in all of my years of looking at taxes,
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.560]   there's not really anything in the tax code that doesn't make sense to me.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.320]   The doctrines are generally applied in an equitable way.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.080]   So with businesses, it's simple.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.080]   Now, just practically for her, what I would...
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.000]   Is your sister very organized financially with numbers?
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.880]   Yes.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.320]   Good.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:03.080]   So in that case, what she should do is just use all of her expenses and track all of
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.400]   her expenses for the year.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.120]   But she needs to be careful to maintain a log of what she's doing.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.440]   And there are a few things that would be good to do to help her to be more
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:18.480]   protected from her, in terms of the necessity, if she ever were audited or if
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.200]   she ever wound up in trouble.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.080]   First, she should keep a journal of the property.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:28.320]   So she should keep a separate journal with calendar entries, notating when the
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.080]   property is occupied and when it's not.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.240]   She should carefully note that information so that she can maintain accurate records
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.800]   of the percentage of use that it's actually being rented out.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.680]   My guess would be...
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.400]   I'm thinking about it.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.360]   Well, so she should keep a journal.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.880]   One of the rules with business property is you always want to keep a journal
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.840]   associated with it.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.400]   So let's say that you have a car and you drive that car sometimes for business and
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.880]   sometimes for personal use.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.080]   Well, you want to keep a journal with in the car.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.800]   You take note of the mileage.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.840]   You take note of where you're driving and what you're doing.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.520]   If you have a piece of business property that's used for business primarily, but
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.440]   partly for personal, you keep a journal to make sure that we note that it's used for
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.440]   business property.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.520]   If you have a rental property, keep a journal and just keep those records so you
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.800]   can demonstrate, "Yes, I'm actually keeping track of the number of days that it's
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.040]   used."
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.400]   But when I say journal, I mean something very simple, like a calendar, a paper
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.160]   calendar with an entry each day.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.920]   Is it rented or is it not rented?
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.640]   And she should seek to take advantage of anything she could do that would add in an
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.320]   extra day.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.200]   So Friday to Monday, as an example of when she vacates the property, would pick up
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.560]   and turn her number of tax deductible days into four days.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.080]   If she leaves on Friday evening instead of leaving on Saturday morning, that picks up
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.000]   an extra day as far as the use, which will make a difference of her being able to
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.280]   deduct more expenses.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.840]   Second, she needs to keep receipts and paperwork and develop a simple system to
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.280]   keep those things organized.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.880]   So she should use a simple accounting software to easily collate the specific
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.160]   deductions for the property.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:23.440]   And she should also look at it and use a filing system of some kind so she can keep
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.280]   the actual paperwork and the receipts.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.800]   And she needs to think and study just a little bit about the types of things that
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.720]   could be deductible.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:36.360]   So in this case, if she is running this, again, I mentioned a cell phone, but
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.240]   chances are she may need to use a computer and have a business computer.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:46.080]   It may be now that she could turn her office into a home office if she has a
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.520]   separate piece of her, part of her property that's used for her business
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.480]   pursuits, et cetera.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.680]   Now, there are a lot of little things like that that can be done.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.960]   And if you'll journal them carefully, all of those can be used to track the
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.640]   expenses that are associated with this business to lower her taxable income.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.720]   So good records are the key.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:08.200]   But practically, if she just thinks about it and says, "Is this associated with my
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.360]   business?"
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.080]   If so, it's deductible.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.760]   Anything else, Drew?
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.920]   Any follow-up questions?
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:20.520]   The only follow-up question is, hey, her Airbnb is in Oklahoma City and we live in
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.160]   Kansas City.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.840]   So if you and your family are coming through, we'd love to see it in place.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.320]   Thank you.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.040]   So that's it.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.760]   Appreciate it, Joshua.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.280]   We do intend to move through Kansas City.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.600]   I have some friends near Kansas that we definitely want to visit when we are out
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.120]   traveling.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.960]   So keep an ear out for my whatever methods of communication I wind up choosing to
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.000]   communicate.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.720]   And we will share that information with you.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.800]   Chuck in Tennessee, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.960]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.160]   My question is on the property also.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:55.120]   In 2011, whenever the market was down, we had to relocate for employment.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.800]   And so we became involuntary landlords like a lot of people around that time.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.400]   And we're in the process now, we have a contract on, we're selling that home.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:12.080]   We bought it for about $305,000 and probably put $20,000 into it.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.560]   And because of renters not taking care of property, the sale price is going to be
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.760]   around $270,000.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:26.920]   So my question is, and we paid down quickly enough on the house, so we're getting
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.840]   $30,000 at closing.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.520]   So we do have some equity in the home.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:38.360]   My question is, is there any tax implications or things I need to be thinking
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.960]   about as we get that money at closing?
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:49.400]   One quick note on the previous question, a listener in the chat on the show put in a
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.440]   guide for a NOLO guide on a tax guide for short term rentals.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.440]   And so for the previous caller, Drew, send that to your sister.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:03.120]   NOLO is fantastic in their resources.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.240]   And so they have a tax guide for short term rentals.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.480]   That would be the book to buy.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.280]   And it'll have all the information on deductibility.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.440]   Sorry to do that to you, Chuck.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.280]   I didn't want to forget about that.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:18.000]   So if you have a total invested in the property of $305,000 plus $20,000 of
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.880]   additional cost, and you're going to be selling it for $270,000, then you're going
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.400]   to have a loss, right?
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.160]   Is my math right there?
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.480]   Yes, sir.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:35.640]   So your question is about if there are going to be any tax implications.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.480]   I would say no.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.760]   The only tax implications would be if it's deductible as a long-term capital loss.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:48.880]   And if there's a way that you can then use this loss to offset some of your other
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.440]   income.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.000]   How long did you live in the property and how long have you been landlords?
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:00.200]   We lived in the property, I believe, three years and we've been out now it'll be six
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:00.720]   years.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.200]   So I know what you're referencing.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.640]   I think there's a five-year rule about how long you've been out.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:11.400]   We did list it in taxes as an investment property as we've been doing our taxes the
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.240]   last four or five years.
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.880]   So I think it's going to be simple because the five-year rule relates to your ability
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.680]   to avoid paying any income tax on a gain.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.080]   Because you've been a resident of it.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.040]   But in this case, if it's been a rental property for you for the past six years,
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:35.760]   then I would say you're going to be in good shape for it's going to be a loss for
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.000]   you.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.080]   So I would say I think the key is that you want to look through your records.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.520]   You want to figure out what your actual basis is in the property.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.480]   Figure out which entity to figure that out.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.480]   You need to look at your purchase price, your purchase expenses, put those records
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.720]   together as best you can.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:02.760]   Look at how much of the cost that you have incurred on the property is related to the
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:10.000]   actual improvements to the property and use that to calculate your adjusted basis.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.360]   You won't be able to use your expenses on the property as part of your adjusted
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:16.880]   basis.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.080]   You'll only be able to use the improvements to the property.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.720]   So you would have already expensed your repair costs or things like that on your
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.440]   annual, if you listed it as an investment property, you would have already made those
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.000]   expenses as deductions or simply for expenses.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.880]   But figure out what your adjusted basis is, how much you have in it that you haven't
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.480]   expensed.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:46.120]   And in this case, if you have the, let's just say you found out that it was $325,000
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:53.840]   and you sell for $270,000 after selling expenses, then in this case you have a
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:59.760]   $55,000 loss, which you'll then take as an offset against your other investment
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.920]   activities and or against your income.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.960]   Make sense?
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.200]   Yes, sir.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.440]   That sounds good.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.600]   That answers my question.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.520]   I had some of those thoughts, but I wanted to get some reinforcement on.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.080]   I was thinking of everything correctly.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:17.800]   I appreciate it.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.400]   Absolutely.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.680]   Any follow up questions or anything else?
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.480]   Are that enough for today?
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.160]   I think that's enough for today.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:22.680]   Thank you, sir.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.440]   Absolutely.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.080]   All right.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.200]   Go on to Matthew in Tennessee.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.280]   Matthew, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.400]   How can I serve you today?
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.720]   Good afternoon, Joshua.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.200]   Thank you for taking my call today.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:41.360]   So, so you've told me many times to, you know, in the podcast to, to start creating
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.440]   content and to stop chasing an influencer and start being one.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.120]   So, and one of those ways is by starting a podcast.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.800]   So my question today is actually concerning scheduling an interview with a podcast
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.280]   guest.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.120]   How would you coach me through setting up a podcast interview with an influencer?
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.280]   What are the practical steps of actually reaching out?
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.160]   Do I email them?
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.480]   And also like, do I send them questions beforehand or do both people just kind of
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.160]   show up with a central theme and go from there?
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.040]   Like, how would you coach me in this?
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:13.920]   And in terms of like being able to connect with somebody to, to, you know, to
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.840]   essentially interview them on my podcast.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.720]   Is your website and platform already public or are you in a pre-launch stage?
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.320]   Yes, it's already published and launched.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.600]   So in that case, it's relatively simple.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:32.560]   And basically it just comes down to normal, practical interaction among people to say,
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.320]   how can we actually do this?
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:40.520]   In my experience, the, here are the tools of people who have approached me.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:46.880]   Generally, you will need to first assess whether the, you'll need to first assess
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.960]   whether the person is a big fish or not.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.000]   If they're a big fish, then of course the process is going to be different.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.640]   If you want to interview President Trump on your podcast, that'll be different than
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.520]   interviewing your next door neighbor in terms of the scheduling process.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.960]   You might be able to get President Trump, but there's going to be a whole bigger
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.000]   process to go through.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.320]   So if they're a big fish, then you will need to demonstrate that your platform is
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   worth the time and worth their, you know, their effort because they're going to have
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.920]   a lot of requests.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.480]   And so you need to stand out.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.880]   It's just a matter of thinking about what's in it for this particular guest.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.640]   A guest is not into giving interviews for their own fun.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.760]   They're giving, into giving interviews to spread their message, to build their brand,
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.800]   to build their business or something related to that.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.800]   So if someone is bigger than you'll, your note will need to lead with, "Hey, here are
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.880]   the benefits for you.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.080]   I have a show that has this size.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   I have a show that reaches these things, etc."
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:53.480]   Now, it's, if your show is not yet large or if your platform is not yet large, it's
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.760]   probably best to be relatively circumspect about the size of the effort.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.840]   And just simply to focus on the fact that you're inviting them because it's an honor
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.120]   for any guests that you do invite on your show to appear.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:14.440]   And so in my experience dealing with people, the best thing these days is to be short
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.360]   and to the point with an email of no more than about two sentences.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:23.040]   Two to three sentences becomes the max for those of us who receive lots of emails.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.280]   I am hopelessly overwhelmed by emails.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.680]   And if it's not two or three sentences, it's just hard.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.760]   I mean the best.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.480]   I want to do it, but it's just really hard.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.960]   And so people, either their staff or they themselves are basically constantly
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.080]   filtering and the shorter your question, the better.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.280]   So I would do it basically just like this.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:46.960]   I would say to them, "I have a podcast that is devoted to this topic.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.040]   I'd love to interview you because you're an expert on this.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.560]   And specifically, I want to find out about subject A because that relates
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.840]   perfectly to my topic.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.520]   Are you willing to come on my show?"
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:05.960]   Something like that is ideal where you're explaining what you're doing, why you're
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:11.000]   asking, and what specifically you want to talk to them about.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.560]   For most people, especially if they're active in media, that's sufficient.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.160]   Now for somebody who doesn't do a lot of media interviews, they would
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.560]   probably have more questions.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.720]   But for most people who are active in media, that's enough to get things started.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.920]   If they're very busy, they'll respond back and they'll say, "Well, I'm willing
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.720]   to do it, but here are the things I need to change, or here are the requirements
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.520]   that I have, or could we talk a little bit more?"
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.760]   But most speakers and most people who are at a level at which you're probably
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.920]   interested in bringing them on your podcast are used to speaking extemporaneously.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.840]   They don't need a whole lot of preparation.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.800]   And as long as you make it easy for them, then you're good to go.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.800]   So the actual process of scheduling, you need to figure out your technology, how
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.080]   you're actually going to do it.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:02.720]   The very simple ways without getting into podcast technology are going to be for
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:09.200]   you to use a simple voiceover IP communication methodology such as Skype.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.800]   That's usually the standard, but there are many others that you can choose.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.320]   Or just simply to set it up so that you can call them on a phone line.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.680]   And there are many technological ways you can do that.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.080]   There are other good applications for getting a higher quality recording, but
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:30.320]   I don't want to turn this show into a techno babble on those particular things.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.320]   But most people, if you just tell them the subject and you arrange the time,
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.320]   it would be good to go.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.440]   Now, in terms of how to actually, what questions you want them to have,
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.240]   that'll largely come down to you.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.320]   Do you want to prepare for them the list of 10 questions that you're going to
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:50.120]   discuss with them, or do you want to speak to them extemporaneously?
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:55.200]   It is helpful, I think, if you clarify the question so that they can think
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.640]   through some useful ideas in advance.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.480]   I'm generally able to come up and be a better guest if I have a little bit of
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:06.560]   an advance notice of the area that I can focus on for an interview.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.800]   But don't make it overwhelming.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.240]   Note, you're never going to get through 20 or 30 questions, so
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.800]   perhaps five to 10 is ideal.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.880]   And use it in what I would always say is recognize the value of a podcast
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:25.440]   interview is partly for you to build your brand and to build your platform.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.440]   And that is of extreme importance.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:34.880]   But part of it is for you to build your network and to interact with somebody
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.120]   whose ideas you're genuinely interested in learning about.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.200]   If you do it that way, make sure to schedule a little bit of time to speak
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.880]   with them at the beginning and on the end about anything personal as well.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:54.760]   So don't think entirely myopically about the interview itself.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.680]   Also think about how you can help and serve them.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.200]   And also think about any personal connection or
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.560]   interaction that you'd like to have.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.000]   Any follow up questions, Matthew, or is that enough to get you started?
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.320]   No, that's enough to get me started.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.320]   Thank you very much, Joshua.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.760]   I do think that a good interview is probably one of the most valuable
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.520]   strategies really ever done, and I think this has always been available.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:27.600]   It feels like it's more popular now with the proliferation of podcasts.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:32.120]   But I think that many people have used this as their personal strategy to
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.520]   improve their network for decades.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:42.080]   If you're writing a story on somebody, or if you're researching a specific topic,
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:48.480]   or if you are focusing on learning about something that you care about, going out
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.400]   with a notebook and a pen to interview somebody is an entirely valid way for you
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.560]   to get in front of somebody that you'd like to meet, and I recommend it.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.040]   I've recommended it for many years to many people.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:08.880]   Podcasting has a unique flavor in that it allows you to profile somebody that
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:15.200]   you're interested in interacting with in a way that you can't do just simply
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.920]   with a written interview, meaning if you're writing a story about them.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:24.200]   So podcasting is really neat, and podcasting I think is a superior way to
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:29.280]   do this over video because technologically it's much simpler, but in terms of
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:34.400]   building your career for any listener, I would strongly recommend that you build
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:39.320]   a platform related to your area of interest and related to your career.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:45.200]   So what that looks like is you should maintain a website that's related to
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.280]   your work or to your area of interest, and on that website you should curate content.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.200]   You should curate articles, links, discussions, write your own essays,
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.920]   book reviews, et cetera, and interview experts on the topics that you're interested in.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:05.600]   And if you are trying to reach somebody really high, it's relatively simple.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:11.720]   Let's say that you were trying to get, well, you know, President
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.800]   Trump is probably a bad example, but let's say that you're trying to come
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:21.960]   to the attention of somebody who is on your list as a big shot,
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.680]   a total big shot in your industry.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.800]   It's very simple and very easy.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:33.480]   Buy all of their books, read their books, write careful book reviews,
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.040]   and write essays about the ideas that they present.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.080]   If you agree with them, state how you agree and why.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.000]   If you disagree with them, state how you disagree and why.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.960]   Most people have a Google alert set up for their name, especially most people
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.560]   who would be in a place of prominence.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.600]   And so if you're writing about somebody on the internet, there's a good chance
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.760]   they're going to become aware of that.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.200]   And they'll be looking to see, well, what's working and what's not.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:14.440]   And especially in today's world where most public professionals will maintain a public
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:21.320]   profile, public Twitter profile, you can easily write a review and in your review,
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:27.120]   put down that you are working your way through the 10 books written by Mr.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.280]   Big Shot and systematically work your way through those books and your series of
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.400]   articles, reviewing those books, reviewing the key ideas.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:39.680]   And as you publish your articles, copy them on Twitter and @ them on Twitter.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.280]   They'll see it.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.080]   They'll generally see it.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.280]   Most people will look at things.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:48.480]   And especially if you're doing good work, even if you're critical, if you're really
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:55.360]   engaging with their ideas and with their content, then you'll be able to bring
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.800]   yourself onto their radar screen.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:02.880]   And then you can use that strategy and parlay that into an additional interview.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:10.800]   So let's say that I were starting today and I wanted to be an expert in, I don't
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.440]   know a subject to use, but I wanted to be an expert in a certain subject.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.680]   And I had a platform of zero.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.720]   I had an influence base of zero.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.440]   I would build a website and I would start putting out the
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.360]   information about that website.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.080]   And if I'm going after a relationship with Mr.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.640]   Big Shot, there's a good chance that I'm not going to be able to offer Mr.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:35.400]   Big Shot any value by being on my platform in the early days.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:41.320]   But if I start to engage with their ideas, then it changes everything.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.200]   And if you, a year from now, write an email to Mr.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.120]   Big Shot, inviting him to be on your show, and you can say, by the way, I'm
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.280]   a big fan of his work, here is a link to the 10 book reviews I've written of the
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.480]   10 books, here's a link to four critical essays where I was critical of his ideas
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:02.160]   here, and here are a link to five essays that I've written about, or podcast
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:07.200]   episodes that I've done that are really complimentary of his ideas here.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.120]   Somebody who is a leading business professional, a leading intellectual
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:16.360]   will find that very refreshing, especially if you've engaged with their content.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.240]   I observe frequently, I watch a number of public intellectuals, and what I observe
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.760]   is that most public intellectuals are interested in their ideas being
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:32.960]   interacted with, not in being raised up or diminished just unnecessarily.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.240]   And so usually what a public intellectual or a public person or a leader of some
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.320]   kind, whether that's your local mayor, a local business leader, et cetera, by the
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.000]   time somebody has come to a place of prominence, their skin has thickened to
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.400]   the point where they don't mind a little bit of criticism, but they're looking to
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.480]   see the idea behind it, what's actually happening.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.360]   And so you can use your platform to demonstrate that you're a thoughtful
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.680]   and serious person interacting with their ideas.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.240]   And if they're connected to your particular area of expertise, the career
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:06.560]   that you're building, or to your area of focus in terms of your research, that
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.520]   will provide for you a really high quality resume and will make them very
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:20.000]   likely to come to, make you very likely to stand out among the noise.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.080]   And there's a good chance that if you're a serious fan of somebody, and they're a
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.200]   big shot, even if you have a very small platform or non-existent platform, if
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.640]   you've demonstrated that you're serious with ideas, you're serious in your
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.440]   thoughtfulness, and you really want to interact with them, and you've done that
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.840]   in writing, then there's a good chance you'll be able to bring them in to your
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.520]   particular area of focus.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:48.760]   Now, in this case, text is superior because text can be scanned.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:55.200]   It would be, I think, short-sighted to create 10 podcasts all about somebody's
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.160]   work, because there is zero chance that that person would ever do anything other
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.160]   than listen to the first two minutes of your podcast.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.480]   But you can write 10 articles about somebody's work, and they'll quickly
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.160]   scan three or four of them to make sure they've got the gist of it, and then
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.760]   they would likely agree to be on your show.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.880]   This is a strategy that anybody can use.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.320]   And I'll go a little bit further with just a couple more pieces of
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.520]   advice before I hit the music.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:23.320]   When you're interacting with VIPs, with people who are public or who
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.600]   are influential or et cetera, here's what I have learned.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:33.320]   People who are publicly influential frequently try to keep themselves
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.720]   somewhat available.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:40.720]   You'll notice that most people who speak at a conference are going to stay around
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.200]   for a few minutes, and as long as they can spare to interact with people.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.360]   You'll notice that when somebody is appearing at a public event, they'll stay
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.840]   around for a few minutes to interact with people.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:55.600]   People who are publicly prominent, whether it's, again, the mayor of your
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.320]   local town, the superintendent of the school board, et cetera, they know they
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.800]   have a responsibility to their constituents to be available.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.400]   You can't be a leader and not be somewhat available.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:12.560]   Now, there is a point of excess, and so most celebrities will not give
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.480]   themselves to a place of excess, but people who are publicly prominent make
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.920]   their living and their trade is by their customers and by their fans.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.000]   And so they make themselves available.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.280]   The very best strategy that I know of to bring yourself to somebody's
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:34.680]   attention is to interact with their work first, ask a thoughtful question of them
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.040]   and ask them for a specific piece of advice.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:44.040]   Anytime that I have interacted with a listener of my show in public, where
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:48.800]   they've asked a thoughtful question that demonstrated to me that they were aware
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:55.080]   of some of the unique things I talk about and asked for a specific piece of advice,
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.920]   I always noticed that person, and I've used this strategy myself in
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.800]   interacting with prominent people.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.560]   But the key is when somebody gives you advice, actually act on it.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.280]   Take their advice.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:13.560]   If somebody recommends a book for you, get it and read it, and then write them
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.000]   a note saying, I read that book.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.320]   Here was what I thought of it.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   What do you think would be the next thing to do?
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:25.040]   What I think most people of prominence have learned is that almost nobody
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.760]   wants to actually do what they say.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.400]   People of prominence will frequently give advice after advice,
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.960]   after advice, after advice.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:42.320]   And so there is these people, when people don't take action, they just
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.520]   kind of say, well, that's normal.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.560]   But when somebody takes action on something, they say, they immediately
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.160]   start paying attention to them.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.760]   I'll give you an example.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.040]   I have a fan of this show and a listener to this show.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.960]   His name is Zachary.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.800]   And Zach originally wrote me an email and he said, Joshua, I'm a young man.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   I think he was 13 years old when he first wrote his email to me.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.160]   He said, I'm a young man.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:11.280]   And he asked me, started to ask me questions about, I can't
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.680]   remember what, advice, advice for him.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.200]   I recorded an episode of the show for him.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.000]   I think it was what I would give, what advice I would give
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.680]   to a 13 year old specifically.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.520]   Well, what was interesting about Zachary is that, or Zach, sorry, he goes by Zach.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.000]   Well, what's interesting about Zach, I never go by Josh, so
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.120]   I always extend people's names.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.440]   I go by Joshua, not Josh.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.600]   So I automatically have this tendency to extend people's names, do
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.120]   what I do myself with my own name.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:41.400]   The interesting thing about Zach is that he listened to the show and then he wrote
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.960]   me back and gave me feedback on it.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.920]   And then he started to actually implement the ideas.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.720]   He has gone on, he's gone on to ask me other questions.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.600]   He's called in the show.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.640]   I've recorded other shows throughout the history of
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.240]   Radical Personal Finance about it.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.040]   He went on, he started a website.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:01.320]   He now has a website, which is a website that is devoted to his journey.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.280]   He's working to finish his undergraduate degree by the time he
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.560]   graduates, by the time he's 18 years old.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.080]   So I kind of turned him on to some of those ideas and he's
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.280]   working his way through that.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.360]   Zach and his family came to Florida.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.280]   They came to my home.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.080]   We hosted them for dinner, enjoyed interacting with him and with his parents.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.840]   And I built a relationship with him.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.480]   He follows all of my things on social media.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.640]   He frequently likes and retweets my content.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.240]   And so I always pay attention to him.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.880]   And from time to time, whenever he, I don't follow him or
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.480]   really anyone on social media, but whenever I see him, I'll go over and
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.200]   I'll look and I'll say, "Oh, what's Zach writing about?"
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.240]   And I have an interest in him.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.800]   And I've coached people and had people do this again and
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.520]   again with very public people.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.080]   I'm not a big shot.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.600]   I don't think of myself as a big shot.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.960]   I don't really even want to be a big shot.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.520]   But there are people who are legitimately big shots and I've seen them do it again
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.960]   and again and again and again.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.840]   And most people who are big shots, most people who are prominent, they want
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.720]   to see an impact of their message.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.800]   When a preacher preaches, they don't preach just to make themselves feel good.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.400]   They want to preach so that somebody will change and somebody will do.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:13.120]   When a teacher teaches, they're not teaching just to make themselves feel good.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.640]   They want to teach so that somebody will do.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.040]   When a business leader is leading, they're leading in a way that they
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.360]   want to make an impact and everybody, we all know that we've got to pass along
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.360]   to another generation, another generation of disciples and younger people.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.880]   We've got to pass along what we do well.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.560]   And so the very best way to bring yourself to somebody's attention,
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:45.200]   somebody who's important, is to be a good student, be a good disciple, be a good
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:50.080]   learner, and you don't even have to do this.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:55.600]   You don't have to agree with somebody, but if you're fair in your approach,
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.320]   and of course the range here is huge, but if you're, even if you're critical
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.320]   of somebody, if you're fair in your approach and you're fair in your
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.400]   critiques, that person will pay attention to you.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:11.920]   Now they may combat you, but you might help them to improve.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.680]   So I commend that to you.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.960]   Use the story of Zach.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.360]   I'm telling you about Zach.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:22.560]   I'm telling you his story because he set himself apart
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.160]   by actually doing something.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:29.720]   I think if memory is right, I've only ever emailed Zach once or twice
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:33.960]   because I am not good at responding, but he still writes to me.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.960]   He writes to me and he tells me, "Hey, here's what I'm doing."
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.480]   He keeps me aware of what's going on.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.760]   And you can do that in your business.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.240]   You can do that in your career.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.720]   You can do that in your studies.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:49.440]   You can learn your way systematically into a place of prominence.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:54.040]   And really any person that you wanted to have a relationship with,
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.760]   I think you could do it.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.920]   Now there may be some exceptions to that.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:05.240]   Somebody, but I really, you know, I don't think, some things may take
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:09.000]   more time than others, but I think there are very few, very few exceptions to this.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.400]   If you will study somebody or study their work or interact with them,
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.240]   and you'll do it consistently, especially if they have published materials.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:22.520]   A little bit hard if it's just your, your, a local person, um,
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.600]   who doesn't have any published material.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   But if, but in that case, you don't really need to break through.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.200]   All you need to do is ask good questions.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:35.400]   But you can learn your way into relationships and it's never
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.480]   been easier than it is now.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.200]   Here's why I have no fear of sharing these strategies with you.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.480]   I'm sharing with you things that I have done in the past and doing,
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.200]   and will continue to do for my own benefit.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.640]   But I have no fear of sharing them with you.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   You know why?
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.320]   Because you won't do them.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.760]   You won't do them.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:00.440]   You'll know about them and you'll hear about them, but you
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.200]   won't actually do the hard work.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:07.360]   Now, some people do, and it could be you.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:13.400]   If you choose, it could be you who would do something, but I know, and everyone
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.120]   knows most people won't do things.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.920]   I used to think that ideas needed to be protected and guarded.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:23.200]   I've become convinced that they really don't because nobody actually
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.640]   does anything with most ideas.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.840]   It's all about execution.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:30.000]   I used to think that my ideas were great and I've learned that no, they're really.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:30.680]   Okay.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.440]   And the key is execution.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:37.000]   So most people don't do anything with them, but here's the cool thing about execution.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.600]   It's your choice.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.560]   You can choose to do something.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.960]   I laid out a strategy that works.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.640]   You can judge it if you think it's good or not, and then you
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.520]   can choose to do it or not.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.040]   And that is your choice.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.760]   So I challenge you, do something with it.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.880]   Anyway, thank you for listening to today's show.
