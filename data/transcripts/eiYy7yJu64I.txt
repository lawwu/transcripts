[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - Happy Friday, everyone.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.400]   We have an email from a listener today.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.580]   Here it is, Pastor John, my name is Sarah,
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.400]   and I admire your ministry.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.340]   I'm 19 years old and have listened to your sermons
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.580]   off and on throughout the last two years.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.620]   They have really helped me desire God.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.780]   I'm learning what it means to delight in Jesus.
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.180]   I attend a Christian university and have felt called
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.260]   to do something in ministry or evangelism.
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.900]   My question is, how as a woman can I work in ministry
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.500]   and evangelism while abiding by biblical rules
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.580]   and instructions for women,
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.380]   as in not having authority over a man?
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.240]   Pastor John, I would love if you could answer this
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.400]   because I am confused.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.420]   - Amen, amen, amen, that she feels called
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.260]   to ministry and evangelism or whatever.
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.260]   I just wanna so affirm that women and men are ministers.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.260]   In no way does any biblical view of manhood
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.020]   and womanhood imply that men are out and about
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.300]   being active for Jesus and women are not out and about
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.780]   being active for Jesus or in and about being active
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.940]   and Jesus with, for Jesus and their families.
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.020]   So amen to the question.
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.020]   And I would really encourage her or any of the other women
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.680]   who are asking questions.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.940]   I've tried along with Wayne Grudem
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.220]   to ask 50 crucial questions.
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.780]   That's the booklet, they can get a free PDF of it
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.740]   at Desiring God, or you can buy the booklet at Amazon.
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.820]   50 crucial questions in which I try to answer that question
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.960]   and 49 others.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960]   But here, just a few pointers.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.960]   First, Sarah is right to care about both things,
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.760]   dreaming ministry and honoring God's pattern
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.940]   of how men and women relate to each other in all of life,
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.140]   both home and church and society.
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.140]   And she's right that the Bible is not as unclear
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.620]   as some people think it is on 1 Timothy 2.13.
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.980]   "I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.540]   over men, rather she is to remain in quietness
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.580]   as she learns."
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.680]   Those two things, teach and exercise authority,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.660]   are the very two things that distinguish an elder
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.980]   from a deacon.
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.100]   Elders are to exercise authority or govern,
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.360]   and elders are to be the authoritative teachers
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.200]   in the church.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.340]   So what Paul seems to be saying here
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.340]   is that there should be male elders in the church.
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.440]   Not all teaching and not all authority are restricted
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.960]   from women in that verse.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.640]   It's over men.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.480]   There's a kind of authoritative teaching over men
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.960]   that is referred to there.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.700]   And it compromises the way God has wired men and women
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.080]   when women, over time, become the authority
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.560]   in a man's spiritual life.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.400]   I really believe that.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.560]   I think that's why Paul put that there.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.200]   It undermines something deep in both the man and the woman.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.480]   But there are endless possibilities for ministry for women
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.680]   in this world that do not put them under
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.520]   or into that position.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.080]   I wrote another little booklet called "What's the Difference?"
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.960]   And at the end of that booklet,
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.960]   I put 80 kinds of ministries just to give women examples
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.440]   of what kinds of things are open to them.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.820]   Let me close with a story.
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.200]   As I have talked over the years in various places
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.680]   on manhood and womanhood issues,
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.680]   back in the '80s, I would get a lot more vicious,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.480]   negative flack than I do today.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.640]   And I can remember one young woman really angry at me
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.360]   saying, "How dare you call my calling
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.360]   "to ministry into question?"
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.760]   And instead of saying to her what I might have said,
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.520]   like, "I'm not calling it into question.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.760]   "God is calling it into question," I didn't go there.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.760]   I just said, "You know, it may be that you haven't
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.620]   "misheard the voice of God,
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.920]   "but that you've misapplied the voice that you heard."
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.320]   In other words, maybe God is saying to you,
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.420]   "Follow me, serve me, give your whole self to me.
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.840]   "I'm gonna use you mightily in my purposes on the earth
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.140]   "to glorify myself and to save sinners
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.140]   "and to build up saints.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.120]   "I'm gonna use you for that."
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.900]   And then you maybe took it and spun that out
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.340]   in terms of, "Oh, I guess I'm supposed to be a pastor
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.760]   "and have authority over men in that role."
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.360]   And I just said, "Maybe not.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.200]   "Maybe you've just misread the word."
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.020]   And then when they say,
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.840]   "Well, what are you saying we can do?"
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.840]   My answer is 75% of the seven billion people in the world,
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.400]   I just checked this to make sure this is a true statement,
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   75% of the seven billion people in the world
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.600]   are women or under the age of 15.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.040]   They have limitless needs of every kind, right?
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.040]   Physical needs and education needs and spiritual needs
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.440]   and relational needs and parenting needs
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.000]   and needs for rescue and endless needs that they have.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.960]   And my response is do anything you want.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.640]   Care about them, care about them physically
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.120]   and especially eternally
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.480]   and minister in whatever way you can.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.840]   - Yes, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.440]   And once again, those books are titled
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.160]   "50 Crucial Questions About Manhood and Womanhood"
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.720]   and "What's the Difference?"
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.880]   And that long list of ministry opportunities for women
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.080]   can be found in an article Pastor John wrote
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.560]   titled "A Challenge to Women"
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.000]   published on January 1st, 1995.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.360]   The two books and the article can be found free of charge
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.560]   at desiringgod.org,
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.040]   all because we have generous financial donors like you.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.400]   So thank you.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.560]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.320]   and have a wonderful weekend.
