[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.120]   I want to talk about how to buy Treasury bonds and various buying strategies to consider
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.360]   Because after I discussed buying Treasury bonds with over a 4% yield
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.100]   Many people email me asking me how to do it
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.960]   and also
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.560]   I spent three hours writing a new post on how to exactly buy Treasury bonds and I came to some
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.760]   Realizations that I think many of you will appreciate
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.840]   first of all
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.640]   Treasury bonds have been zooming higher the 10-year bond yield reached 4%
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.040]   the morning of September 28, it hasn't been there since
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:46.160]   2007 it's been a while folks and it's interesting because there is not more demand during the Treasury bond
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.880]   auctions
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.960]   It's weird to me that 4% doesn't seem attractive because I can see in
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.260]   3, 4, 5 years when we look back on today
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.440]   We might think to ourselves Wow, we could have locked in
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.720]   4% risk-free rate of return over a 20-year time period
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.960]   Hmm, not bad, but nobody knows the future which is why investing is so interesting
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.180]   So hard and why we need to invest for the long term in a proper asset allocation framework
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.820]   If you don't know what a Treasury bond is, that's okay
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.540]   They are risk-free investments if you hold them until maturity
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:29.200]   Treasury bonds are issued by the United States federal government the Treasury to finance projects or and day-to-day operations as
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.320]   Inflation and inflation expectations rise and fall so do Treasury bond yields now
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.800]   There are two ways to buy Treasury bonds. The first way is through Treasury direct Treasury direct gov
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.820]   It's a terrible website super cumbersome
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.580]   Don't lose your password folks because you're gonna spend an hour trying to get someone on hold to reset it
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.940]   But if you go to Treasury direct gov, you can buy all sorts of bonds
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.040]   You can buy I bonds
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.240]   Hopefully y'all bought 10,000 worth at the end of 2021 when I was talking about it and the beginning of 2022
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.880]   Because these bonds have outperformed the stock market obviously year-to-date and will probably continue to outperform
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.820]   For the rest of the year now you go to Treasury direct gov and you can click buy direct
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.840]   Select bonds or bills so Treasury bills are
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.400]   Bonds that have a one year or less duration Treasury bonds are bonds that have a duration of
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.920]   Beyond one year, but you can just call them Treasury bonds in general
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.540]   So Treasury direct sells bonds directly to you at auction at par value
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.680]   So you're buying the bond at $100 per share
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.880]   This is very different from the second way to buy Treasury bonds
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.620]   Which is through your online brokerage account like Fidelity Charles Schwab or E*Trade
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.400]   These are the giants you pay a nominal fee by receiving a lower bond yield usually about three to five basis points lower
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.760]   So we're talking instead of let's say getting a four point two five percent yield to maturity
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.960]   You'll get four point two percent because this is a marketplace
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.940]   online brokerage accounts provide a marketplace for
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:21.440]   Treasury bonds and other bonds that have already been issued and they're just trading up and down depending on the economic
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.920]   Environment. This is the main difference Treasury direct gov
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:32.180]   You're buying directly from the Treasury Department at par value you get the coupon you get the yield to maturity
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.800]   Whereas when you buy US Treasury bonds on online brokerage accounts their marketplace and these bonds could have been issued years ago
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.700]   With different coupon payments and different yields if you click the post in the show notes, you'll see a step-by-step
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.140]   Direction guide on how to buy bonds via Fidelity. I use Fidelity. I've used them for over 20 years
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.660]   I think they're great
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.640]   But the quickie here is to log on to your Fidelity account if you have one go to the tab news and research
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:08.460]   Click fixed income bonds and CDs and then you'll see a whole bunch of bonds a nice table
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.860]   organized by US Treasury
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.900]   corporate bonds municipal bonds
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.900]   And then you'll see each bond yield by duration and then you just click that link and then you can sort through the marketplace
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.700]   To see which bonds are most attractive now
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:32.540]   This is the point where it can get a little bit confusing because you might click a duration a type of bond and you'll see
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.580]   Ten of them listed. Well, what's going on there? Well again
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.060]   Fidelity Vanguard eTrade Charles Schwab. They are marketplaces. So once you click the appropriate
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.580]   time the maturity
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.060]   You're gonna see a whole bunch of bonds being sold by individuals or institutions
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.480]   Most likely and you can pick or choose some you'll see well, why is the coupon?
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.020]   1.625%
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.460]   Well, another coupon is only
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.060]   0.25%
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.100]   Well, the reason why is because at the time of issuance of these bonds directly from the government
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.180]   Those were the coupon payments, right?
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.620]   so what you want to look at is the yield and if you're looking for let's say a
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.460]   Two-year Treasury bond. Well, it's around four point three percent right now
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.820]   So if you click the link, you'll see a whole bunch of bonds being offered at around between let's say four point two
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.500]   seven five percent to four point three two five percent
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.180]   So you'll notice when you click through the individual bonds
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:40.940]   They were all issued at different dates. So different dates different time periods different coupon rates
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.760]   But they will all be expiring in two years time
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.740]   So in this case 2023 around September or October
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:57.480]   And so you got to sort through that and so if you've been wondering why the coupon payment is so different. It's because
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:05.240]   Different dates and so you will notice that you can buy these Treasury bonds at a discount to par value
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:13.420]   And if you hold them to maturity, you're gonna get that semi annual coupon payment usually and you'll get a hundred dollars per share
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.440]   So if you bought let's say it at ninety seven dollars and twenty cents and it
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.840]   Expires not expires and matures in one year
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:28.120]   You'll get a hundred dollars back plus the coupon payment for a yield of about four point three percent
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.220]   Hope this makes sense. If not read the post listen to this example again
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.700]   Bonds are confusing because the price movements are inverse bond
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.400]   Prices go down yields go up and vice versa now if you want to take more risk
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.480]   You can purchase longer duration CDs Treasury bonds or municipal bonds
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.360]   The risk here lies in liquidity risk and real interest rate risk not principal risk
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.680]   Because you plan to hold it to maturity
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.440]   if you don't hold the bond to maturity you can end up on this marketplace because
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.620]   You know you needed the liquidity and so you sell at a discount to par
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.320]   For example, let's say you purchase a 20-year municipal bond, but need the money before 20 years
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.120]   You will likely have to sell at a discount
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.360]   Now if you lock in a 10-year Treasury bond at let's say three point nine two percent
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:25.840]   But inflation continues to increase then you've locked in a sub optimal yield. Why is it sub optimal?
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.840]   well, it's because you could have waited and
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.520]   Purchased a different or new 10-year Treasury bond that had a higher yield
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:40.480]   now finally if you want to take even more risk, you can purchase corporate bonds all the way down to be a and
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:48.120]   BBB rated corporate bonds now corporate bonds are higher risk because corporates have a higher default and
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.320]   Bankruptcy rate than municipalities and the federal government, right?
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.680]   We see corporations come and go all the time in the history of time
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.960]   But the United States government has stayed sovereign. It's stayed here for hundreds of years now
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.120]   Okay, so three reasons why you might want to buy US Treasury bonds one
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:14.640]   You want a risk-free investment with a higher yield if US Treasury bond yields are higher than yields for savings accounts and CDs
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.200]   Then buying a Treasury bond with the same duration makes sense
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.640]   US Treasury bond income is also not taxed at the state level
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:28.280]   So if you live in high income tax states such as California like I do New Jersey, Connecticut and Hawaii
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.200]   US Treasury bonds offer relatively higher returns
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.480]   - the risk-free yield is attractive relative to your inflation
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.000]   Forecasts and also stock return forecasts
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.080]   For example, you could buy a five-year Treasury bond today yielding about four point one eight percent
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.160]   If you believe inflation will decline from let's say eight percent now to two percent in one year
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.360]   You will earn a two point one eight percent real yield for four more years
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:01.680]   If you hold to maturity in addition, you could sell the five-year Treasury bond for a profit since it will likely
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.080]   increase in value
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.400]   How much the principal value of the Treasury bond increases will depend on inflation expectations
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.520]   however
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.840]   The Treasury bond could also increase in value to the point where the yield is at parity to the two percent
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:22.080]   inflation rate at the time in other words while holding this bond you could earn that coupon payment and
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:28.080]   Earn a greater return because the principal value has appreciated by more than the yield
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.400]   Let's say it might have appreciated by like eight percent eight percent plus and say the one
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   Percent coupon payment that's a nine percent return
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.740]   This is thinking like a bond trader acting like a bond trader and my final
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.200]   Favorite reason for why you want to buy US Treasury bonds today
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:50.440]   Or maybe any point in the future is if you have a low mortgage rate and you like the idea of living for free
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:57.400]   Who doesn't love living for free or getting something for free even ultra rich people have a difficult time passing on a free lunch
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:03.760]   So if you want to connect with someone offer them a free lunch offer them coffee drinks, whatever it is
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.540]   Heck this podcast is free and financial samurai commas free and the newsletter is free
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:15.500]   You might as well subscribe and listen to it. There's no downside, especially since I have over 25 experience
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:22.440]   Working in finance and writing about finance now back to the low mortgage rate and living for free
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   The majority of mortgage holders have a mortgage rate below the yield of a one-year Treasury bond or longer duration in other words
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.920]   The mortgage rates majority people have are below 4%
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:40.760]   Therefore mortgage holders can simply buy US Treasury bonds to live for free for the next 30 years
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:47.320]   For example, you could buy a 30-year Treasury bond right now at about 3.8 percent yield for the last two years
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.780]   Most mortgage borrowers were able to refinance to a 30-year fixed rate of 3% or less
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:11:00.120]   Everybody who comments on my mortgage related posts say they got 30-year fixed rate mortgages for 2.75 percent or less
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:07.600]   Therefore not only could you live for free for the next 30 years, but you could also live for free and earn risk-free income
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:14.600]   Now the only catch is that to truly live for free you need to buy an equal amount of Treasury bonds to your mortgage amount
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:22.320]   But even if you can't which most of us can't every dollar you do spend buying higher yielding Treasury bonds is an arbitrage
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:29.720]   That lowers your true living costs. I want to end this episode by discussing Treasury bond buying strategies
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.240]   In a nutshell in a rising interest rate environment
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:41.200]   Buying shorter duration Treasury bills is the optimal strategy and in a declining interest rate environment
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   Buying longer duration Treasury bonds is the optimal strategy
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.800]   Now, why is that? Well in a rising interest rate environment
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:56.880]   Rates are continuing to go up. So you want to take advantage of the wave up you buy three month Treasury
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:05.040]   Bills or maybe nine month Treasury bills because when you get your money back you can reinvest in an hopefully even higher rate
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.200]   Now in a declining interest rate environment or a potentially declining interest rate environment
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.760]   You want to go a little bit longer on the yield curve?
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:21.840]   maybe you get a one-year two-year or three-year Treasury bond with a higher yield and that way you can lock in that higher rate so as
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:29.380]   Inflation and interest rates decline over the years. You'll be sitting pretty your bond will increase in value and your real
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.120]   Yield will also grow so before you buy a Treasury bond
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.440]   You should have a buying strategy based on your liquidity needs
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.680]   financial goals
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.560]   Existing net worth asset allocation and your inflation forecast
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.440]   So we just talked about inflation forecast, which it's not really that easy to figure out
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:56.720]   But we need an opinion before we buy a Treasury bill or Treasury bond at a certain duration for the lowest risk
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.680]   easiest
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:05.120]   No-brainer strategy to buying Treasury bonds is to buy the shortest duration Treasury bond available this way
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:11.600]   You have minimal liquidity risk and you can always buy more short-term Treasury bills at their latest rates
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.960]   So in other words, you can just keep on buying three month Treasury bills
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:22.440]   You're gonna get a lower yield but after three months you can just buy again and you can keep on rolling that and you'll have
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.800]   No real liquidity risk, especially after three months if you're buying
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:32.920]   Three month bills every month. The thing is eventually greed starts taking over. We're thinking to ourselves
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:40.200]   Well, why buy a three-month Treasury bill with a three point five one percent yield when I could get four point four five percent
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.880]   On a three-year Treasury bond. It's a pretty big difference
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:51.000]   especially if you have a significant amount of cash if you are unsure about the future macroeconomic environment as
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.800]   Most of us are you can simply hedge by buying a variety of Treasury bond durations
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:04.680]   Let's say you have two hundred fifty thousand in cash with enough cash flow every month to cover your monthly living expenses by at least 2x
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.720]   So with a 70% conviction level as I discuss in my book buy this not that
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:18.080]   You believe inflation has peaked in one year's time. You believe headline inflation will drop from 8% today to 3.5%
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.400]   You also want to upgrade your home in three years
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:28.880]   Here's what you could buy out of the 250,000 you have a hundred thousand worth of three-year Treasury bonds
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.120]   Yielding four point four percent because you have strong monthly cash flow
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:39.800]   You don't need the 250,000 you match 40% of your cash hoard with your liquidity needs to get the highest
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.080]   Yield possible at the time
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:49.920]   Then you buy 50,000 worth of two-year Treasury bonds yielding four point three one percent that zero point seven percent spread is
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.960]   Insignificant you're not gonna even notice it
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:15:01.640]   So you buy two years instead of three years because just in case you find an upgrade home in two years
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.520]   You want that liquidity so you can go buy it
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.160]   Then you buy 50,000 worth of nine-month Treasury bills yielding four point one three percent
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:17.040]   Psychologically you like the idea of still getting a four percent plus yield while looking up your money for only nine months
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.840]   Given there's still a chance. Let's say 30%
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:25.960]   Inflation could stay elevated for longer. You want your money back sooner this way
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.920]   You can reinvest in a potentially higher yielding Treasury bill or bond in nine months
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:37.360]   And then finally you buy 50,000 worth of three-month Treasury bills yielding three point five three percent
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:45.200]   Although you're not getting a more attractive four percent yield you get greater peace of mind knowing you get your money back after only three
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.800]   months just in case rates continue to rise
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:53.160]   You can reinvest at a higher rate anything can happen during this most uncertain time
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:59.000]   We all know this so it's always nice to stay liquid in conclusion the year
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.120]   2022 will unfortunately go down as one of the worst years ever for the bond market as a result
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:12.440]   Buying Treasury bonds now actually looks very enticing. Hopefully not many of us were buying bonds in
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.640]   2020 or 2021
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:22.920]   Because the yields were pitiful in 2020. We're talking about zero point six percent on the 10-year bond yield
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.680]   So why would you bother buying that?
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.920]   receiving only such a low yield and
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:34.640]   Facing a risk that bonds could sell off if interest rates rise and that's what we've all seen
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:40.520]   And is this revisionist history is this you know, looking back 2020 and saying oh, well, of course
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.600]   We should have done that or could have done that
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:49.680]   Not really because we've been talking about this for years how bomb didn't seem attractive one or two years ago
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:56.080]   But it's all about thinking about what next what now in my humble opinion
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:01.920]   Buying any Treasury bill or bond with a yield greater than four percent is attractive
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.600]   I would go up to three-year duration where you can get around four point four percent
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:13.600]   Because that's 15 plus year highs and if inflation does roll over over the next one to two years
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.320]   You're gonna be sitting pretty with a three-year Treasury bond yielding four point four percent
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.840]   And here's an argument for why you might want to buy even longer
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:28.460]   Duration Treasury bonds in five years ten years twenty years also yielding over four percent
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:35.840]   Because of future expected returns we know in a previous episode and in a previous post how I discussed
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.680]   Mmm lower future expected returns from Vanguard and other houses. For example
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:47.160]   Vanguard expects four point oh two percent annual returns for stocks over the next ten years
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:53.160]   Bonds expectation is one point three one percent per year over the next ten years
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:18:01.440]   That seems pretty low. But if those are real if they turn out to be real then locking in a risk-free
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.640]   Ten-year Treasury bond yielding four percent is a no-brainer
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:13.800]   Now unfortunately, nobody knows the future so Vanguard could be totally wrong. So could many other investment houses?
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:21.040]   But what I do know is that getting a four percent plus risk-free rate of return without having to pay state taxes is attractive
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:26.720]   I love the concept of living for free and if the Fed insists on crushing the economy
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:33.400]   We might as well take advantage and earn a higher risk-free rate return on our cash
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:39.920]   The biggest hurdle we have to overcome is probably greed and slashing hope, you know
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:47.020]   We have greed and we have hope that ten percent historical return averages for stocks could return again
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:54.900]   Yeah, they very well could so to be able to buy bonds means to be able to be okay with having lower return rates
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:02.200]   And it depends on where you are in the journey if you are retired you're looking at principal protection capital preservation
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.280]   Then all the more reason to buy
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:11.520]   US Treasury bonds with a yield of over four percent if you're still young in your 20s and your 30s and you're trying to take
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:17.820]   More risk and build your capital nut then locking your money away risk-free for four percent plus
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.220]   May not be that attractive. Alright, that's it folks
