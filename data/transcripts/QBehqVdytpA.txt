[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Well, did Bathsheba sin with David?
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.520]   Was she complicit in the sin, or was she simply taken advantage of?
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.640]   It's an important Bible question, one that I see pop up on social media every now and
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.640]   again.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.060]   Of course, it's also a sensitive question, too, so a heads up to those of you who listen
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.600]   with kids around.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.800]   The particular question this time arrived recently in the inbox from a listener named
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.480]   Micah, who lives in Toronto.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.560]   Micah asks this, "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.680]   I have a delicate Bible question I have been thinking about for a long time about the misuse
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.060]   of a woman.
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.920]   Back in APJ 234, you came right out and said that Bathsheba was raped by King David, a
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.200]   violation that went against her will.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.120]   Most Bible scholars I read today leave the situation more vague and simply say that David
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.360]   committed adultery with her, leaving her volition ambiguous, maybe even suggesting that she
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.480]   was a willing participant in the sin.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.080]   Is there any evidence in the Bible text of whether Bathsheba was willing or unwilling?
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.040]   And from what I hear from feminists on the text, his power as a male king over her, a
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.120]   subject, would immediately classify this as a rape even if she put up no resistance herself.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.560]   Are there any pointers for us in the text itself?"
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:33.560]   Yes, I think there are pointers that David exerted a kind of pressure on her to warrant
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.880]   the accusation of rape.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:45.640]   And I don't say that because I think the act couldn't be consensual given the power dynamics
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.640]   at play.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:55.160]   It is possible for a woman to be sinfully complicit in committing adultery with a very
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.280]   powerful man.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.560]   I don't see any evidence for that in this text.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.960]   On the contrary, I see two indications that David threw his weight around, threw his power,
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.760]   his influence, his position, threw it around in such a way as to force her, apart from
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.600]   and against her commitment to her husband, to have sex with him.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.800]   So here's the first pointer that I see in the way the story itself is narrated, 2 Samuel
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   11, 2-4.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.080]   Here's what it says.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.880]   It happened late one afternoon when David rose from his couch and was walking on the
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.760]   roof of the king's house that he saw from the roof a woman bathing.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.640]   And the woman was very beautiful.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.240]   And David sent and inquired about the woman.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:54.080]   And one said, "Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   So David sent messengers and took her.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.680]   And she came to him, and he lay with her.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.080]   He didn't invite her.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.040]   He didn't woo her.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.200]   He didn't lure her.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.960]   He didn't trick her.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.960]   He took her.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.960]   That's what the text says.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.960]   He took her.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:21.480]   In other words, the description is of a completely one-sided, powerful exertion of his desire
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.120]   with no reckoning with hers.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.520]   Now here's the other pointer, and I think it's even more significant.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:38.200]   When the prophet Nathan is sent to rebuke David on behalf of God and confront him with
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:47.920]   his sin, you recall he did it by telling a parable to suck David in to giving his own
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.200]   self-condemnation, which he did.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.760]   The picture he creates is telling.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.360]   Here's what he said.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.980]   The Lord sent Nathan to David.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.120]   He came to him and said to him, "There were two men in a city, the rich one and the other
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.920]   poor one.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.840]   The rich man had very many flocks and herds.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.640]   The poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb which he had bought, and he brought it
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.720]   up and it grew up with him and with his children.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.560]   It used to eat his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms, and it was like a
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.120]   daughter to him.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.560]   Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:49.960]   flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him, but he took the poor man's
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.400]   lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him."
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.840]   Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, "As the
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.600]   Lord lives, the man who has done this deserves to die."
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.800]   I love Nathan.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:20.480]   Nathan did not have to create a parable in which there was a single harmless pet lamb
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:28.680]   who wasn't just taken, which it was, but was taken and killed and eaten.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:38.840]   In other words, he really recreated the adultery in the categories of theft and killing.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.120]   Not Uriah's killing.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.000]   That's an added evil.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.440]   But as it were, Bathsheba's killing, represented by the little helpless pet lambs being killed
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.320]   and served up as a meal.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:02.040]   So I would say for these two reasons, we are not exaggerating to use the word "rape"
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:12.440]   for David's abuse of his power in the indulgence of his sinful lust in the way he took Bathsheba.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.480]   But the Bible doesn't just leave us with pointers—and I think this just needs to
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.160]   be said before we stop—it doesn't just leave us with pointers to the reality and
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:31.760]   the danger and the sinfulness of the misuse of official authority or power in order to
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:38.920]   exploit or threaten or manipulate or mistreat or demean or destroy other people.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:46.900]   The New Testament is replete with warnings against a worldly use of authority.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:54.320]   It is replete with beautiful descriptions of what Christians who hold positions of influence
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.380]   and governance should be like.
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.580]   It starts with Jesus, it goes to Paul the Apostle, it goes to the elders of the churches,
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.660]   and it goes to husbands, and indeed it goes to all Christians because all Christians are
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:13.800]   influential one way or the other, and they can be influential in harmful ways or influential
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.160]   in helpful ways.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.760]   So let's just take a brief look at each of those stages.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:27.560]   Number one, not only did Jesus say that he came into the world not to be served but to
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:39.960]   serve and to give his life a ransom, he also taught about this issue of power and servanthood.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:46.760]   For example, he said, "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:52.140]   those in authority over them are called benefactors.
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:08:03.080]   But not so with you," his disciples, "rather let the greatest among you become as the youngest
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:10.560]   and the leader as one who serves, for who is greater, the one who reclines at table
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.080]   or one who serves?
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.480]   Is it not the one who reclines at table, and yet I am among you as one who serves?"
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.140]   Second, the apostles.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:31.700]   Jesus commissioned them to have foundational authority, tremendous authority in the church
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.700]   to teach, and if something that other people taught didn't conform to what the apostles
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.200]   taught, they were not acknowledged (1 Corinthians 14:38).
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:49.600]   And yet we get glimpse after glimpse into the way the apostle Paul and Peter and others
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.420]   used their authority by trying to set an example to the churches.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:01.680]   For example, 1 Thessalonians 2.5, "We never came with words of flattery, as you know,
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:08.000]   nor with a pretext for greed, God is witness, nor did we seek glory from people, whether
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.960]   from you or from others, though we could have made demands as apostles of Christ, but we
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:21.120]   were gentle instead, we were gentle among you, like a nurse, a nursing mother taking
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.360]   care of her own children."
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.720]   He acted exactly that same way with his authority toward Philemon when he wrote to him in Philemon
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:38.280]   1.8, he said, "Though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required,
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.780]   yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you."
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:48.320]   So that's the apostles picking up on Jesus' example and teaching.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.960]   And then comes elders.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:56.200]   Peter says concerning the elders, the pastors who have rightful governing leadership roles
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:02.560]   in the church, and he says to them in 1 Peter 5, "So I exhort the elders among you as a
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.640]   fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:12.560]   Shepherd the flock of God that is among you, not domineering over those in your charge,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.800]   but being examples to the flock."
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.560]   And then husbands.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.800]   Paul applies the same principle to husbands in Ephesians 5.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:28.080]   So after teaching that wives are to submit to husbands as their head in marriage, he
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.200]   tells the husbands how to use that headship, that authority, that leadership, and he says
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:39.960]   this, "As the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.760]   their husbands.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:50.020]   Husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her."
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.880]   So it starts with Jesus, it goes to the apostles, it goes to the pastors, it goes to the husbands,
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:02.020]   and now it lands finally on all Christians, because all of us can throw our weight around
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:09.600]   with somebody in order to exalt our egos and manipulate or abuse them.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:18.960]   So Paul says to every Christian, "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.720]   count others more significant than yourselves.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:31.640]   Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:37.420]   Have this mind among yourselves which is yours in Christ Jesus."
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.420]   So there it is.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.780]   It all circles back to Christ, which is yours in Christ Jesus.
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.360]   It all circles back to Christ.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:54.520]   The only hope that David would ever have that he could be forgiven and be happily in heaven
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:12:04.600]   with Uriah and Bathsheba and a holy God is that Jesus Christ lived and served and died
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.080]   in a way radically different than David.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:17.320]   All of us depend totally on the upside-down way that Jesus used his infinite power on
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.320]   the cross.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.320]   Yeah, amen.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.160]   And you can flip the genders on this whole topic too, with Potiphar's wife, a very powerful
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.160]   woman and predator.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.160]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.160]   That's right.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.160]   Amazing.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   Yeah, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.160]   And Micah, great question.
