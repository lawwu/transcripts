[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   The 17th chapter of the Gospel according to St. John and in the 17th verse.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   "Sanctify them through or in thy truth. Thy word is truth."
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   That is clearly, therefore, an indication of the method of sanctification as it is taught in the Scripture.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Now the question arises at once, what truth is this?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   "Sanctify them in thy truth."
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Well, our Lord answers the question, "Thy word is truth."
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   What word? Well, the whole of the word.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   In other words, everything that is in the Bible ministers to our sanctification.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   You can't read about God himself in his being and his person, truly, without its promoting your sanctification.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Every truth in the Scripture is a truth which is a part of sanctification.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   The doctrine of God, the doctrine of sin, the law of God, the doctrine of punishment and of judgment and of hell,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   all that is truth that points in the direction of sanctification.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   It is the whole truth.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   But, while that is perfectly true to say, it is also true to say
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   that there are certain statements in Scripture and certain sections of Scripture
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   in which this great doctrine concerning sanctification is dealt with in a very explicit and specific manner.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And, in many ways, the most striking illustration of that,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   what we may well call the locus classicus of biblical teaching with respect to sanctification,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   is undoubtedly chapter 6, 7 and 8 of the Epistle to the Romans.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Now, I do want to emphasize this.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   This isn't the only place where sanctification is dealt with.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Sanctification is to be found everywhere.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   But this goes out of its way to deal with it in an explicit manner.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And it does so, of course, because the apostle,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   having written what he had written in the first five chapters on the great doctrine of justification,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   takes up what he imagines to be a false deduction drawn from that by certain of the members of the church at Rome.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Indeed, he didn't require much imagination to do this,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   because there were many people who were drawing that very false deduction from the apostle's teaching.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   They charged him with being guilty of antinomianism,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   which means that the doctrine of justification says,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   "Well, because you are saved by Christ, it doesn't matter what you do."
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Now, the apostle writes these chapters in order to refute that terrible suggestion,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   which he dismisses with a sense of horror by saying, "God forbid."
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Now then, that is the point at which we've arrived,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   and I suggested that I would give you a general analysis of these three chapters.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Now, it can be nothing more than that.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I haven't the time, obviously, to deal with chapter 6, 7, and 8 of Romans in one address.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   God willing, when we finish these biblical doctrines,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   we may very well go on to consider this great epistle to the Romans in detail, as it should be considered.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   But I'm simply anxious tonight to give you a general outline of the teaching.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Well, very well then, the first thing we have to do is this,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   is to realize exactly what his argument is.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Now, the argument we can put in this form,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   the apostle is here out to show the utter impossibility of a Christian's continuing in sin.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And he says that it is impossible because of the nature of the Christian salvation.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   You see, he puts it in that question, "What shall we say then?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid!"
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   That's it. How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein? That's the thing.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   The impossibility, he puts it as strongly as that as I want to show you,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   of the Christian continuing in sin,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   the whole character and nature of the Christian salvation makes that quite impossible.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Indeed, if you like, we could say that the theme of Romans 6, 7, and 8 is this,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   is to denounce with horror the tendency of people to separate justification from sanctification.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   That's the whole message of chapter 6, 7, and 8 of Romans,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   to say that if you think you can stop at justification,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   you are doing something which the apostle says is so terrible that he can say nothing about it
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   but "God forbid that anybody should think such a thing or ever draw such a deduction."
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   So you see the vital importance of these great chapters.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Now, the argument is stated and summarized as a whole in chapter 6.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   He then works it out in greater detail in chapter 7 and 8.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Now, I do want to emphasize this again.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   There is no new principle introduced in chapter 8.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   The whole argument is stated in chapter 6.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   What you get in chapter 7 and 8 is simply greater detail.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Now, that is the most vital matter,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   because you know there are people who say that as a Christian you can stay in chapter 6 and 7
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   without going on to chapter 8.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Now, that I want to try to show you is really an extremely dangerous error.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   The whole thing is stated in chapter 6.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It is repeated and amplified in chapters 7 and 8.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Now, let me give you my evidence for making such a categorical statement.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   The apostle says something in chapter 8 which I think will substantiate my statement.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Listen, let me read to you verses 5 to 9 in chapter 8.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   "They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   because the carnal mind is enmity against God,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   So then they that are after the flesh cannot please God,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   but you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   If so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   now, if any men have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   You see what that means?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   In chapter 8, Paul is not describing some special Christian who has had some second blessing.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   He is describing any Christian, every Christian.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   "If any men," he says, "have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   If you haven't got the Spirit of Christ in you, says Paul, you're just not a Christian at all.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And he says of these people, "They are not carnal, they are not in the flesh, they are in the Spirit.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   They were before conversion in the flesh.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   But the moment you're converted, you're no longer in the flesh, you're in the Spirit."
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Is it conceivable that he can say of a man who's a Christian,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   "The carnally minded is death because the carnal mind is enmity against God"?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   That can't be true of any sort of Christian.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So here I say he is dealing not with some special Christians, but with all Christians.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   You are not a Christian at all unless you are in the Spirit and have the Spirit dwelling in you.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   From the moment of our rebirth and regeneration, we are in the Spirit.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   That is the vital point.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   We are united with Christ and we are in the Spirit.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Very well then, let me say it again.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Chapter 8 of the Epistle to the Romans is a description of all Christians,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   and not merely certain Christians who've gone on to some second blessing or some further experience.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   He is not introducing anything new, but recapitulating and explaining more fully what he has already said in chapter 6.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Now that to me is the most vital foundation.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   You will see from what we've considered on previous Fridays,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   that it is because people have not realized that,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   that they've gone astray in their understanding of sanctification.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   But surely those verses from 5 to 9 in chapter 8
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   ought to settle this question once and forever.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   The apostle there, I say, is dealing with all Christians.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   So you must no longer divide up Christians into those who are spiritual Christians and those who are not.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   All Christians are spiritual, of necessity by definition.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   The moment we are born again, we are spiritual.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   We have received the Holy Spirit, we are united to Christ.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   The nature of God is in us, we are partakers of the divine nature.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Very well.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Now then, having put it like that in general, to give you a sort of summary of the whole teaching,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   let us look at it a little more in detail.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   What is the teaching, therefore?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   What is this argument of his?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Because it is an argument in these three chapters on this question of sanctification.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Now, to answer that, we must start way back with the doctrine of sin.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   The apostle himself has done that in the second half of the previous chapter, chapter 5.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   You remember chapter 5, don't you?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Where he teaches that we were all in Adam,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   and that because we were all in Adam, we all fell with Adam,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   and we have all reaped the full consequences of the sin of Adam.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   What are the consequences of the sin of Adam?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   The consequences of the sin of Adam are these.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Man, as the result of the fall of Adam, is dominated, he is controlled by sin and Satan.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Many, many months ago, we went into that in great detail, the consequences of the fall.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   We have this sinful nature.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Our lives are dominated by the body.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Instead of our controlling the body and the bodily parts by our spirit, which is in tune with God,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   we have lost that alignment with God,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   and our whole life is dominated by the body and the sinful principle that controls the body.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Now, that is what sin has done.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   You see, before the fall, man worked in a perfectly harmonious manner.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   He had got all his instincts, the hunger instinct, the sex instinct, and all these things.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   They were all there in man.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Yes, but as man was perfect and in the right relationship to God,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   those didn't constitute any problem at all for him.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   The instincts in man before he fell were no trouble at all.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   They were all subservient to the highest and the best interests of man.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   But when man sinned and fell, that balance was completely upset,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   and man became the victim of his own body.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   He became governed by what Paul calls in the second chapter of Ephesians,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   "the lusts of the flesh and of the mind."
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   He has become a creature of lust, dominated by sin and Satan.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   That is the biblical teaching.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Now then, man then, as a result of the fall and of sin, has suffered in the whole of his being,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   his spirit and his body, the body and the spirit.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   The whole of man has fallen, and he is in this condition of confusion and of riot.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   But in Jesus Christ there is salvation.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   That's what he's saying at the second half of that fifth chapter of Romans.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   You remember the magnificent statement, "But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Now then, here is the salvation.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   But what is it? What sort of a salvation is it?
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Is it merely forgiveness of sins?
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And the answer is an eternal no.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   That's exactly the thing he begins to say at the beginning of chapter 6.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Some of these people, you see, he imagines saying something like this.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   "Ah, they said this is rather good.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   All our sins are covered by Christ. Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   It doesn't matter, therefore, how much we sin.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Indeed, we might even argue the more we sin, the more grace will abound.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   I know my sins are forgiven. It doesn't matter what I do.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   I'm in Christ. I'm safe. I can live any sort of life."
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   God forbids, says the apostle.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   That's the thing he's denouncing.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Why? Well, for this reason.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   That our salvation in Christ is not a partial salvation, it's an entire salvation.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   It's a complete salvation.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And what he sets out to do in this great passage in chapter 6, 7, and 8,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   is just to work out that theme and to prove it.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Now then, the great text, in my opinion, is the 14th verse in the 6th chapter.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Here it is.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   "For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace."
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   That's the text.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Observe what he says.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   He doesn't say that sin ought not to have dominion over you.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   He says sin shall not have dominion over you.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   It's not going to be allowed.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Because you are not under law but under grace, sin shall not have dominion over you.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   And he shows us how that comes to pass.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   How is this brought to pass?
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Well, the answer which he gives is this.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Fundamentally, the principle is, "Our union with Christ."
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   You remember we dealt with the doctrine of the union before,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   and that's why you've got to take that before you come to sanctification.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   The fundamental principle is, "Our union with Christ."
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Read again the second half of chapter 5 when you go home,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   and you'll see that the argument is, "As we were in Adam, so we are in Christ."
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   We've reaped all the consequences of what Adam did.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   We've reaped all the consequences of what Christ has done.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   That's the parallel.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   What does this mean?
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Well, we are joined to him in every respect.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Let me put it negatively by putting it like this.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   We are not only joined to the Lord Jesus Christ in some respects.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   We are joined to him entirely.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   You can't divide Christ.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   We've been crucified with him.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   You'll find it all in the sixth chapter.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   We've been crucified with him.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   We've died with him.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   We've been buried with him, planted in the likeness of his death.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   We've risen with him.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And go on to Ephesians 2 again,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   we are seated with him in the heavenly places at this very moment.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Yes, or put it in terms of 1 Corinthians 1.30.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us," what?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   "Wisdom," yes, "righteousness."
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   But you don't stop there.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   "Wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption."
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   He has made all that unto us who are Christians already.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Can you imagine anything, therefore, more dangerous or unscriptural
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   than to say that to some Christians Christ is only justification?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   He's not sanctification to them yet.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   They'll go on to that.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   But, my friends, the Scripture says the exact opposite.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   "He of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption."
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   You can't divide Christ.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   And we are in Christ and we are joined to Christ.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And we have a whole Christ always.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Very well, then, this is the thing which we have to grasp.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   What does that lead to?
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Well, the apostle's own deductions are these.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Because of our union with Christ and because we have been crucified and have died
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   and have been buried and have risen with him,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   he says you are dead to the law.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   The law no longer condemns you. It can't touch you.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Christ has died. Christ is the end of the law once and forever, first of all.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   So the law has nothing more to say to me by way of condemnation.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Yes, but you see, he doesn't stop there.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   The apostle tells us that we are not only dead to the law,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   but we are also and equally dead to sin.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Let me give you the verses.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Chapter 6, verse 2.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   God forbid, how shall we that are dead to sin?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Or if you prefer it, how shall we that have died to sin?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   It's as definite as that.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   It's the aorist tense.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   It's happened once and for all.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   It's in the past. It has taken place.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   We are not dying to sin. We are dead. We have died to sin.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   But he repeats it many times. Listen to verse 6.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Our old man has been crucified, was crucified.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   It's happened. He's gone.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Verse 7.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   For he that is dead is freed from sin.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   And that's the Christian.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Verse 18.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Being then made free from sin, he became the servant of righteousness.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Verse 22.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Being now made free from sin, which means having now therefore been made free from sin,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   and become the servants of God, ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   And then he puts it as a form of an appeal.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   You remember in verse 11.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Likewise reckon ye yourselves also to be dead indeed unto sin,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   and alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Very well then.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   We are not only dead to the Lord, but we are also dead to sin.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   As far as we are concerned, he says sin is no more.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   We are dead to it.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   He's got a great argument to prove that in the next chapter.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   The argument of a woman married to her husband, and the moment the husband is dead she's free.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   That's his own illustration.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   He puts it in the sixth chapter in the form of this argument,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   that you're a slave and you're owned by a master,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   but another one comes and buys you out, and then you don't belong to the first, you belong to the second.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   So that not only are we dead to sin, but more than that we are risen with Christ.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   And that means this, that Christ's life is our life.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Here are the verses for that.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Verse 4, "Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   even so we should walk in newness of life."
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   In verse 5 the same thing.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   "We have been planted together in the likeness of his death,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection."
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Same argument.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   And then in verse 8, "Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him."
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   That's really the present tense.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   We are living with him.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   This is true already of us.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And you get it also in verses 11 and 13,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   "Reckon yourself to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ."
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And in verse 13 he says, "Yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead."
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   We've risen with Christ and therefore we are in this new life.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And as I say in chapter 7, he puts it in this way.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   He says, "In a sense you were married to the Lord."
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   You're no longer married to the Lord because the Lord as far as you are concerned is dead.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   You are now married to Christ so that you may bring forth fruit unto him.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the Lord by the body of Christ,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   that we should bring forth fruit unto God."
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   We are married to Christ and we ought to bring forth the fruit,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   the children of a good and a sanctified life.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   That's his argument.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Now then, that is his fundamental statement.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Owing to our union with Christ, we are dead to sin in that way and alive unto God.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And the life of Christ is in us.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   And that is the position of every Christian.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Well, dear me, says someone, does that mean then that we are completely sinless and perfect?
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Has Christ done this to the entire man?
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Am I entirely finished with sin in every shape and form?
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   The answer he gives is no.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   All that I have just been saying is true and true of our spirits.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Our spirits are already entirely delivered from sin.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   I as a spirit and as a spiritual being am dead to sin.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   I have finished with it once and forever.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   But that is not true of my body.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Now then, you see the argument.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   The result of the fall of Adam and of sin, I say, was that the entire man has been involved,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   his spirit and his body.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   In our Christian salvation at this moment, my spirit is entirely redeemed.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   My body is not.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Let me give you my evidence for saying that.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   According to this teaching, our bodies are still subject to sin.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Our bodies are still dominated by sin and ruled and governed by sin.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Our bodies.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   I am not because I am dead to sin, I finished with it.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   But my body still is under the dominion of sin.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Christ has redeemed my spirit perfectly.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   That is the new man.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   But my body still remains under the thralldom of sin as the result of the fall.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Let me give you the evidence.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   First of all, in chapter 6, you have got it in verse 6.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him that, in order that the body of sin might be destroyed."
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   The old man has been crucified. He has finished with it.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Yes, in order that this body of sin might be destroyed.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   That has not yet happened.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   But look at verse 12.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof."
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   He said, "You yourself have reckoned yourself to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God."
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Very well then, "Let not sin therefore reign, as it has been doing, in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof."
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   But go on to verse 13.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   "Neither yield ye your members," that is to say my instincts and my limbs, my faculties and all I am.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   "Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin."
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   But he tells us to yield them rather as instruments of righteousness unto God.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   And then there is the final statement of it in the 19th verse.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   He says, "I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   For as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and unto iniquity,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   even so now yield your members servants to righteousness and to holiness."
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   There is the evidence in chapter 6 to the effect that though my spirit is emancipated and redeemed, my body still is not.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   But let me give you the evidence in chapter 7.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   First of all in verse 17.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   He says in verse 16, "If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good."
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Then verse 17, "Now then, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   You see it isn't I, I'm redeemed, it's sin that dwelleth in me.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Verse 18, listen, "For I know that in me," then in brackets that is to say in my flesh, "dwelleth no good thing."
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   He will not say that in me there is no good thing, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Then again in verse 20 he says it, "Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Same thing you see.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   But go on to verse 23, "But I see another law in my members," not in me, "in my members,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into the captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   You see that is what happens, because of this sin that's in my members, unless I understand this doctrine,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   I myself will allow myself to be governed by that again.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   I needn't, but I do so.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   But you see the sin is in my members, not in me.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Then in verse 24, "O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Or if you prefer it, "O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death?"
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   You see it's a logical conclusion, isn't it?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   He's been saying this is my position, I am saved and redeemed.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Yes, but I'm still in this body and this body is still under the dominion of sin and it's trying to drag me down.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   "Who shall deliver me out of this body? How can I be perfectly emancipated?"
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   That's his question.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   And indeed he puts it again in the last bit of verse 25,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   "So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of darkness, but with the flesh the law of sin."
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   There it is in chapter 7. Let me give you the evidence in chapter 8.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   First of all it's in verse 10, one of the most important verses of all.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Listen to this.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   The 10th verse of the 8th chapter.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   "And if Christ be in you, the body," and he means the body, he doesn't mean the flesh, he means the physical frame, the soma,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   "the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness."
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   He has said, "He is not in the flesh but in the spirit, if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you."
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Now if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   "And if Christ be in you," that's your position as a Christian, what's true of you?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Well it's this, the body is dead, dead spiritually, because of sin,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   but the spirit is life because of righteousness.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   You see the distinction? I myself am alive, my body is still dead.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Verse 13, he says it again, "If ye live after the flesh ye shall die,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live."
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   He doesn't say to mortify yourself, he says to mortify the deeds of your body,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   the place in which sin is dwelling, you shall live if you do that.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And then there is the great verse at the end, summing it all up, verse 23.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   He's talking about the whole creation groaning and travailing in pain together until now,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   and listen, "And not only they, but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption."
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   What's that? Here's the answer, "To wit, the redemption of our body."
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Do you see what he's saying? Here I am as a Christian, my spirit is already redeemed,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   but my body isn't. And what I'm waiting for is the day which is coming
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   when my body shall be redeemed as well as my spirit.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Because of sin and the fall of Adam, I've gone down spirit and body.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Christ has come in, he's already saved my spirit, the body is not yet redeemed,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   I'm waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of my body.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Well, what is our position, you ask?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Does that mean, therefore, that as Christians we are condemned to a life of hopeless struggling
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   and misery and failure and wretchedness in this world?
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Is that your teaching, sir, someone? You say my spirit is redeemed, but my body isn't?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Am I, therefore, just to go on struggling vainly and being down and out, as it were,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   and unhappy and miserable and wretched?
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   To wit, the answer is this.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Yes, you are condemned to that if you are relying only upon yourself
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   and your own ability and energy to conform to God's law.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Yes, you are condemned to that if you draw a separation between justification and sanctification.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Yes, you are condemned to that, perchance, if you say that a Christian can have his sins forgiven but nothing more.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   But the answer of the Scripture is a thousand times that that is not our position.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Now, the meaning of the great statement in chapter 7, from verse 7 to the end of the chapter,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   which people have argued about so often as to whether it describes a man unredeemed altogether
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   or a man who is redeemed but not yet sanctified or the fully sanctified man,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   the whole point of that passage is just this.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Paul has been saying, in the first part of chapter 7, that we are no longer under the law.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   We are like the woman whose husband is dead and she is free to be married to another.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   We are no longer tied up with the law because Christ has put an end to the law through his body
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   and we are now married to Christ and are finished with the law in that sense.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   "Ah, well," says someone, "are you saying then that there is no value in the law of God?"
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   "Are you saying," says someone to Paul, "that the law of God is absolutely useless and there is no worth in it at all?"
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   "God forbids," says Paul.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   "The law itself is all right.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   But if you think that that law can either justify you or sanctify you, you are making a big mistake.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   If you are relying for ultimate deliverance from sin to your own attempts to carry out that law,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   well, then you are indeed doomed."
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   And then he puts it in his typical dramatic way.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   He says, "Look here, you are leaving me in this sort of position,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   that I have now seen as a Christian the value of the law and I want to keep it.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   But this body of mine is dragging me down. This sin that remains in my body and in my members is making that impossible.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   And if that is the whole truth, well, then I am a failure. I am a wretched man."
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   But Paul says that is not the position.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   You notice how he put it.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   He makes his statement, "I, O wretched man that I am,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   who shall deliver me from this body of death?"
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   And immediately answers his own question,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   The whole thing he has been saying in summary in chapter 6 has already answered the question.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I am not condemned to that because of my union with Christ.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   And because of my union with Christ's sin shall not have dominion over me.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   It won't be allowed to. And indeed it doesn't.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Very well, then, Paul has answered the question, I say, there, first and foremost.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   In chapter 6, verse 14.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   But you notice how he likes to repeat it.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Having said it there in chapter 6, verse 14, he repeats it, I say, in chapter 7, verse 25,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   "I thank God through Jesus Christ my Lord."
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   He then goes on to say it in a most extraordinary way in verse 11 of chapter 8.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Listen, "If Christ be in you, the body is dead still because of sin.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   But the spirit is life because of righteousness then.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken you,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   and mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you."
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Now that not only refers to the resurrection that is coming,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   it refers to something that's already happening in these mortal bodies.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   The process is going on already.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   What a wonderful statement.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   He then repeats it again in much the same way in verses 15 to 17.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   He says, "You have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   You mustn't be cast down. You mustn't say this is a weary pilgrimage,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   and all is against me, and I'm constantly..."
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Not at all. "Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father!'
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   And the spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are children of God,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joined heirs with Christ,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   the ultimate result is certain and safe and assured."
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   And then I say he finally says it again in that 23rd verse.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   "We ourselves also groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption."
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   It's coming.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   The redemption of our bodies.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Now then, so that we are not doomed to a sense of failure and frustration,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   we are not struggling vainly and hopelessly and helplessly.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   This great process, because we are in Christ, is proceeding.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   How does it go on? Well, here it is.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ is in us. Christ is in us.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   If we are Christians, he is in us.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   And he is working in us by his Holy Spirit.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   And as the result of this working, he has already delivered our spirits,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   and he is in process of delivering even our bodies,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   and finally they will be perfectly delivered.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   How does the process go on?
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Well, Philippians 2.13 gives the right answer.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do."
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   The Holy Spirit works upon our wills.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   He creates desires after holiness.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   He reveals sin to us in all its foulness and ugliness,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   and creates aspirations after purity and the life of God.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Not only that, he gives us strength and power,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   and enabling to do what we now want to do.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   What else? Well, as Paul tells us in the 14th verse of the 8th chapter,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   And that is true again of every single Christian.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   The Spirit is in him, and he is led by the Spirit in the way I've just been describing.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   How does that happen? What does he lead us to?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Well, he leads us to the truth.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   He leads us in many ways, but he leads us particularly through the truth.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   It is he who is the author of the truth.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   He leads us to the truth. He gives us an understanding of the truth.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   And as he does so, we are being sanctified.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   What is the truth?
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Well, the truth that I've already outlined to you this evening.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   We are to see that we are already redeemed as spirits,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   that the problem remains in this body.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   We are to see that even that eventually is going to be delivered.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   What do we do in the meantime?
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Well, he shows us, "Reckon yourselves indeed to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God."
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   He gives this assurance and confidence and certainty of ultimate victory.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   I no longer feel defeated. I know that I'm on the victorious side and that I must just go on.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Then he gives an appeal to me.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   He says, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body."
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   And I feel that's a perfectly fair appeal, and I'm going to put it into practice.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   He says, "Don't yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, in view of all this,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   but yield them as instruments of righteousness unto God."
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Quite right, I say.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   And so he goes on to make this great appeal to us,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   to refuse to allow this body only which still remains unredeemed to dominate me as it used to.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   I must turn upon it. I must realize that I'm a son, a child of God, destined for this glory,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   and I mustn't allow this to influence me.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   That is the process. It is progressive, and it goes on and on and on.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   It is not complete while I'm still in this life and in this world.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Sin still remains in the body.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   It isn't complete yet, but thank God the day is coming when it will be complete.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   I must quote it once again because it's one of the most glorious verses in Scripture,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   the 23rd verse of the 8th chapter.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   "And not only they, but we ourselves also, groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   There is a day coming when my very body shall be delivered entirely and completely from sin in every shape and form.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   He shall change this, the body of my humiliation, and fashion it like unto the body of his own glorification."
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   It's coming. It isn't true yet of me. I'm still in the body.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   I'm waiting for that day with the whole creation waiting likewise.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   "There is a day coming when this process of redemption started in me by Christ,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   which has already delivered me as a spiritual being and has made me dead to sin.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   There is a day when my body shall be equally dead to sin, and I shall be perfect and entire,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   faultless and blameless, without spot and blemish, standing face to face with God."
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   "Beloved," says John, who agrees entirely with Paul, "Beloved, now are we the sons of God.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Now it does not yet appear what we shall be.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   But we know that when he doth appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   and we'll be like him in this respect, that not only will our spirits then be like him,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   and partaking of his nature, and reflecting his image,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   our bodies also shall be as glorified as his body.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is."
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   That's what's coming, and it's coming for certain.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   What of it, therefore?
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   "Well, while I'm still in this life and in this world,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   I shall still have to wage this battle against the sin that's in my body."
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   So John puts it like this, "Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself."
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   He does it, even as he is pure.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   "I keep under my body," says Paul again.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   He does it.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   He doesn't just passively look to Christ.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   "I keep under my body.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   I mortify my members that are on the earth."
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   That's the argument.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   "Given all this truth, this power of the Spirit working in me,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   I am exhorted to do that, and I want to do that, and that is sanctification."
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   So you see, that we must of necessity reject all talk about eradication of sin,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   all talk of being delivered entirely from sin in this life and in this world.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   We reject it in the name of this Scripture.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   We reject equally the talk that what is happening is a principle of counteraction coming in,
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   because that doesn't say enough about me.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   It doesn't tell me that I spiritually am already delivered,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   and that the problem is only in the flesh,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   and that that is a problem which I have to face.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   It draws that false distinction between a Christian who may only be in the seventh of Romans
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   with the one who is in the eighth,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   because he doesn't realize that every Christian is in the eighth of Romans,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   because if the Spirit of Christ is not in you, you are none of his.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   And therefore we see it as a part of this great and glorious plan.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Christ, the redemption.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   The believer joined to Christ.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   And from the moment of that union, the rebirth, the regeneration, and the union,
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   this mighty process begins,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   which eventually will lead to a perfected redemption and salvation,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   including even the barbarism, which hitherto,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   and until we die and are raised again,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   still remains under the dominion of sin.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   But as I realize this glorious truth,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   I should master it and conquer it more and more,
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   so that there should be a development and a growth and an advance in my sanctification.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Well, my friends, there it is.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   And we break off, as I say, at this point until the autumn.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   We have dealt thus with these doctrines leading up to sanctification.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   We shall have to go on to consider glorification
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   and other things which God has provided for our aid and help and encouragement,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   such as the sacraments and the church,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   while we are still left in this life and in this world with sin in our bodies,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   but our spirits eternally safe,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   dead indeed unto sin as well as to the law.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   May God bless you in the meantime
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   and give us all increasing understanding in this glorious and wealthy doctrine,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   by which alone we can be made truly free.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Let us pray.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, we do indeed thank Thee
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   for this glorious liberating truth,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   for this realization that we are indeed dead unto sin
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   and alive unto Thee,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   and that the day is even coming when our very bodies
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   shall be fully and completely redeemed,
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   and we shall stand whole and entire in Thy holy presence.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   O God, we thank Thee for the gift of Thy scripture.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   We thank Thee for the gift of the Spirit
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   with His anointing and His anointing and His illumination.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Lord, lead us into the truth more and more.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   O God, grant that we may so see it,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   that we shall indeed hunger and thirst after righteousness
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   and therefore be filled with it.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   O God, forbid it or prohibit it
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   that any one of us should be content
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   with a mere theoretical knowledge of these things.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   Indeed, we thank Thee that we know that that is impossible,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   that truly to realize this truth
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   means that we shall purify ourselves,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   even as He is pure.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Bless Thy faithful servants, we pray Thee,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   and all who are dear to them.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Bless them in their homes, in their work, in their witness,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   wherever they are.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   Grant that we all may appear before men
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   as indeed Thy sons, Thy children,
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   enjoying the glorious liberty of the children of God,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   that we may be the means of convicting others of sin and shame
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   and of leading them unto the same blessed Lord
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   who has set us free.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   Lord, bless us to that end.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   and the love of God
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   abide and continue with us
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   now throughout the remainder of this hour's short,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   uncertain life and earthly pilgrimage
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   and until the day of the grand redemption,
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   the adoption,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   to wit, the redemption of our bodies.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Amen.
