[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.880]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.200]   And before we begin, if you haven't already,

[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.320]   Today's email comes in to us
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.200]   from a young podcast listener named Austin,
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.640]   who writes this, "Dear Pastor John,
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.920]   "I'm 17 and I have terminal cancer.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.740]   "Doctors say my cancer will come back
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.840]   "and that my body cannot handle any more chemo
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.160]   "or bone marrow transplants.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.280]   "God has used the past five years of fighting it
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.520]   "to bring me closer to him and to use my situation
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.360]   "to bring a few people closer to himself as well.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.920]   "But I'm getting weary and I'm ready to go home.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.120]   "I don't like to admit it,
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.940]   "but I pray that God would take me home,
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.440]   "but he keeps sustaining me.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.380]   "His answer is clearly no or not yet.
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.460]   "How do I keep my joy even when life is hard and painful?"
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.180]   I feel like when I approach this question,
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.920]   it's entering into holy ground.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.340]   What I mean by that is ground just outside heaven.
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.460]   This is like a step away from heaven.
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.160]   I'm standing here on the edge
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.340]   and heaven has made this ground holy.
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.540]   It's like giving advice just outside the door
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.780]   of God's temple and he can hear what I'm saying.
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.400]   Of course, he can hear what I'm saying all the time,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.220]   but there's something sacred about talking to someone
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.240]   who is likely about to stand before Jesus
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.620]   in a very short time.
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.620]   So I want Austin to know that my faith is strengthened
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.720]   and my love for God is intensified
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.820]   in hearing him ask the way he asks.
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.820]   Mainly because you, Austin, have not expressed anger
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.940]   and bitterness towards God.
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.800]   You may have had at some time,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.880]   and of course he can handle that, but you didn't.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.120]   You seem to speak with remarkable faith.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.640]   And so you have the aroma of heaven already on you
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.640]   and that's mighty strengthening to me.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.260]   So let me just focus on your last words.
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.180]   You say, "I'm getting weary and I'm ready to go home.
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.220]   "I don't like to admit it,
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.300]   "but I pray that God would take me home."
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.300]   But he keeps sustaining me.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.620]   His answer is clearly no or not yet.
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.620]   How do I keep my joy when my life is hard and painful?
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.440]   And maybe the first thing, the first encouraging thing,
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.580]   I hope, that I can say is that you don't need
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.580]   to be embarrassed to admit that you are praying
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.900]   that God would take you home.
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.780]   At least you don't have to be embarrassed around me.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.060]   I have prayed that many times
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.780]   and have offered to go more times than I have prayed to go
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.940]   if it would be of greater effect than my life would be.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.460]   Lord, I give myself to you.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.140]   You know what I long for in my life.
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.500]   If not having my life would help that come about,
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.920]   I'm ready, take me out.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.820]   Frankly, Austin, I think that a person
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.860]   who has been a follower of Jesus for some time
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.020]   and has never prayed to go home to heaven with him
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.780]   either hasn't seen Jesus very clearly
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.780]   or has not been involved in much misery
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.980]   over our own and others' sins.
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.700]   Paul had zero shame in saying he wanted to die
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.020]   and be with Christ.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.900]   It's an honor to Christ to want to live this life
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.120]   and be with him.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.120]   But you, Austin, clearly are right in believing
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.020]   this is God's decision, not yours.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.540]   Suicide, assisted, merciful, or otherwise,
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.860]   is not just self-murder.
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.700]   It is role-reversing with God
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.360]   and your right to leave it with him.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.360]   So your great struggle is how to make it
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.140]   to God's appointed end, short or long,
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.900]   with joy when your life is painful.
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.400]   So let me just, there's so many things that could be said,
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.380]   but I'm gonna go with what's right on my front burner.
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.340]   I'm reading a biography of John Knox.
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.260]   I'm just gonna let John Knox finish this off.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.300]   When John Knox, the great reformer of Scotland,
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.980]   was dying in 1572, he asked his wife
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.780]   to read him two things.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.260]   First, he said, "Go to the place
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.860]   "where I first cast my anchor,"
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.700]   meaning the first sermons he preached were from John 17,
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.500]   and he meant these words.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.620]   Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.300]   "Father, the hour has come," namely, to die,
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.560]   "Glorify your Son, that the Son may glorify you,
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.460]   "since you have given him authority over all flesh,
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.460]   "to give eternal life to all whom you have given him.
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.260]   "And this is eternal life,
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.500]   "that they may know you the only true God,
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.540]   "and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent."
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.540]   And then he asked his wife to read him
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.460]   the sermons of John Calvin on the first chapter of Ephesians,
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.700]   especially verses three through six, which say this,
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.700]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.180]   "who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.940]   "in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.720]   "before the foundation of the world,
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.240]   "that we should be holy and blameless before him.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.480]   "In love he predestined us for adoption as sons
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.980]   "through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will,
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.920]   "to the praise of the glory of his grace."
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.920]   So Knox wanted to die with the rock of God's absolutely free,
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.920]   electing love and electing grace under his feet.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.600]   He wanted to hear from John 17, from the mouth of Jesus,
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   "I give eternal life to all whom you have given to me."
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.020]   He wanted to be reminded that God has chosen him
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.000]   and given him to the Son,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.320]   and the Son had authority infallibly to give eternal life
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.400]   to all whom God had chosen and given to the Son.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.560]   And he wanted to hear it from the apostle Paul,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.800]   that before the foundation of the world,
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.640]   he had been chosen under the praise
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.120]   of the glory of his grace.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.560]   I've never been in Austin's shoes,
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.560]   except for maybe a few weeks after a cancer diagnosis.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.000]   A few years ago, which turned out to be treatable.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   But John Knox walked in these very steps right to the end.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.640]   So maybe this simple glimpse into how he moved
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.080]   towards the presence of Jesus at the end will help.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.480]   Someone might say, "Well, how in the world
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.240]   "does the doctrine of unconditional election
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.160]   "help a person who's dying?"
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.560]   And my answer would be threefold.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.640]   Number one, nothing makes it clearer
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.640]   that no sin of mine could ever have been the ground
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.800]   of God refusing to choose me.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.440]   He chose me unconditionally,
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.100]   absolutely unconditionally before I was born.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:02.100]   Therefore, no foreseen sin could ever stop him
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.000]   from choosing me.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.480]   And number two, nothing makes it clearer
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.200]   that my salvation is by grace, all grace,
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.660]   all grace than that I was chosen
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.800]   before I had done anything good or evil
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.840]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.780]   And number three, nothing is deeper and stronger
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.480]   and more sure than the eternal purposes of God.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.920]   And that's the kind of rock we need
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.720]   at the moment of death.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.720]   So Father, I pray for Austin and others like him
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.640]   and all of us eventually
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.480]   who have been told our time is short.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.680]   Open to him, I pray, the door of heaven
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.600]   and let the light of your glorious sovereign grace
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.480]   lead him home.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.200]   Amen.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.360]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.760]   (silence)
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.920]   (silence)
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.080]   (silence)
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.140]   you
