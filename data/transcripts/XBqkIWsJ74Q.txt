[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Let's get started now with our deep dive, which I am calling "Work vs. Meaning."
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.200]   So this is something I've been thinking about a lot recently, is the history of our, let's
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:25.040]   call it, tumultuous, maybe, relationship between work and finding meaning in our lives.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.560]   I've been thinking through this history, mainly in the American context, going back to about
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.640]   the post-war period, so starting in the 1950s.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.120]   So what I've done is I've put together a timeline of what I think are the major milestones in
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.120]   our culture's evolving thinking about work and meaning, starting in the 1950s.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.720]   So if you're watching this episode on YouTube, so at youtube.com/calnewportmedia, you're
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.040]   going to see this timeline on the screen right now.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.880]   If you're just listening, don't worry, I'll walk you through what's on here.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.880]   So the first element of this timeline is the 1950s.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.160]   So in the 1950s, I call this the "Organization Man Period," which I describe as the period
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.200]   in which work is a substitute for civic life.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.880]   So if we look at this immediate post-war period, what you see is a move away post-war from
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.040]   urban living as well as, let's say, rural, countryside, agriculture-related living, much
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.960]   more of the rise of suburban living.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.080]   So as that occurred, people began looking towards their employers, which at this point
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.720]   were typically very large.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.240]   We had the rise of the very large corporation.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.920]   The US had emerged as a superpower.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.680]   Our country and economy had not been destroyed by war, so we had this 20-year period of just
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.240]   basically dominating every sector.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.080]   So we have these giant companies rising, these giant headquarters, and people moving to the
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.560]   suburbs, and the meaning they might have found before being involved in, let's say, civic
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.680]   leadership of the small town where they had a farm got transferred over to "my work is
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.000]   my family," "I'm very loyal to the company that I work for," "I will be there for my
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.840]   entire career."
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.960]   So I see this period as an expression of civic identity through work.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.040]   So that's the way we were thinking about work then.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.080]   Then we move to the 1960s, and we get the first backlash.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.760]   So we did the 1950s, so now we get to the 1960s, we get the first backlash, which I
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.080]   call the counterculture backlash.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.600]   So this is what we see in the beat movement followed by the hippie movement.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.080]   And the way I describe this is work is now conceived as an obstacle to meaning.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.520]   So the younger generation, the children of the World War II, the children of the greatest
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.000]   generation, so what's known as the baby boom generation, sort of had enough of this idea
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.160]   of the man in the flannel suit or organization man concept of, "I go and work at IBM my whole
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.580]   life and this is where I get a big sense of my civic meaning."
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.800]   So we get in the 1960s, a backlash in which work is seen as an obstacle to really figuring
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.560]   out meaningful lives.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.280]   So we had a lot more individualistic, utopian lifestyle experimentation happening.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.280]   This is where we had radical changes, let's say, in dress and attire, radical changes
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.920]   in living arrangements, we had communes, the back to nature movement, the voluntary simplicity
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.920]   movement.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.880]   So everything we associate with that Woodstock generation, I'm conceiving now my sort of
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.800]   simplified trajectory here as a backlash to the 1950s organization man period.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.000]   All right, so we're moving right along.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.320]   Now we get to the 1990s.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.580]   So this is when the older millennials like me or Jesse are in elementary school and junior
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.280]   high and high school, so sort of a formidable period for millennials.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.500]   And here we get the rise of what I call passion culture.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.840]   So I see this in some sense as the compromise that was created by our baby boomer parents.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.080]   So our baby boomer parents had rejected the really straight laced organization man model
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.800]   of their parents.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.040]   I get my sense of civic duty through a lifelong connection.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.640]   They went very counterculture.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.160]   Culture sort of fell apart in the 70s as drugs and sexually transmitted diseases sort of
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.320]   ripped that apart.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.800]   And so they found the compromise to teach to their children, which is this passion culture.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.540]   OK, you do have to work.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.560]   Don't go live on a commune and just engage in free love and a lot of hardcore drug use.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.680]   But your work can be your primary source of meaning.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.520]   Follow your passion.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.040]   This was the phrase that emerged in this period.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.000]   As I document in my 2012 book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.600]   Follow your passion emerges in this period.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.820]   We see its first appearances in the late 1980s and it's really in the 1990s that this idea
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.400]   that follow your passion is a good piece of career advice.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.700]   This emerges in the 1990s.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.240]   And so this is how I understand the passion culture period is basically the baby boomers
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.280]   trying to figure out how to balance between these two extremes of we don't want to be
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.120]   fully countercultural.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.120]   We know a lot of people that just burnt them out and kind of destroyed their lives.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.120]   But we don't want just everyone to put back on the flannel suits and commute out to the,
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.520]   you know, the headquarters and just have this soulless type corporate existence.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.160]   So what if work is your passion?
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.160]   So we got that culture.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.960]   I was raised on it.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.960]   You probably were you exposed to that a lot, Jesse, with the same age, the follow your
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.960]   passion, right?
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.960]   This was our childhood.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.480]   That and the interesting you go back 20 years, you're not seeing that you go back even 10
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.480]   years before us.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   You're not seeing a lot of that.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   So that rose in the 1990s.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.560]   All right.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.840]   So then we get a backlash.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.080]   See the cyclical nature of this movement backlash, new movement backlash.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:51.880]   So in the 2000s, we see this emerging in the first decade of the 2000s into the second
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.100]   decade of the 2000s.
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:01.120]   We get a new backlash, which I'm calling the minimalist slash fire slash lifestyle design
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.640]   backlash.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:09.760]   So I'm grouping together multiple movements that were all trying to do the same thing,
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.200]   which I describe as seeing work as a means to an end.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:22.900]   So this backlash, I think, got some fuel from various financial crises throughout this period.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:30.160]   You get the minimalist movement really comes out of that first dotcom boom and 9/11 recession
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.680]   in the early 2000s, and then you get the lifestyle design came at the tail end of that Tim Ferriss,
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.480]   the fire movement built on both of those.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.760]   That was sort of more 2008 financial collapse.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.040]   So it sort of emerged out of there.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.920]   So there's a series of financial issues in the economy and these issues, these movements
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.920]   came out of it.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.960]   So quick summary of each, I kind of have not quite in the right order here.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.200]   I think the minimalist movement was probably first.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:02.000]   We start getting this in the early 2000s and it's a move towards greatly simplifying your
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.360]   life.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.920]   And there was the sense that if you greatly simplify your life, then you don't have to
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.320]   be working all the time.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:17.260]   One of the best proponents of this movements are friends of the show, the minimalist Ryan
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:23.660]   and Joshua, who run the minimalist website and the excellent minimalist podcast.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.800]   They were in this early.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.000]   I've known them for a long time.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.760]   I think they're probably one of the best exemplars of this movement, but they have this great
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:36.840]   backstory about how they were, they were, you know, really overloading themselves with
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.840]   work.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.920]   Joshua, I think it was Joshua, maybe it was Ryan at some point had bought this massive
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.320]   house, even though they lived alone and it was full of boxes of stuff that they had boughten
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.360]   and they simplified everything.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.820]   There's a while there when I knew them where they lived in a cabin, they'd gone through
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.880]   different living arrangements, but minimalism was about simplifying your lifestyle and that
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.440]   indirectly connected to simplifying what resources you needed from work.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.280]   So simplifying your work life, lifestyle design came in that same milieu.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.680]   This is Tim Ferriss saying, let's be more systematic.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.680]   What you really want to do.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.720]   Why don't you go do these fun, like interesting experiences now in your life.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.240]   Don't wait to retire when you're in your sixties.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:24.400]   And you can do that if you're careful about remote work and geo arbitrage, earning money
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:30.860]   in euros while living in a South American country with a depressed currency, et cetera.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.540]   And then fire arose, financial independence, retire early.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:39.020]   That movement arose in the second decade of the two thousands that really started to pick
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.020]   up steam.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.020]   And that was this idea.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.860]   We've talked about it before on the show, where if you have a good salary and live very
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.940]   cheaply, you can save a lot of money, you're saving most of your salary.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.440]   And the amount of money you need to save to be financially independent is also small because
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.440]   you're living so cheaply.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.060]   So if you're willing to continue living so cheaply, it's possible in about 10 years.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.420]   And if I remember the math, right, if you have like a hundred thousand dollars, $150,000
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:11.740]   your tech job, and you're living on a quarter of it, something like this in 10 years, you're
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.300]   financially independent as long as you're willing to keep living cheaply.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.080]   So all of that was work as a means to an end.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:26.500]   So it's a reaction to the passion, the passion culture, which was saying work is your source
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.660]   of meaning.
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.220]   And this backlash that happened in the two thousands was saying, no, I'm going to go
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.020]   create my own meaningful life work just services that.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.300]   And so I'm going to figure out how work can service what I want in my life with a minimal
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.300]   footprint.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.140]   Again, each of these is pretty different.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:48.420]   Now we get more recently, we get to the 2020s, we get to the post pandemic period.
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:54.460]   And here I described the current moment as the sort of quiet quitting, anti-capitalist
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.820]   Twitter moment.
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.020]   So we talked about quiet quitting in a recent episode.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.260]   Anti-capitalism Twitter, this is really popular among the blue check sort of coastal crowd
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.540]   on Twitter.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:12.260]   Lots of tweets about, you know, we basically have to re-engineer capitalism or get rid
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.260]   of capitalism.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.400]   Work, all workers exploitative.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.540]   And why do we even have to work in the first place?
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:24.100]   And there's this sort of classic sort of early 20th century sort of leftist tinge to that.
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.500]   So here I described this move, this final movement as work as a target for online activism.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:36.060]   So it's work really being at the center of a conversation, the sort of online crowd based
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.660]   heavily in Twitter.
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.380]   All right.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.860]   So that's been the trajectory, 1950s to today.
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.980]   Movement backlash, movement backlash.
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.660]   What do I think about our current situation?
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:54.660]   Well, here is the bold claim I'm going to make is number one, I am going to call this
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:11:00.860]   current movement with some trepidation, this quiet quitting anti-capitalist Twitter movement
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.060]   a red herring.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:09.760]   Now I could be wrong about this, but this movement seems to be as much about the acquisition
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:19.180]   of social influence as it is a serious, I think, reform in the structure of work.
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:24.740]   It really is built around algorithmic reinforcement about what is getting views.
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.980]   I think this is a lot of what's driving quiet quitting.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.660]   We talked about this before.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:33.500]   There's some core frustrations which are very important, but also these TikTok videos are
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.020]   doing well.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.460]   So more and more people are going to do these TikTok videos.
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.180]   It's going to inflate then the influence of this idea.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.860]   Same thing with anti-capitalist Twitter.
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.540]   There's all these people on Twitter who are, you know, hey, all work is exploitative at
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:53.140]   the same time, desperately trying to get you to sign up for their sub stack and make a
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.580]   living doing online work.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:59.900]   I think a lot of this gets inflated when we throw in the reinforcement loops of algorithmic
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.180]   content curation.
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.940]   So I think that those particular movements might be a red herring.
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.780]   Again, more about what happens to be gaining social credibility online right now than it
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.560]   is maybe some sort of serious challenge to what work should be.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:21.700]   There's not really a clear, pragmatic, optimistic proposal for where we need to be, which is
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.980]   what we've seen in the past backlash movement.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.180]   So I'm going to put that aside for now again with trepidation, but I don't use Twitter.
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.320]   So to me, I don't run into this as much.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.120]   And I'm going to go back to the 2000s movement, the minimalist fire lifestyle design backlash
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:41.860]   movement, because what I think should happen and might happen next is instead of a brand
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:48.300]   new movement emerging, we're going to see a reform of what was broken about this work
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.700]   as a means to an end approach.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.540]   Because I think this is probably going to be the dominant approach for career thinking
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.500]   for the next 10 or 20 years.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.620]   There's just some corrections that we have to make.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:04.660]   So here was the issue with the existing work as a means to an end philosophy that emerged
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.660]   in the 2000s.
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:11.500]   It was too technical because it came out of tech circles, which makes sense because it
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:17.580]   was being spread in the early days of web 2.0, who was more comfortable with those technologies,
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.880]   tech savvy people.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:24.700]   So it came out of technical circles so that we get too much fiddly technical engineering
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.420]   detail.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.780]   Minimalism suffered from this.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.220]   I think the downfall, like why that movement deflated with the exception of a few exceptions
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.180]   like Josh and Ryan who are doing well, is that it got so fiddly about things like how
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:43.420]   many items you own, how many things can you fit into a backpack, what color do you have
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.060]   a white kitchen with just three appliances.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.020]   It got too obsessive over these technical details.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.500]   Fire had this same issue.
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:56.060]   Fire arose largely among engineering types because it was the engineering types who had
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.280]   the income in their 20s to actually put this type of plan into action.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:05.380]   Because the key to fire is you have to survive on a relatively small fraction of your income,
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.820]   roughly 20 to 30 percent.
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.140]   For that to really be possible, that first income has to be pretty big.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.860]   And so who's in the sweet spot of making a big income but not yet burdened with mortgages
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.180]   and families and school expenses and everything else that comes later in life is basically
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.300]   was computer programmers.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.660]   So the fire movement arose among computer programmers and it got super technical too.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:34.860]   It got super fiddly about tax loss harvesting and the exact right way to move your money
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.100]   around.
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:41.420]   And it really focused like a laser on the spreadsheets and on the mathematics of how
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.740]   you achieve this particular goal.
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.620]   So it got lost in its own specificity.
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.980]   And I think that was alienating to a broader audience and probably rightly so.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.680]   So I think that was the issue with fire.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.420]   And then as we talked about last week, it's been destabilized by that.
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.900]   And now even its proponents are trying to back away from it because it's under attack
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.660]   from the online crowds.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.900]   Like this is elitist, it's all just engineers.
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.180]   Everyone is just being privileged.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:13.100]   And so now they're kind of retreating and that's why that's losing steam.
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.300]   Lifestyle design sort of had the same issue.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.660]   Tim Ferriss will talk about this.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.740]   People got so fiddly in the details of lifestyle design.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:26.500]   I had a friend who knew Tim well, and I remember back then he was getting really into lifestyle
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.540]   design and it was all about the automation and the tech.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.540]   And he had the setup.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.540]   I remember this clearly.
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:38.340]   He was showing me, here's what's going to support me as I live.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.920]   He was living in Brazil, I think at the time.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.580]   You would click a button.
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.820]   There's no reason to automate this other than it was just a cool factor.
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:51.340]   You would click a button and it would somehow go through one of these Google AdSense tools
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.980]   to find keywords that were making a lot of money.
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:58.680]   Like people were bidding a lot of money to sell ads with those keywords.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:04.740]   It would then automatically send those keywords to copywriters in the Philippines, because
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:10.740]   I guess the Philippines, they have good English, to write a ton of pages for like HubSpot or
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.580]   one of these online page hosters that was big 10, 15 years ago.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.780]   That could then be a good receptacle for ads for those words.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.740]   And he was showing me some example of homemade rocking chair.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.540]   It was something like this.
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.220]   That is a word that people were bidding a lot of money on, because I guess there was
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.380]   particular people that sell plans for homemade rocking chairs and are willing to pay for
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.380]   those clicks.
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.980]   So then his copywriters in the Philippines would then write 50 pages of content about
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.260]   homemade rocking chairs with all these links so that they could get those ads on there
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.460]   and try to maximize their money.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:47.820]   And it was all this like minor arbitrage of $50 here, $100 there.
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:53.360]   That's what had that way down lifestyle design, too fiddly, too narrow, too technical, seemed
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.540]   too bro-y and it alienated sort of everyone else.
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:06.020]   My argument though is that this general approach, work as a means to an end, this general approach
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.100]   is salvageable.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:16.700]   And what I'm recommending, what I see salvaging this philosophy is introducing values into
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.700]   it.
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:23.820]   What I mean by this is starting before you get to the fiddliness, starting with a vision
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.320]   of a life well lived.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.080]   You cultivate your own understanding of the different aspects of your life, what you want
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.840]   your life to be like, what's important to you, what's your code, what's your definition
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.000]   of the deep life buckets, however you want to do this.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.060]   But you start with this image, this vision of the life well lived that you feel in your
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.720]   bones and resonates.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:49.740]   And then you work backwards and say, great, work services, work services this vision.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:55.040]   And then all of these ideas that arose in the early 2000s about if I live simpler or
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:00.960]   if I live cheaper and save at an expansive rate, or if I use some like automation or
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.900]   really leverage remote working like Ferris talked about, all of these tools are in a
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.400]   toolbox that you can start pulling out of, but you're not pulling out these tools just
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.260]   for the arbitrary exercise of building something to some specs that have become increasingly
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.440]   refined online.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:19.180]   You're building towards a life well lived, a vision of a life well lived that is specific
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.820]   and bespoke to you.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.200]   So this is what I think is going to happen.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.160]   Value based lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:34.480]   This is going to be, I think, the big corrective, not whatever this stuff is, is going on online,
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.700]   not this let's reform capitalism and do TikTok videos about quiet quitting, red herring.
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:45.320]   The next big movement, I think, is going to be that shift of what was the minimalist fire
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.040]   lifestyle design backlash that's going to evolve into look this long acronym I'm writing
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:56.460]   here, values based lifestyle centric career planning, VBLCCP.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.840]   If I'm anything, I'm a very savvy marketer.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.280]   We're going to hear that phrase all the time.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.280]   What's he up to, man?
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.280]   Hey, I'm just VBLCCP.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.280]   You know what's going on?
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.480]   Like, yeah, I hear you, man.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.220]   I'm in a VBLCCP life.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.220]   We need a better acronym.
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:16.380]   But I think that is what Gen Z, I think that is what is going to fuel Gen Z.
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.620]   I think this is what's compatible with Gen Z.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.300]   I think this is going to be the next, I don't know how long it'll last.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.380]   I think this is going to be the next big movement.
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:28.620]   It's also, of course, the philosophy that we're preaching all the time.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.620]   So we'll get more into this.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.340]   We have some questions in today's show that will dive into some more technical details.
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.820]   But I just wanted to do this overview.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.380]   Let's place our current discussions in this long trajectory.
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.480]   And what we see, we see movements, backlashes, movement, backlashes.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.340]   And I think we're in this interesting time where we're taking a backlash that emerged
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.500]   over the last 20 years.
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.720]   And with perhaps the help of the pandemic and disruptions that caused and the way that
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:54.260]   that mainstreamed the idea of lifestyle design and engineering, maybe we're going to see
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.940]   a refinement of a backlash and finally get one that might actually have some legs.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.420]   So VBLCCP, value space, lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.220]   Take my word for it.
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:10.460]   That is going to hopefully be one of the dominant ideas in the ongoing debate between work and
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.360]   meaning in the years ahead.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.660]   Was the organization, man, that going on in the 40s and 30s too?
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.340]   I mean, it was a book.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.300]   So I'm taking that from the book that came out in 1956.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.680]   And I think it's post-war.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:34.680]   I think really you don't get these large corporations and people subjugating their sense of civic
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   worth to corporations.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.280]   I think that's really like a mid 40s and on type of phenomenon.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.360]   Though I could be wrong about that.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.280]   So then the counterculture backlash lasted for a good 30 years?
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.360]   Let's say that picked up steam mid 60s.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.080]   I don't know, not really 30 years.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.840]   I see the counterculture backlash picked up steam in the mid 60s.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.340]   I mean, you had the beat movement emerging in the late 50s.
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.880]   That doesn't really start to catch on wider until the 60s.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.800]   Mid 60s, you get the bigger countercultural backlash.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.360]   Vietnam, of course, like explodes the whole thing because now you have this huge sort
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.760]   of generational divide and protests going on.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.320]   But I think by the disco era that had kind of flamed out.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.400]   I mean, a few things happened, right?
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:22.680]   I mean, sexually transmitted diseases, drugs, like the mind, you know, people started having
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.880]   LSD freakouts.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.480]   Like the things were happening with the drugs that weren't happening before.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.240]   So I think that was that became a big part of it.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.080]   Like people were burning out and frying out.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.640]   And so by the disco era, by the late 70s, that was really dying out.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:42.480]   And then the 80s, you got this sort of rise of let's all go make money.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.560]   And that was going on.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.560]   And then but it was the same.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.560]   It was the same generation.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:50.320]   The yuppies were the same people who were part of the counterculture backlash.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.840]   So they kind of ended up going and making money.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.280]   And I think they were guilty about this.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.320]   So for us, they taught us, well, don't be a hippie, but get a job you love.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.220]   And so I really think that was just the compromise.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.220]   And I wrote a whole book.
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.640]   So if you're new to the show or new to me, my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You is
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:10.280]   a takedown of the passion culture idea, why it doesn't work, why just telling someone
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.760]   to follow your passion is not a sound bit of career advice.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.960]   It sounded good, but it doesn't work in practice.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.440]   We'll see.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.440]   And there could be something else new.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.280]   But I think there's a lot of power to this work as a means to an end model.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.840]   And I haven't really seen a major alternative.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.920]   A lot of the stuff I'm seeing that's gaining traction, people resonating with people is
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.240]   really still in this framework.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:38.120]   I think people are just refining it, trying to understand how to get away from, you know,
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:42.480]   computer engineers doing spreadsheets about their admiral shares in Vanguard and what
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.520]   their overhead fees are and get towards something that the rest of us might actually see as
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.520]   viable.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.020]   Thank you.
