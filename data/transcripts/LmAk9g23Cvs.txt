[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast. Ryan, a podcast listener, writes in
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.360]   to say this. "Hello Tony and Pastor John. I am a frequent listener of the podcast
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.480]   from Northern Ireland and I find all of the resources at DesiringGod.org to be
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.360]   extremely helpful and insightful in my walk with Christ. My question is about
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.360]   God regretting his decisions. Two times the Bible says that God regretted
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.040]   something that he had done in the past, and in at least 15 places the Bible says
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.120]   that he regretted or that he might regret something he was about to do in
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.020]   the future. Now I stumble over the idea of a sovereign God regretting something
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.120]   as though he would do it differently if he had another chance." What would you say
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:48.240]   to Ryan, Pastor John? This is a huge and important issue. Back in the mid-90s, mid
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:59.440]   1990s, I was embroiled in disputes over what is called open theism, which argues
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:09.160]   that God is open to the future in the sense that he does not have exhaustive
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:17.480]   knowledge of what is coming in the future. So he's open, ended. Now I regard
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.800]   that position as profoundly wrong, unbiblical, dishonoring to the Lord,
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.280]   undermining to the gospel, and to his purposes in the world. So you can see why
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:37.960]   I was embroiled in this controversy. One of the arguments used by open theists is
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.320]   that there are passages in the Bible where God regrets or repents, as the old
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:53.640]   King James says, what he has done and therefore must not have been able to
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.000]   foresee what would come of his decisions, otherwise he would not have done them if
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.880]   he really regrets them. Now Ryan, in asking his question, has mentioned two of
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.520]   these, Genesis 6, 6 and 7, and 1 Samuel 15, 11. So what I'm going to do is
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.080]   take just one of those, 15, 11, because I think if we can show how one is explained
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.600]   and other passages in the Bible fall into place as well. When Saul disobeys
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   Samuel, God says, "I regret," or King James, "I repent that I have made Saul king, for he
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.880]   has turned back from following me and has not carried out my commands." That's
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:51.200]   1 Samuel 15, 11. So some have argued, as I said, that since God repents, regrets,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   making him king, therefore if he had to do over again, he wouldn't because he
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.320]   couldn't see what was coming, else why would he repent or regret if he knew in
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.080]   advance the consequence of his decision and chose to do it anyway? Now I don't
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.000]   think that is a compelling argument against God's foreknowledge, complete
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.800]   exhaustive foreknowledge, of what was going to come of Saul, and for several
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.160]   reasons. I'll just mention a couple. One has to do with the complexity of God's
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.560]   emotional life, and the other has to do with the context in 1 Samuel 15, where I
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.120]   think the writer explicitly does something to keep us from drawing a
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.560]   wrong conclusion about God's foreknowledge. So the first problem
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:54.120]   with that view is that it assumes God could not or would not lament over a
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.880]   state of affairs that he himself chose to bring about, but that assumption I
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.360]   think is not true to experience and not true to the Bible, and more importantly
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:17.240]   God's heart is capable of complex combinations of emotions infinitely more
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:24.920]   remarkable than ours. He may well be capable of lamenting over something he
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:33.360]   chose to bring about, and God may be capable of looking back on the very act
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.160]   of bringing something about and lamenting that act in one regard while
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.840]   affirming it as best in another regard. Here's an example from from my
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:56.080]   experience, see if this helps. If I spank my son for blatant disobedience and he
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:05.600]   runs away from home because I spanked him, I may feel some remorse over the
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:13.400]   spanking, not in the sense that I disapprove of what I did, but in the
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.080]   sense that I feel some sorrow that the spanking was necessary and a part of a
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.840]   wise way of dealing with my son in this situation, and great sorrow that he ran
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   away. If I had to do it over again I would still spank him. It was the right
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.840]   thing to do, even knowing that one consequence would be alienation for a
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.480]   season. I approve the spanking from one angle and at the same time I regret the
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:56.640]   spanking from another angle. If such a combination of emotions is possible for
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:04.400]   me in my finite decisions, it's not hard for me to imagine that God's infinite
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.880]   mind, the infinite complexity of God's emotional life would be capable of
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:17.240]   something similar or even more complex. But most important is the context of
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:24.600]   1st Samuel 15, not just my effort to try to imagine God's emotional life. Verse 11,
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:32.080]   "I repent or I regret that I have made Saul king." Then he says, "As if to clarify
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:39.400]   and protect us from misusing," verse 11, he says in verse 29, so this would be 28
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:46.680]   verses later, I mean 18 verses later, "The glory of Israel will not lie or repent
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:56.360]   or regret, for he is not a man that he should repent." Now the point of that
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:03.520]   verse seems to be that even though there is a sense in which God does repent, it
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.400]   says so in verse 11, he did, there's another sense in which he does not
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:16.120]   repent. Verse 29, same word in Hebrew. He does repent? No, he doesn't repent. And the
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:24.680]   difference would naturally be that God's repentance happens in spite of perfect
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.400]   foreknowledge, and that's what it means to be God, while most human repentance
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.480]   happens because we lack foreknowledge. God's way of repenting is unique to God.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:44.480]   God is not man that he should repent, the writer says, meaning God is not man that
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:51.160]   he should repent as a man repents in his ignorance of the future. For God to say,
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:58.840]   "I feel sorrow that I made Saul king," is not the same thing as saying, "I would not
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:05.480]   make him king if I had to do it over." Oh yes, he would. God is able to feel sorrow
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:13.920]   for an act in view of foreknown evil, foreknown pain and sorrow and misery, and
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:21.800]   yet go ahead and do it for wise reasons. And so later when he looks back on the
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:29.400]   act, he can feel that very sorrow for the act that he knew was leading to the sad
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:36.600]   conditions like Saul's disobedience. One of the great implications of all this is
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:44.800]   that when God makes a promise to us, he does it with complete foreknowledge of
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.480]   all the future circumstances, and is therefore never caught off guard by
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:59.280]   anything. And so his promises will stand according to his infinite wisdom.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.360]   That is a great assurance. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question, Ryan.
