[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.080]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.260]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.960]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.680]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.280]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.740]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.140]   Today, we are going to talk about our sense of self,
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.880]   or what's called interoception.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.140]   Interoception is our sensing of our internal landscape,
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.780]   things like our heartbeat, our breathing,
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.400]   and our gut.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.320]   This discussion about sense of self and interoception
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.780]   has many important actionable items
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.560]   that relate to bodily health and brain health.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.440]   Of all the topics I could cover,
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.640]   this thing that we call sense of self,
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.560]   which is also called interoception,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.460]   has perhaps the most foundational level of importance
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.700]   for all that we feel, all that we do,
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.660]   and all that we are capable of doing.
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.000]   And I promise that if you can learn a little bit
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.320]   about the mechanisms of self-sensing,
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.040]   of understanding what's going on in your internal milieu,
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.820]   as we say, your internal environment,
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.840]   you will position yourself to do some very simple things
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.300]   that can lead to outsized positive effects
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.840]   on everything from sleep,
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.100]   to body composition,
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.620]   to mental focus,
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.320]   to mood,
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.660]   your ability to regulate stress,
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.200]   and indeed, even your ability to heal and recovery
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.620]   from injuries of different kinds,
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.100]   brain injury and bodily injury.
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.320]   We have a system in our body
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.900]   that connects our brain to all of our bodily organs
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.300]   and connects all of those bodily organs to our brain.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.260]   And that communication between brain and body
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.080]   in both directions creates a situation
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.800]   where either we are positioned to do things well,
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.900]   or we are positioned to do things poorly.
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.660]   So I really want to dive in and dissect
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.920]   what is this system of brain-body communication?
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.720]   What does it look like?
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.600]   What are the actual neurons and connections?
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.040]   The system that's most often associated with this
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.340]   is our 10th cranial nerve called the vagus nerve.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.060]   The word vagus relates to the word vagabond,
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.080]   which is to wander.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.360]   And indeed, the vagus nerve is a vast,
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.200]   enormous wandering set of nerves.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.200]   So it's not one nerve.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.760]   It's not like one fiber, one axon, as we say.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.640]   So where do they go?
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.880]   Well, they leave the brain and the brain stem.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.560]   The brain stem is kind of the back of your brain.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.820]   If you touch the back of your neck,
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.220]   it's about three inches deep to where you're touching.
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.440]   The neurons that are there
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.420]   send information into the body
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.180]   to control your bodily organs.
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.400]   How fast your heart is beating,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.640]   how fast you're breathing,
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.740]   how fast your digestion is occurring.
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.760]   Even things like whether or not
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.440]   you are going to secrete so-called killer cells,
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.620]   your immune cells from your spleen
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.360]   to go ward off bacteria.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.500]   Now the neurons there don't know what to do
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.180]   unless they receive information
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.100]   about what's going on within the body.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.680]   So everything from your intestines
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.100]   to your stomach, et cetera,
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.260]   and your spleen are sending information
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.720]   also up to the brain.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.500]   There are two fundamental features
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.320]   of what's going on in your body
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.020]   that need to be communicated to your brain,
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.500]   these neurons in your brain stem,
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   in order for your brain and your body
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.920]   to work together correctly.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.000]   And the two types of information
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.800]   are mechanical information
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.180]   and chemical information.
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.460]   So when you think about your sense of self
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.120]   and your ability to understand
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.280]   what's going on in your body,
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.040]   if you feel good or if you feel bad,
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.980]   your sense of self is dependent
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.100]   on these mechanical phenomenon
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.160]   and these chemical phenomenon.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.140]   If your gut is full or empty,
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.700]   whether or not your heart is beating fast
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.560]   or beating slowly,
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.460]   that's mechanical.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.380]   And chemical information,
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.040]   whether or not your gut feels nice
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.920]   and whether, you know,
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.800]   when I say nice,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.300]   I mean whether or not it has a balance
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.460]   of acidity and alkalinity
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.700]   that feels right to you
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.460]   or whether or not your gut feels off,
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.800]   it doesn't feel quite right.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.640]   That's chemical information.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.560]   So the first principle
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.600]   that everyone should understand
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.980]   about their sense of self
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.360]   is that they are sensing mechanical
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.640]   and chemical information
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.500]   about every organ in their body,
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.280]   except for one
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.700]   and that's the brain.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.920]   Your brain actually
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.740]   doesn't have pain receptors.
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.260]   It doesn't even have touch receptors.
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.120]   The brain is a command center.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.620]   It helps drive
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.580]   and govern changes
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.720]   in the organs of the body.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.860]   So your organs are different.
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.080]   They need to tell your brain
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.920]   what's going on
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.980]   and there are ways
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.220]   that you can control
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.840]   the mechanical
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.380]   and the chemical state
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.520]   of your organs
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.260]   in ways that are very powerful.
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.420]   So let's talk about
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.360]   how you can adjust
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.080]   the mechanical
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.260]   and chemical environment
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.260]   of your organs
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.280]   in order to make
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.980]   your brain better
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.160]   and how your brain
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.540]   can make the mechanical
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.180]   and chemical environment
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.140]   within your organs
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.860]   function better.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.480]   Let's take one example
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.280]   of these
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.800]   and explain how mechanical
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.140]   and chemical information
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.220]   from this particular set
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.780]   of organs
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.800]   communicates to the brain
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.820]   and how that changes
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.860]   how our brain works.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.200]   And the organ
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.380]   I'd like to focus on first
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.760]   are the lungs
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.060]   and the diaphragm.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.100]   So we're all familiar
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.540]   with our lungs.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.940]   these two big bags of air
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.360]   but they're actually
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.280]   not two big bags of air.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.800]   They actually have
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.200]   little tiny sacks
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.680]   within them.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.440]   Actually millions
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.180]   of little sacks
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.160]   called the aveoli
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.880]   of the lungs.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.960]   The aveoli,
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.740]   the lungs are like
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.740]   little tiny balloons
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.700]   throughout our lungs.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.960]   Those little bags of air
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.620]   can fill up
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.800]   or they can deflate,
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.460]   right?
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.400]   Just like your lungs
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.460]   overall can fill up
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.300]   or they can deflate.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.320]   The diaphragm is a muscle
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.820]   and it sits below our lungs
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.820]   and the way the diaphragm
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.740]   and the lungs work together
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.500]   is very interesting.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.660]   The diaphragm is actually
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.620]   skeletal muscle.
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.860]   So it's just like a bicep
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.740]   or a quadricep
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.860]   and the fact that it is
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.100]   skeletal muscle is important
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.880]   because it has a unique property
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.760]   which is that you can
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.320]   control it voluntarily.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.900]   How the diaphragm moves up
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.440]   and down
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.840]   determines how you breathe.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.660]   How you breathe
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.340]   is also dependent
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.200]   on little muscles
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.360]   that are between your ribs,
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.400]   the intercostals
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.320]   and other muscles.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.500]   When we inhale,
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.180]   these little sacks
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.280]   in our lungs fill up
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.100]   and our lungs expand
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.760]   and when we do that,
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.720]   we take up space
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.440]   in our thoracic cavity
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.820]   and our diaphragm moves down.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.540]   Okay?
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.040]   When we exhale,
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.520]   the diaphragm moves up,
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.100]   the lungs get smaller.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.620]   Okay?
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.960]   This actually controls
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.980]   our heart rate
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.480]   and it works
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.480]   in the following way.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.600]   Our heart actually
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.760]   has a little more space
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.320]   because the diaphragms move down
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.620]   so the heart gets
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.440]   a little bit bigger,
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.280]   physically bigger,
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.420]   not in the emotional sense,
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.660]   but physically bigger
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.360]   and as a consequence,
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.140]   whatever blood is in the heart
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.380]   flows at a slower rate
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.460]   because it's a larger volume.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.780]   So bigger volume heart,
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.600]   same amount of blood
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.220]   inside the heart
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.680]   means slower flow.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.440]   The brain registers that
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.180]   because there are a set
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.000]   of neurons on the heart
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.600]   called the sinoatrial node.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.520]   That information
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.040]   is registered by the brain
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.900]   and the brain sends
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.400]   a message back to the heart
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.220]   to speed the heart up.
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.780]   So if you do long inhales
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.780]   or you inhale more vigorously,
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.100]   you actually are speeding
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.980]   your heart up.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.340]   Now, of course,
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.900]   you have to exhale as well.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.900]   But for instance,
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.340]   if I were to inhale very long,
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.020]   like the entire time
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.080]   my heart rate is increasing
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.560]   and then if I did a quick exhale,
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.780]   something else will happen.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.080]   But if I kept doing that,
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.360]   my heart rate would increase.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.260]   It's not going to increase
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.420]   linearly and forever,
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.460]   but it will increase
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.640]   with each inhale.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.340]   or I can simply make
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.540]   my inhales more vigorous
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.200]   and my heart rate
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.880]   will speed up.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.300]   This is an autonomic
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.280]   and automatic relationship
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.000]   between the diaphragm,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.480]   the lungs,
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.900]   the brain and the heart.
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.280]   Now, if inhales speed the heart up,
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.300]   what happens on exhales?
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.300]   When we exhale,
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.900]   the diaphragm moves up.
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.200]   The heart has less space,
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.460]   meaning it gets
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.420]   a little bit smaller,
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.520]   which means that
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.540]   whatever volume of blood
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.360]   is inside the heart
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.520]   moves faster
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.820]   through that smaller volume.
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.520]   That information
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.680]   is sent to the brain
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.100]   via these collection
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.560]   of neurons
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.100]   called the sinoatrial node.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.400]   The brain then sends information
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.820]   via the vagus nerve
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.280]   back to the heart
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.580]   to slow the heart down.
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.360]   So while inhales
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.880]   speed up the heart,
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.220]   exhales slow the heart down.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.360]   And you can leverage this
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.440]   in a very powerful way
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.400]   to set the conditions
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.200]   of your mind.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.500]   If you want to be more calm,
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.180]   emphasize exhales.
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:14.980]   And the simplest way
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:15.400]   to do this
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.640]   is to emphasize exhales
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.040]   through what's called
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.600]   a physiological sigh.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.000]   Two inhales
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.360]   followed by a long exhale.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.880]   Those double inhales
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.700]   are kind of important
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.480]   because what they do
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.540]   is they maximally fill
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.360]   all those little sacs
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:30.880]   in your lungs.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.660]   And then when you breathe out,
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.740]   you're exhaling
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.760]   as much of the carbon dioxide
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.980]   in your system as possible.
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.400]   when you make exhales longer,
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.860]   you're slowing your heart rate.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.860]   You're calming down.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.300]   The opposite is also true.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.400]   If you inhale deeply
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.300]   or vigorously
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.880]   and then exhale less long
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.100]   or less vigorously,
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.380]   you will increase
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.360]   your level of alertness
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.940]   through these purely mechanical
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.660]   aspects of your interoception.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.440]   It only takes two or three of those
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.560]   before you start to feel more alert.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.360]   And that's because
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.660]   your heart rate is increasing.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.100]   And actually,
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.020]   if you keep doing that
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.400]   for 25 or 30 breaths
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.580]   of inhale deep,
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.380]   short exhale,
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.880]   you will start to secrete
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.980]   a lot of adrenaline.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.740]   You will actually feel
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.560]   as if you've had
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.300]   a couple of espresso.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.320]   You will immediately wake up
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.700]   through purely mechanical means.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.000]   Changing the way
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.800]   that you breathe,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.960]   emphasizing inhales
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.480]   or exhales
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.400]   or keeping them the same
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.080]   will change the way
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.920]   that your brain works,
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.260]   how alert you are
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.300]   and how well you function
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:27.820]   in anything.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.560]   And again,
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.800]   this doesn't mean
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.280]   that breath work
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.120]   has no value.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.420]   is just simply to say
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.520]   that long extended protocols
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.060]   of breath work
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:35.820]   are simply,
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.680]   they are truly simply
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.680]   just an exploration
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.360]   of this fundamental relationship
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.400]   between the mechanics
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.960]   of your internal organs
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.200]   and your brain
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.180]   and how your brain
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.560]   controls those internal organs.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.260]   So now I want to shift
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.300]   away from breathing
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.420]   and diaphragm
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:50.880]   and lungs
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.720]   and move toward
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.020]   another organ
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.060]   within our viscera,
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.640]   which is our gut.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.700]   So this includes
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.220]   our stomach
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.000]   and our intestines,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.920]   our esophagus
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.580]   and so forth.
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.340]   It's been said before,
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:01.980]   both by me
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:02.740]   and by others
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:03.580]   that we are
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.980]   but a series of tubes
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.020]   and indeed that's true.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:06.560]   Believe it or not,
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.840]   every system in your body
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.640]   is a tube.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.380]   Your brain
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.500]   is actually a tube
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.140]   that connects
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:12.880]   to your spinal cord,
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.900]   which is also a tube.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.580]   Your digestive system
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.660]   starts with the tube
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.500]   at your mouth
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.740]   and of course
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.160]   goes down
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.860]   through your throat
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.120]   and then you've got
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.660]   all the elements
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.180]   of the stomach
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:23.880]   and the intestines
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.980]   and then it comes out
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:25.560]   the other end.
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.320]   So you are
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:26.860]   but a series
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.680]   of different tubes,
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.700]   your vascular system,
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.680]   a series of other tubes.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.760]   The way your digestive system
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.580]   works
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.680]   is to communicate
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.520]   to your brain
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.820]   about the status
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.660]   of the mechanical pressures
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.900]   along this tube.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.080]   So within your stomach
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.760]   and your intestines,
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.240]   et cetera,
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.040]   and the chemical status
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.460]   of that tube
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.780]   at various portions
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.520]   within that tube
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.120]   to inform your brain
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.700]   about how your brain
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.240]   should control that tube.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.200]   So let's start
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.060]   with the mechanical
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.000]   mechanical sensing
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.040]   of your gut.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.780]   If you drink
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.440]   a lot of fluid
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.280]   or if you eat
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:01.940]   a lot of food,
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.560]   your gut will fill up.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.240]   If there's a lot
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:04.840]   of that food,
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.120]   pressure receptors
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.460]   communicate to the areas
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:07.940]   of your brain
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.480]   that are involved
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.080]   in feeding
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.120]   and will say,
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.200]   don't eat anymore.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.040]   You don't need
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.860]   to consume anymore.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.640]   The converse
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.520]   is also true
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.720]   when these receptors
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.560]   signal to the brain
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.000]   that the gut
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.620]   is empty.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.200]   So when you find
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.300]   yourself at the refrigerator
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.800]   or you find yourself
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.560]   almost manically
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.540]   trying to get food
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.120]   of different kinds,
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:25.900]   you're not even thinking
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:26.620]   about what you're eating
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.620]   because you're so hungry.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.620]   In part,
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.220]   that's because
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.160]   the lack of food
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:30.640]   in your gut
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.720]   has sent
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.840]   that information
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.780]   to your brain
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.740]   and is driving
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.560]   particular fixed action
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.020]   patterns
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:37.660]   that are associated
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.140]   with eating.
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:38.980]   So if you've eaten
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.660]   anything,
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.280]   even if it's
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:40.900]   a small volume
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.260]   of food
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:41.900]   in the last
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.300]   hour to three hours,
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.760]   it's actually
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.800]   a worthwhile practice
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.880]   to take a few moments,
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.500]   maybe 10,
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.280]   20 seconds
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.240]   and actually
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.420]   just try and concentrate
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.500]   on sensing
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.600]   the neurons
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.240]   in your gut
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.120]   and how full you are.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.100]   The consequence of that
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:55.480]   is actually
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.160]   rather interesting.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:56.720]   It's been shown
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.400]   that the consequence
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.140]   of that is actually
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.000]   that you can better
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.780]   override the signals
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.480]   of gut fullness
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.260]   or emptiness.
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.860]   So there are other ways
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:04.540]   that our guts
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.700]   communicate with our brain.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.800]   It's not just our stomach
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.800]   talking to our brain.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.440]   it's also our intestines
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.620]   talk to our brain.
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.480]   The Lieberle's lab,
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.300]   the guy's name
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.280]   is Stephen Lieberle's.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:15.860]   He runs a lab
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.780]   at Harvard Medical School.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.340]   They discovered
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.740]   a category of neurons
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.340]   called the GLP1R neurons
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.060]   and those neurons
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.160]   send little wires
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.340]   down into the intestines
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.860]   and deep into the stomach
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.980]   but mostly into the intestines
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.020]   and they sense stretch
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:33.940]   of your intestines
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.580]   and then those neurons
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.760]   send another branch.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.260]   So they have a branch
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:37.920]   in one direction
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.180]   senses what's going
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:39.820]   on in your intestines
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.040]   and they have another branch
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.480]   that goes up from your neck
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.320]   into your brain
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.060]   to either trigger
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.640]   the desire to eat more
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.740]   or to stop eating.
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:47.840]   So these are really,
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.620]   really cool neurons
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.160]   and they're basically
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.920]   stretch receptors.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.440]   and in addition to that,
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.300]   the Lieberle's lab discovered neurons
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.420]   that detect nutrients themselves.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.920]   These neurons are activated
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.680]   by the presence
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.380]   of fatty acids,
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.640]   amino acids
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.640]   and as a third food item,
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.180]   sugars are coming
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.400]   from the foods
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:06.940]   that we eat.
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:07.740]   These neurons
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.040]   will fire a lot
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.540]   to the brain
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:09.860]   that says,
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.340]   hey,
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.680]   whatever you're doing up there,
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.620]   do more of it.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.100]   Now the sugars
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.300]   are a little bit cryptic
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.780]   because when I say sugars
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.200]   or I say amino acids
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.480]   or I say fatty acids,
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.820]   this has nothing
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.840]   to do with taste.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.720]   In fact,
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.580]   beautiful experiments
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.140]   have been done
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.440]   by the Borges lab
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.240]   and by other labs
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.380]   showing that even
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.800]   if you numb the mouth,
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.960]   even if you gavage,
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.900]   which is a really just,
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.000]   it's a fancy word
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.600]   for basically tube feeding.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.460]   You put a tube
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:36.980]   down in the gut,
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:37.540]   you just deliver
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.180]   the food to the gut
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.200]   so you get no opportunity
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:39.980]   to taste it.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.000]   Sounds pretty awful.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.200]   If you force feed
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.080]   by gavage
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.600]   or you numb the mouth,
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.460]   these neurons
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.180]   don't care about the mouth.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.320]   They only care about
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:48.860]   the nutrients
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.820]   coming from these foods
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.660]   and then they signal
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.180]   to the brain,
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:51.580]   hey,
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.620]   do that thing.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.200]   Do that thing
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.000]   where you lift that object
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.720]   we call a fork
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.200]   or a spoon.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:56.780]   Do that thing
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:57.680]   where you drink
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.260]   the milkshake.
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:58.800]   Do that thing
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.440]   where you move
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.340]   your mouth like this,
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.020]   not talking,
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:01.720]   but do that thing
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.380]   where you swallow.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.740]   So that's how
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.720]   the nutrients
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.880]   in our gut control us
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.540]   and this is why
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.320]   for people that
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.340]   experience
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.680]   extreme sugar cravings
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.360]   or even mild sugar cravings,
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.780]   replacing those foods
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.240]   with foods
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.220]   that have high levels
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.100]   of omega-3
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.640]   or amino acids
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.080]   can reduce sugar cravings
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.900]   and I've talked about this
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.080]   on a previous episode
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.280]   but the point is
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.000]   these neurons
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.360]   don't really know taste.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.660]   They only know nutrients
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.680]   and so you can work
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.320]   with that system
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.680]   if you crave sugar
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.460]   and I do believe
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.420]   that most
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.120]   if not all of us
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.220]   should be trying to limit
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.160]   if not eliminate
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.120]   simple sugars
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.460]   as much as possible
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.440]   most of the time
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.460]   then things like
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.920]   high omega-3 foods
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.660]   etc.
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.500]   Maybe you even want
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:42.900]   to supplement
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.620]   with fish oil
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.780]   or something similar
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.620]   to get omega-3s
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.260]   there are other reasons
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.200]   for wanting to do that too
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.420]   can be very beneficial
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.440]   and here's what
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.360]   we're talking about
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.840]   is interoception.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.340]   It's your ability
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.520]   to sense your inner
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.180]   real estate
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.300]   but in this case
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.840]   by way of chemical signaling
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.700]   not by way of
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.780]   mechanical signaling.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.120]   so now I'd like
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:01.600]   to talk about
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.520]   another aspect
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.900]   of gut chemistry
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.200]   that has
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.260]   profound effects
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.060]   on the brain
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:07.720]   as well as
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   on the immune system.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.960]   Your gut needs
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.600]   to maintain
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.480]   a certain level
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.440]   of acidity
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.580]   or alkalinity.
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.540]   For those of you
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.360]   without any chemistry
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:15.940]   background
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.480]   basically the low numbers
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.880]   on the pH scale
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.880]   that means more acidic.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.300]   The higher the numbers
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.940]   more alkaline.
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:24.980]   So more alkaline
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:25.900]   means more basic
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.060]   and acidic
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.840]   means acidic.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.880]   Your gut needs
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.840]   to be more acidic
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.880]   than essentially
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.780]   all other tissues
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.340]   of your body
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.200]   in order to function
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:33.740]   properly.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.320]   Gastric juices
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.400]   are actually
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.880]   powerful modulators
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.020]   of brain state.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.120]   Put differently
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.020]   one of the best
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:41.920]   things that you can do
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.020]   to have a healthy brain
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.080]   a well-functioning brain
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.620]   and a healthy
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.620]   and well-functioning body
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.560]   is to maintain
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.360]   proper gut chemistry
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.280]   and that's
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.320]   basically accomplished
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.280]   by getting
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.220]   the right level
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.020]   of acidity
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:53.760]   and alkalinity
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.600]   in your gut.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.020]   Now this is not
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.140]   quack pseudoscience
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:57.500]   but we're going
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.340]   to talk about now
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.760]   our peer-reviewed data
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.700]   that point to
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.960]   the gut microbiome
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.820]   and its relationship
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.120]   to acidity of the gut
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.780]   and how the gut microbiome
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.200]   can help enhance
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.000]   autoimmune function
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.720]   and various other aspects
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.780]   of brain and body health.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.900]   So within all
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.200]   the mucosal line
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.260]   tissues of our body
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.120]   we have what are called
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.280]   microbiota
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.860]   little microorganisms
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:21.760]   that we didn't make
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.360]   that actually come
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.260]   from our environment
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.660]   or our food
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.220]   and live inside us
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.700]   and there are good
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.500]   microbiota
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.340]   and there are bad
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.140]   microbiota
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.140]   whether or not
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:33.720]   we have
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.540]   good microbiota
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.880]   or bad microbiota
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.580]   depends on
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.360]   one thing
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.700]   and that one thing
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.880]   is how acid
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.040]   or alkaline
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.080]   the given
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:43.920]   mucosal tissue
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.360]   is.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.560]   What you essentially
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.280]   want to do
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.240]   is create
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:47.940]   an environment
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.520]   where the proper
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.200]   microbiota
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:50.880]   can thrive
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.600]   because when
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.360]   you do that
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.620]   you greatly
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.260]   decrease
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.240]   what are called
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.900]   inflammatory cytokines
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:57.540]   so these are things
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.300]   that are secreted
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.360]   both by cells
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.000]   within the body
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.780]   and cells
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.540]   within the brain
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.520]   to impact
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.320]   brain health
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.140]   and brain function
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.000]   and bodily health.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.220]   the simple way
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.020]   to adjust
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:07.560]   these things
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.420]   in the proper
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.520]   ratios
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.280]   is to adjust
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.280]   your gut microbiome
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:12.760]   the best way
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.080]   to adjust
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:13.840]   your microbiome
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.020]   is to ingest
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:15.880]   certain types
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.300]   of foods.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.520]   There was a study
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.880]   done by my colleague
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.820]   Justin Sonnenberg
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.020]   at Stanford School
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:21.460]   of Medicine
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.360]   they explored
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.660]   how different foods
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.160]   or different diets
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:25.840]   I should say
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.780]   impact the gut microbiome
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.080]   and inflammatory markers
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.060]   and what they did
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.840]   is they explored
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.040]   two types of diets
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.720]   one is a high fiber diet
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.720]   and they compared
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.760]   that to diets
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.780]   that were unchanged
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.760]   except for the inclusion
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.140]   of a few
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.720]   to a few more
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.960]   servings of fermented
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.840]   foods each day
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.000]   and the takeaway
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.020]   message from this study
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.100]   is that the fermented
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.080]   foods far outperformed
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.240]   the high fiber diet
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.000]   the bigger message
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.440]   is that all of us
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.240]   should be ingesting
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.780]   on a regular basis
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.500]   daily basis
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.420]   fermented foods
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.140]   of different kinds
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:58.520]   and why
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.140]   I say that
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:00.620]   is because
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.800]   the inflammatory markers
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.360]   went down
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.900]   the markers
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.840]   of autoimmune
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.700]   disruption
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.520]   went down
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.520]   and the chemistry
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.140]   of the gut
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:10.540]   therefore
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.780]   was adjusted
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.040]   in the appropriate ways
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.080]   and it's been shown
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.120]   in other studies
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.040]   that when
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.700]   the correct gut
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:18.560]   microbiota
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.380]   are present
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.700]   and these inflammatory
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.080]   markers are reduced
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.880]   cognition improves
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.140]   so ability to focus
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.460]   ability to sleep
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.520]   ability to ward off
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:27.980]   infection
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.860]   and wound healing
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.920]   all enhanced
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.920]   so while today
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.140]   is about interoception
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:32.600]   we're talking
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.380]   about sensing
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.160]   we're also talking
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:34.840]   about subconscious
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.340]   sensing
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.120]   we're talking
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:36.820]   about subconscious
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.280]   sensing
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.300]   of the milieu
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.180]   of the body
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:39.780]   when the milieu
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.440]   of the gut
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.040]   in the body
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.100]   is right
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.280]   then the brain
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.120]   and the immune
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.040]   system function
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:45.800]   very well
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.700]   it's very clear
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.760]   that's fermented foods
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.400]   and that's keeping
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.340]   the stomach
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.920]   slightly more acid
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.760]   than one might think
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.640]   you would want to
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.720]   so now I want
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.300]   to talk about
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.620]   two other forms
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.820]   of mechanical
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.540]   and chemical
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.000]   sensing
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.320]   that we
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.440]   very much
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.200]   can detect
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:01.760]   at a conscious
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.100]   level
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.340]   and those are
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:03.920]   fever
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.160]   and barfing
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.200]   so let's talk
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:06.820]   about barfing
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.260]   first
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.620]   barfing
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.820]   aka vomiting
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.960]   is when
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.680]   the contents
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.380]   of your guts
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.440]   run in reverse
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.440]   meaning when they
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.260]   go up from
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:16.840]   your stomach
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.980]   out the esophagus
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:18.460]   and mouth
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.320]   and onto
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.020]   whatever surface
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:21.780]   happens to be
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.440]   in front of you
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.400]   it's a terrible
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:23.920]   thing nobody
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.660]   likes to do it
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.300]   but it's a very
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.340]   interesting aspect
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.060]   to our biology
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.200]   because it reveals
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.760]   a beautiful
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.940]   and absolutely
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:32.560]   fundamental
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.180]   relationship
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.180]   between our
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:34.740]   chemistry
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.820]   and our brain
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.080]   so your brain
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.320]   is actually
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.260]   locked behind
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:41.780]   a gate
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:42.820]   and that gate
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.880]   is not your skull
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.440]   that gate
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.260]   is the so-called
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.440]   blood-brain barrier
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.700]   it's absolutely
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.380]   fundamental
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.800]   that only
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.680]   certain molecules
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.420]   get across
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.280]   the blood-brain barrier
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:53.980]   and that others
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.440]   don't
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.040]   and the reason
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:55.520]   for that
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.400]   is that
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.500]   most all
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.900]   99.9999%
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.980]   of your neurons
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.400]   do not regenerate
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.140]   I don't care
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:03.960]   what you've read
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.780]   especially in the news
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:05.680]   recently about how
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.400]   psychedelics cause
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:06.980]   neurogenesis
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.260]   because they don't
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.040]   it's absolutely
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:09.620]   wrong
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.640]   psychedelics have
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.320]   effects on brain
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:11.760]   plasticity
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.160]   but they have
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:12.820]   nothing to do
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.460]   with neurogenesis
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.160]   at least no data
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:14.640]   support it
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.100]   but because
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.040]   you can't make
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:17.840]   new neurons
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.380]   you also
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.300]   can't damage
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:20.700]   the ones
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.240]   you've got
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.100]   or you shouldn't
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:22.960]   as much as possible
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.460]   and that's why
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.080]   you have a
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.340]   blood-brain barrier
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.560]   or a BBB
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.720]   so the BBB
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.600]   as it's called
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.420]   prevents substances
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.200]   from getting
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.180]   to the brain
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.700]   however
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.900]   like any fence
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.140]   it is not
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.200]   always uniform
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.440]   along its length
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.100]   and there are
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.020]   little spots
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.980]   within that fence
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.600]   where chemicals
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.680]   can sneak
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.440]   across to the
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:47.740]   brain
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.560]   but through a
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.360]   beautiful design
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.320]   of some sort
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.720]   there are little
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.520]   holes in that
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:54.900]   fence
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.940]   and there are
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:56.640]   little neurons
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.920]   that sit right
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.860]   behind those holes
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.280]   and those neurons
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.140]   sense what the
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:02.920]   chemistry of the
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.700]   blood is
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.040]   so I'm guessing
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:05.640]   you probably didn't
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.420]   imagine that today's
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.040]   discussion about
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.740]   sensing the self
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.360]   would be sensing
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.320]   your own blood
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.260]   but you do
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.020]   there is a
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.720]   little area
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.300]   of your brain
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:12.980]   that's little
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:13.920]   indeed but is
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.780]   very very important
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:15.500]   called area
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.320]   postrema
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.420]   p-o-s-t-r-e-m-a
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.160]   an area postrema
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:21.860]   is an area
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.540]   of the brainstem
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.440]   that sits right
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:24.940]   next to another
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.500]   brain area
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.340]   called the
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.080]   chemoreceptor
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.960]   trigger zone
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.460]   and when
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.840]   the contents
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:31.980]   in your bloodstream
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.700]   are of a
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.540]   particular kind
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.260]   meaning when
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:35.860]   there are
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.480]   pathogens
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.880]   or it's
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.580]   too acidic
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.640]   the neurons
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.080]   in area
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.700]   postrema
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.180]   and the neurons
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.440]   in the chemoreceptor
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.480]   trigger zone
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.340]   trigger a bunch
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:46.980]   of motor
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.780]   reflexes
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.920]   in the abdominal
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.900]   wall
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.480]   that make you
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.860]   barf
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.060]   okay
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.500]   the feeling
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.080]   that you need
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.860]   to throw up
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.700]   is triggered
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.320]   by these neurons
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.000]   in the brainstem
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.580]   and those neurons
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.120]   in the brainstem
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:00.720]   are triggered
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.620]   by the presence
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.700]   of certain chemicals
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.840]   and the reason
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.400]   why you don't
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:04.900]   have any blood
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.520]   brain barrier
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.480]   at that location
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.520]   is because postrema
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.360]   has to be there
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.500]   like a crossing
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:09.880]   guard
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.660]   making sure
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.340]   that everything
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:11.880]   that's coming
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.580]   through the blood
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:13.500]   is okay
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.520]   and if it even
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.300]   senses just the
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.100]   tiniest bit
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:16.960]   that things are
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.300]   off
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:17.900]   it's going to
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.440]   trigger that
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.140]   reflex
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.220]   some people
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:21.860]   the memory
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.580]   of or the
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.140]   thought of
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:24.740]   something like
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.520]   blood or
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.260]   vomit or
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:26.780]   use your
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.320]   imagination
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.100]   can actually
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:28.840]   trigger the
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.820]   vomit reflex
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.880]   and that's
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.440]   because these
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:31.940]   neurons in
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:32.640]   area postrema
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.240]   are very
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:34.960]   sensitive to
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.040]   prior experience
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.220]   of interactions
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.380]   with negative
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:38.880]   things
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.880]   the neurons
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.340]   of area
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.000]   postrema
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.460]   are there
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.360]   basically to
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:43.880]   keep your
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.560]   whole system
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.060]   safe
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:45.720]   so let's
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.160]   talk for a
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:46.660]   second about
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.280]   how to
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.640]   reduce nausea
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.720]   because nausea
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.800]   that salivation
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.220]   that feeling
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:51.480]   that you're
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:51.640]   going to
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:51.880]   vomit
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.320]   can be very
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:53.760]   beneficial
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.320]   and in an
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.300]   adaptive
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:55.920]   circumstance
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.820]   like you've
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.120]   ingested
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.700]   something bad
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.040]   but some
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:58.660]   people experience
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.200]   nausea
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.020]   for other
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:00.400]   reasons
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.660]   there are
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.700]   good ways
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.340]   to regulate
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:03.880]   nausea
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.580]   and the
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:05.040]   ways they
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:05.760]   regulate
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.080]   nausea
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.340]   are very
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:06.660]   interesting
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.180]   they actually
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:07.760]   adjust the
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.240]   activity
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.720]   of these
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.200]   neurons in
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:10.960]   area postrema
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.840]   or they
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.420]   change the
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:12.940]   chemistry of
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.300]   the blood
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:13.920]   directly
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.540]   and many
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:15.940]   of you have
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:16.260]   heard this
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.120]   before perhaps
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:17.560]   but it
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.020]   turns out
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:18.400]   that there
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:18.860]   are good
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.380]   data
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.480]   11 research
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.000]   studies were
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.280]   the ones
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:21.540]   that I
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:21.920]   could find
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.480]   peer-reviewed
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.100]   research studies
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:23.660]   with no
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.180]   bias
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:24.660]   so independent
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.020]   studies
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:25.760]   showing that
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.160]   ginger
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.260]   can cause
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.940]   a notable
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:29.940]   reduction
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:30.900]   in nausea
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.520]   how much
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:31.860]   ginger
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.420]   one to
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.040]   three grams
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.980]   and some
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:34.340]   of you
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:34.940]   will not
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:35.500]   be surprised
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:35.900]   to learn
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:36.700]   that cannabis
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.900]   can reduce
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:38.440]   nausea
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.240]   but cannabis
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:39.980]   THC
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.560]   and or
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:41.960]   it turns
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.680]   out CBD
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.280]   can reduce
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:44.860]   nausea
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:45.280]   and it
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:45.940]   probably
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:46.660]   does that
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.660]   by changing
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.320]   the threshold
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.060]   for firing
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:50.520]   of these
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:50.860]   neurons
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:51.280]   in area
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:51.800]   postrema
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.600]   now let's
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.060]   talk about
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:53.480]   fever
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.000]   a fever
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.640]   is simply
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.120]   an increase
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:56.500]   in body
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:56.960]   temperature
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.440]   that increase
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:58.800]   in body
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.080]   temperature
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:23:59.640]   is triggered
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.240]   by neurons
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:00.680]   in the
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.080]   brain
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.340]   and those
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:02.660]   neurons
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:02.920]   in the
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.160]   brain
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:03.820]   are triggered
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:04.220]   by the
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:04.680]   presence
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.420]   of particular
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:05.840]   things
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.140]   in the
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:06.600]   bloodstream
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.860]   what sorts
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:09.320]   of things
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.000]   well
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.060]   toxins
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.360]   bacteria
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.460]   viruses
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.380]   when something
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.120]   bad gets
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:15.400]   in our
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:15.780]   system
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.760]   the body
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.480]   doesn't know
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.420]   it's bad
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.280]   it just
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:19.820]   knows it's
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:20.220]   foreign
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.020]   your body
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:21.480]   has this
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.100]   intelligence
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:22.520]   and that
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:22.920]   intelligence
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.320]   is to
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:23.580]   know
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.180]   hmm
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.020]   these proteins
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:25.480]   are normally
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.000]   not seen
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.300]   in this
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:26.640]   region
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.580]   and then
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.440]   your body
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:28.740]   or the
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:29.000]   cells
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.180]   there
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:29.460]   i should
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:29.640]   say
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:29.840]   will
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.300]   release
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:30.780]   something
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:31.540]   that
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:31.700]   then
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:31.880]   will
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.260]   travel
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:32.580]   to the
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:32.900]   brain
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.800]   and will
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.240]   trigger
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.020]   an increase
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:35.440]   in body
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:35.880]   temperature
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.340]   so that
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:36.720]   your body
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.180]   cooks
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:37.800]   the bad
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.120]   thing
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:38.740]   or the
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.060]   cause
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:39.300]   of the
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:39.500]   bad
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:39.700]   thing
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:39.880]   it's
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.180]   really
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:40.400]   a
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:40.720]   beautiful
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.160]   adaptive
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:41.660]   mechanism
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.000]   so
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.360]   what's
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:43.760]   beautiful
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.120]   about
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:44.340]   the
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:44.580]   fever
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.080]   mechanism
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:45.540]   is
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:45.700]   that
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:45.820]   it
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:46.000]   looks
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:46.300]   a lot
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:46.440]   like
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:46.580]   the
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:46.920]   barfing
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.400]   mechanism
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.400]   basically
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:48.720]   you
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:48.920]   have
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.300]   a set
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:49.440]   of
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:49.880]   neurons
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.460]   that
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:50.700]   sit
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:50.880]   near
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.060]   the

[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:52.180]   you
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:52.340]   are
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:52.480]   a
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:52.740]   tube
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.040]   a
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.260]   series
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:53.440]   of
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:53.660]   tubes
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.180]   and
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:54.360]   your
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:54.780]   brain
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.220]   has
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:55.340]   a

[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:55.680]   down
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:55.820]   the
