[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:12.980]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.520]   People seem to like the new name, Duncan.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.880]   We made the switch from Portfolio Rescue
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.080]   to Ask the Compound, I don't know, a month ago, maybe?
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.740]   - Yeah, we definitely saw an uptick.
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.580]   - It makes sense.
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.760]   Plus it matched the email, so that was easy.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.120]   Ask the Compound show at gmail.com.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.120]   We're still inundated with questions.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.960]   Got a lot going on here.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.400]   Today's show is sponsored by Bird Dogs.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.840]   I used to think the Bird Dog shorts
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.520]   were my favorite, most comfortable piece of clothing.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.880]   See, a little style tip for you guys out there.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.560]   If you wear a bright shirt like me,
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.960]   then you wanna offset that with darker.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.200]   So I got the dark gray Bird Dogs on today.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.720]   And if you wear the really bright Bird Dogs,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.760]   then you wanna go a little, you know,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.240]   white on the top, maybe.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.760]   - That's called contrast.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.440]   - I thought that the shorts were my most favorite.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.800]   I think I'm starting to come around to the idea
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.980]   that the pants and the joggers and the sweatpants,
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.280]   they are so comfortable.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.080]   I just started wearing them this year.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.920]   They're great.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.040]   And because we've been going from 90 degree weather here
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.880]   to 50 degree weather,
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.800]   so I still have the warmup pants
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.000]   as part of my options here.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.840]   It's great.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.080]   I also have with me one of the Bird Dog tumblers, right?
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.920]   I'm not a coffee drinker,
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.080]   but I could use this for Coke Zero, I guess.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.280]   Maybe Diet Pepsi if the Coke Zero's not available.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.920]   - I use mine for coffee, don't worry.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.900]   - Okay, you go to birddogs.com/atc.
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.640]   Put in the code ATC.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.300]   - Oh, news alert, news alert.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.700]   I actually forgot to tell you getting ready today.
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.880]   We don't need the code anymore.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.340]   They automatically are adding the Yeti style tumblers
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.620]   without the code.
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.060]   - All right, great.
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.900]   Get it on your own.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.140]   So, yeah, birddogs.com.
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.580]   They're the most comfortable shorts I wear all summer.
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.680]   I love the pants too.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.420]   All right, we've got some great questions this week.
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.860]   We've got a great guest host, so let's get to it.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.380]   - Okay, up first today, we have a question from John.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.120]   My wife and I are 42 with a 13-year-old son.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.800]   We moved to Phoenix, Arizona as immigrants seven years ago
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.080]   with just a couple thousand dollars to our name.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.680]   Since then, we have slowly progressed in our careers,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.160]   and at this point, we have $350,000 of combined income,
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   $230,000 cash, a $530,000 mortgage with 28 years left,
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.760]   $100,000 in retirement accounts,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.280]   and $75,000 in a brokerage account.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.680]   We are currently saving $8,000 a month.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.300]   We both plan to work for the next 13 years
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.420]   and then think about retirement.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.180]   I need your suggestion on how I can better utilize our cash.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.620]   Should I move this into ETFs or blue chips in a lump sum,
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.660]   or should I plan to invest it in real estate
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.460]   for some passive income?
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.020]   - Okay, this is one of my most favorite questions
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.860]   we've got on this show.
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.980]   I love the story.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.780]   This is honestly what makes this country great,
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.700]   the land of opportunity.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.700]   This is an awesome, awesome story.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.100]   Kudos to you for saving this amount
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.240]   in such a short period of time,
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.780]   starting with $1,000, your name or whatever, coming here.
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.180]   So back of the envelope,
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.180]   it looks like they're saving almost 100 grand a year,
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.940]   which is almost a 30% savings rate based on the income.
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.020]   I'd love to see that.
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.260]   That's very nicely done.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.700]   That's the hardest thing for most people.
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.700]   How do you get a six-figure income
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.180]   and 20 to 30% savings rate?
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.540]   That's how you earn financial freedom, right?
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.180]   But obviously, they know they have
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.240]   way too much cash on hand.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.080]   And before we get into that,
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.780]   I see in the comments here, people watching live,
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.300]   they're wondering how they can get fashion advice
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.540]   from someone who lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.360]   I will have you know, people in the comments,
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.560]   I was voted Mr. GQ in high school yearbook, all right?
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.700]   - Oh, wow. - Just remember that.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.300]   - That was your superlative?
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.780]   - I was, yes, I was Mr. GQ.
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.520]   Most likely to play a college sport,
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.360]   maybe something like that.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.240]   - You know what mine was?
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.880]   Most likely to co-host a podcast with Mr. GQ.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.060]   - All right, see?
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.880]   We had a nice yin-yang here.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.720]   So obviously, there's way too much cash in this portfolio.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.080]   Here's the rough asset allocation by my calculations.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.840]   19% in stocks, which I assume is a brokerage account,
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.280]   25% in retirement accounts,
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.800]   and then 56, 57% or something in cash.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.160]   That's an ungodly amount of cash to have on hand,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.360]   especially if it's not earmarked
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.560]   for a future purchase like a house.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.040]   And it sounds like that's not the case here.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.160]   I would love to be able to tell you
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.560]   how to invest this money, you know,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.520]   be it index funds or ETFs or blue chip stocks or real estate,
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.900]   but I can't really.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.800]   You have the savings part down, but here's what you need.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.040]   You need an investment philosophy.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.680]   You can't just wing it and throw your money into something
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.360]   without having some sort of overarching plan,
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.380]   and it sounds like you don't really have that.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.320]   So there was a story a few years ago.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.840]   Remember when the Seattle Seahawks
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.520]   played New England Patriots in the Super Bowl?
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.080]   There was a story about Seahawks coach Pete Carroll
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.640]   and how in the off season, he does speaking gigs, right?
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.040]   Me and Pete Carroll are very much alike.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.400]   Remember, I was doing a speaking gig last week.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.840]   Pete Carroll also does speaking gigs, so we're just alike.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.120]   In his talks, he begins with a simple question.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.720]   He says, "Raise your hand if you have a philosophy
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.840]   "for your team or organization,"
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.600]   'cause he talks to a lot of business leaders too.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.640]   Of course, everyone raises their hand.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.480]   "How could you be a leader
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.360]   "without having some sort of overarching philosophy?"
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.400]   Then he says, "Can you describe that philosophy
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.580]   "in 25 words or less?"
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.820]   And then basically, everyone's hand goes down, right?
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.160]   He's also, I guess, been known to use this
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.840]   as an interview question for assistants,
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.760]   and he's not really looking for like,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.520]   "Here's the perfect philosophy."
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.120]   It's like, "Do you have one?"
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.960]   That's the whole point.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.080]   So maybe we can try this with my philosophy,
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.920]   and I don't think you have to keep it 25 words or less.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.800]   That's probably a little too much,
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.920]   but let's try it with mine.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.320]   So I believe less is more, costs and taxes matter,
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.880]   predictions are very unreliable,
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.520]   performance is mean reverting.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.800]   I believe risk and reward are attached to the hip,
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.560]   time horizon is your friend,
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.280]   investing must be tied to goals to work effectively,
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.400]   and I really believe that behavior
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.560]   will determine your success or failure as an investor.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.000]   That's kind of my overarching philosophy.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.840]   Might have missed a few things there,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.660]   but that's pretty close.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.760]   So I just view investing philosophy
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.720]   as like the simple set of principles
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.560]   that guide your actions
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.120]   to get you to a yes or a no quicker.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.960]   The whole idea is like,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.000]   you make a few big decisions up front,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.840]   so you don't have to make a bunch
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.040]   of minor decisions along the way.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.240]   So I think without, the whole idea is,
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.760]   philosophy is required before you get to strategy.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.660]   Like, what should I invest in?
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.500]   Well, I don't know,
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.320]   what's your philosophy in the first place?
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.880]   So the way I see it,
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.880]   there are really like four kinds of investors in the world.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.520]   So there's people who have no strategy at all,
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.240]   and they're probably either going to give up
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.120]   or lose most of their money in the markets, unfortunately.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.400]   For every winner, there has to be a loser.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.980]   The second kind of investor is people
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.120]   who just chase fat investments
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.800]   and no coherent plan beyond the short term.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.560]   Third type of investor, I have a plan,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.620]   I have an asset allocation, I have a strategy,
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.840]   but you pretty much fail to follow it
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.960]   when markets go haywire.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.240]   You get really greedy at the top
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.960]   or really fearful at the bottom and you give up,
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.400]   and a plan that you give up on
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.800]   is no different than no plan at all, I think.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.760]   And finally, there's those
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.520]   who have a comprehensive investment plan
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.240]   and the ability to stick with it
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.500]   in manias, panics, and everything in between, right?
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.400]   So this isn't really the answer you want to hear,
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.080]   but to put that cash to work,
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.080]   you have to have that overarching philosophy.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.720]   So here's where I would start with this person,
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.840]   if you're sitting on a huge pile of cash
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.840]   and you don't really know what to do,
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.060]   don't have a philosophy, don't have a strategy.
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.140]   First of all, make sure those future savings,
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.440]   you're doing almost 8,000 a month
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.440]   or whatever it sounds like,
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.700]   automate into your 401ks, IRAs, brokerage accounts, 529s,
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.760]   whatever it is, automate them, right?
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.800]   Get them automated so you don't have to have this problem
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.720]   again in the future with future cash piling up.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.040]   Number two, just start with a target date fund.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.720]   Match it to your retirement date,
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.640]   either at the date, plus or minus five years,
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.120]   whatever it is in terms of your risk profile.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   Target date funds are not perfect by any means,
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.440]   but I think it's one of the simplest ways
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.880]   to just access a broadly diversified exposure to the market.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.240]   It rebalances professionally,
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.600]   it glide paths you closer to a more conservative portfolio
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.080]   as you reach retirement age.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.920]   And then in the future--
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.880]   - How do you not have a branded target date fund
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.900]   by this point?
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.960]   I just don't understand how there's not a Bing Carlson
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.520]   target date fund out there now.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.320]   - That's a good question.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.920]   Yeah, I'm gonna get it tattooed on my back
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.680]   like Bill with the Roth stuff.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.900]   So I think perfect is the enemy of good here.
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.920]   And then with the rest of that cash,
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.060]   I would, most people think probability-wise,
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.520]   investing it in a lump sum is your best bet.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.640]   And we're gonna have someone on the show later
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.160]   who has done a lot of work on that.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.840]   But I think, especially when you're sitting
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.200]   in a huge pile of cash like this,
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.680]   for most people, I think,
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.040]   to go with the regret minimization framework
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.600]   that you dollar cost average it in over some period,
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.900]   weekly, bimonthly, monthly, quarterly, whatever it is,
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.080]   pick a strategy and stick with it
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.520]   and just get that cash invested.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.160]   And again, stick to something simple
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.540]   like a target date fund right away.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.600]   And if you want to branch out from there eventually,
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.480]   that's just a good way to get started.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.480]   Cliff in the chat says the Bend Forever Fund.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.080]   That's not bad.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.160]   - I like that.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.640]   It would be a target date funds of target date funds.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.000]   - Yeah, a fund of funds.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.800]   - A fund of funds, that's it, yeah.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.680]   - Right, next clip.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.320]   But also, just awesome story
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.360]   that these people came to this country,
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.560]   what, seven years ago, they said,
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.840]   with not much to their name.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.000]   They built up this huge saving.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.840]   That's awesome.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.920]   Love to hear it. - Yeah, good job, John.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.480]   Oh, one follow-up I have there that I just noted
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.960]   is they mention blue chips.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.680]   That's just a concept that I hear a lot of,
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.080]   especially people new to investing talk about.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.640]   And they seem to think that,
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.060]   oh, if you invest in blue chips,
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.600]   yeah, your returns might not be as good,
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.180]   but they're super safe.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.280]   And I was just gonna ask you your take on that.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.920]   Today's blue chips versus a decade or two decades ago.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.760]   - That's funny, yeah.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.040]   - They change, right?
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.720]   - A lot of people would think that Dow stocks
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.560]   are blue chip stocks,
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.240]   maybe dividend stocks are blue chip stocks.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.700]   It could change where companies like Apple and Microsoft
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.080]   and maybe Google are now considered blue chips eventually,
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.880]   or they will once they mature.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.960]   But yeah, just because you invest in a stock
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.840]   that pays a dividend
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.420]   doesn't mean there's no risk there at all.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.800]   But it does sound very comforting.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   We say, ah, just invest in blue chips.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.840]   It's easy. - Right.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.200]   Like GE would have been a blue chip at one point, right?
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.040]   - Yes.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.680]   GE was definitely a blue chip.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.360]   And it got crushed.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.200]   - Okay. - All right.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.020]   Next question. - Up next,
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.320]   we have a question from Mark.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.900]   I'm 28 years old and self-employed living in South Carolina.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.560]   I have saved around $11,000 across all accounts.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.320]   Roth IRA, my wife's as well.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.720]   SEP IRA, self-directed 401k, HSA, physical gold,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.340]   silver, and other regular brokerage accounts.
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.000]   Sadly, I spent a month in the hospital earlier this year
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.880]   and have been dealing with the bills.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.200]   I used to put aside at least $400 a month
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.840]   for savings or investing,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.400]   but now I'm saving no less than 10% of my income
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.460]   for savings.
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.360]   My question is how I should tackle
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.160]   the interest-free hospital bills.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.240]   Should I just ride them out and pay in time
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.240]   or try to zero it out sooner than later?
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.520]   - He might want to try to see
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.160]   if they'll take physical gold or silver.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.560]   I've never heard physical silver before.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.040]   That's an interesting one.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.340]   First of all, sorry to hear this.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.920]   This is kind of a crappy situation.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.640]   Here's a depressing stat for you.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.960]   According to one study,
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.040]   medical bills reported to be the number one cause
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.320]   of bankruptcies in this country,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.960]   causing more than 60% of all bankruptcies.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.800]   - Crazy.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.760]   - I had a friend from college who did this
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.400]   who didn't get a job right out of school.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.620]   She got very sick and racked up
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:36.840]   these enormous medical bills
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.300]   and had to declare bankruptcy at like 22,
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.200]   which is like on your credit report forever, right?
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.280]   It's crazy.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.200]   Some other stats to consider here.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.960]   Per capita healthcare spending has quadrupled
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.720]   since 1980 in this country.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.860]   Spending on healthcare now makes up 20% of GDP.
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.360]   John, do a chart on here.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.040]   This is employer and worker contributions
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.360]   to healthcare plans.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.720]   Employer contributions are up 43% since 2012.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.560]   Employee contributions are up 41%, which is a lot.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.420]   It's crazy that you have to pay this much more.
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.720]   And it's not just you are paying more,
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.720]   your employer's paying way more too,
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.440]   which is kind of crazy to think about.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.560]   Healthcare is part of your compensation
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.080]   if we're including benefits here.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.220]   So I like to think that people's wages
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.440]   would be a lot higher if we didn't have to pay
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.800]   so much for healthcare.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.640]   I mean, I think the number is like 50 to 60% of workers
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.380]   are covered by a plan from their employer.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.960]   - It is a little wild, but it's tied to your employer, yeah.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.800]   - It is, yeah.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.440]   There's a weird backstory there
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.200]   where this happened in World War II
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.640]   where they put some price controls on
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.400]   and people couldn't pay higher wages.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.600]   So companies actually had to start offering healthcare
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.400]   as a benefit to give people more money.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.880]   And then it kind of stuck from there.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.720]   I don't know what Marco's insurance situation is,
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.800]   but obviously he's feeling some pain
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.440]   if it's eating into his monthly savings.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.080]   My advice here, if you said it's an interest-free loan
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.900]   they're basically giving you,
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.160]   I would be in no hurry to pay it off
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.040]   because why would you when it costs nothing?
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.840]   It costs so much to borrow on other stuff these days
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.600]   and inflation is so high, right off the bat,
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.040]   you're doing way better if they'll let you borrow at 0%
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.600]   and just pay it off slowly.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.440]   I'd pay minimum payments for as long as I could
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.520]   unless this debt's just hanging over you.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.440]   I'd make those minimum payments
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.800]   if they're gonna give it to you at 0%.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.520]   That's an amazing deal these days.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.480]   Alternatively, you could try to negotiate with them, right?
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.380]   Tell them your situation.
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.820]   Here's what I have, here's what I can afford.
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.660]   Can you work with me?
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.440]   What if I made smaller payments
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.520]   or maybe you cut some of it off because I can't.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.200]   It's worth a shot.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.400]   The other thing is what if I just paid it off now?
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.680]   I paid it in a lump sum, could I get some sort of discount?
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.320]   Most people just hate negotiating
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.600]   and I was one of those people too until I tried it.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.120]   And so I do the same thing with banks
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.880]   and credit card companies and cable TV providers, of course.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.640]   - Now you enjoy it, it's like a hobby, right?
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.840]   - It's kind of fun because what's the worst
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.680]   that can happen?
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.840]   They can say no, right?
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.500]   You try to negotiate with them and they say no.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.880]   So I would at least try that,
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.200]   talk to the hospital administrators or whoever's,
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.360]   or insurance company, whoever is dealing with these bills.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.760]   They would rather get something from you than nothing
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.800]   if you tell them you're in a hard spot.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.240]   So I would at least try to negotiate.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.720]   Otherwise, keep paying the minimum payments for 0%
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.080]   and hopefully once it's all gone,
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.080]   then you can start saving that money again.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.480]   - Yeah, and having you even said before
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   that you can even think of as inflation eating away
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.760]   that interest-free balance.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.120]   - Exactly, that's one of the great parts about,
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.320]   holding a bunch of debt is not a great situation,
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.080]   but if inflation is much higher than those future payments,
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.760]   you're paying back on a real basis lower and lower amounts.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.560]   That's why owning a home and having a fixed rate mortgage
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.680]   is such a great inflation edge
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.040]   'cause the one you're paying back
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.040]   is less and less especially.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.560]   I mean, the Fed this week held rates at what,
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.000]   5% or whatever, 5.25% which is still two percentage points
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.680]   higher than my mortgage rate.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.000]   Why would I pay it off in that instance, right?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.200]   When the prevailing rates are so much higher.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.440]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.920]   - All right, next question.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.040]   - Okay, up next we have a question from David.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.920]   Ben, you've mentioned-- - Speaking of housing.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.080]   - Yeah, exactly, nice segue.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.520]   Ben, you've mentioned that you tapped
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.980]   your home equity in the past.
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.000]   This is something I've never considered doing.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Despite being fortunate, not to brag,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.440]   to be sitting on a lot of it,
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.560]   it's 19% of my net worth,
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.000]   which I track on Excel file stay true, Ben.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.360]   So, you have a-- - I track my finances
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.320]   in Excel as well.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.200]   - Yeah, even when rates were low, I didn't see the point.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.640]   If I can't pay cash for something, we don't buy it.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.280]   Cars, cash, landscaping, cash, you get the point.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.960]   I want to redo our laundry room,
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.560]   what Michael would call a mud room,
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.480]   but I don't want to do it until we have the cash.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.120]   Am I missing something?
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.980]   When would you advise tapping your home equity and why?
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.560]   Yes, I'm sitting on a lot of home equity, so what?
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.240]   I'll realize that gain if and when I sell the house
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.280]   and it'll be deployed about time.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.080]   - So, the way we get growth as an economy,
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.960]   I know a lot of people don't like to think this way,
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.880]   but the way the pie gets bigger
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.480]   is people borrow money now and invest for the future.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.760]   They build houses, they build buildings,
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.160]   they start businesses.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.840]   That's how things grow and expand.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.980]   If we didn't have the ability to borrow, we never would.
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.760]   Obviously, paying for big ticket items in cash
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.760]   is a pretty good strategy if you can do it
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.960]   because it's kind of balancing saving now
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.120]   versus saving in the future.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.080]   The one thing is that it requires more patience, obviously.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.480]   You could potentially divert money away
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.320]   from making investments now
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.320]   because you're building those cash piles.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.960]   So, why would you do this?
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.880]   Because you're impatient and you don't want to wait around
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.880]   and you have the ability to maybe pay it back
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.720]   in two or three years
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.680]   as opposed to paying it off in 30 like a mortgage.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.400]   So, the only borrowing my parents ever really did
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.920]   was their mortgage and a HELOC.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.040]   And their home was built in the '70s.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.000]   We moved in in the early 1990s.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.800]   They still live in the same house, 30 plus years later.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.160]   So, over the years, it's a 50 plus year old home.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.720]   They've had to do some big renovations.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.200]   New windows, new roof, new deck.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.920]   They probably could have built a whole new house
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.160]   for the money they spent on this stuff.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.720]   Don't tell them that.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.360]   But every time my dad said the way that he did it
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.480]   is he took a little money out of his HELOC
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.600]   because he had the mortgage paid off
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.840]   and used it as collateral.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.880]   And then he'd pay it off over the course of
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.200]   one, two, three years.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.280]   Like slowly pay it off in monthly increments.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.060]   And in that case, the interest rate
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.960]   doesn't matter as much, right?
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.400]   'Cause you're not holding the debt for very long.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.680]   So, I think you're borrowing against a financial asset
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.600]   to make that financial asset more attractive.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.680]   Plus, HELOC interest, as long as you use it
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.360]   to fix up your house for renovations,
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.960]   that interest is tax deductible.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.760]   And Bill Sweet notes that there's a cap on that.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.640]   So, you're limited to $750,000 of borrowing total,
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.700]   including your primary mortgage.
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.740]   That's like the cap.
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.800]   So, Bill did tell me that.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.240]   So, I like the flexibility HELOC offers
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.480]   in that you can pay it back in your own terms.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.800]   And the bank allows me to borrow for 10 years.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.320]   I can write checks on that, pay it back,
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.080]   write more checks, and then after 10 years,
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.440]   you have to pay the principal and interest back
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.360]   over the course of 15 years, kind of like a mortgage.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.480]   Now, this was a much sweeter deal
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.320]   when my HELOC was 3%.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.280]   I checked the rate today, and it's effectively eight.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.120]   It was actually 7.99% on my website.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.520]   So, I wonder if it was really 8%,
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.000]   and then some manager said,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.080]   "Hey, can you just knock that down a basis point?"
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.560]   7.99 looks way, way better than eight.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:12.080]   So, I like to use my home echo line of credit in a pinch
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.960]   if I'm ever writing a large check for something,
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.220]   because then I don't have to shift money around
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.080]   from other savings accounts or brokerage accounts
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.000]   or whatever and interrupt those accounts.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.440]   And I can always pay off the balance
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.000]   if I want to move things around from other sources,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.160]   but listen, if your strategy is to pay
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.640]   for everything in cash, that's fine.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.280]   I just think HELOCs offer some financial flexibility,
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.840]   and especially for a financial asset
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.600]   that's illiquid like a house.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.040]   Like, it's more flexibility
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.520]   where you can provide yourself some liquidity,
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.000]   even if you're having to borrow money
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.200]   and pay little interest.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.400]   - See, I'm literally the opposite.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.080]   I'm like, how can I pay for everything with a credit card,
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.280]   get those points?
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.480]   You know, I'm like, that coffee, that $2 coffee,
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.040]   no, it's gotta be on a credit card, I need those points.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.400]   - Yeah, I wish I could get some points
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.280]   for borrowing from a HELOC.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.360]   Again, the rates today make it not quite as good of a deal
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.000]   as it was a few years ago,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.960]   but I still think if you're gonna pay it off
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.440]   in a relatively short amount of time,
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.080]   the interest that you're gonna pay on it is not that much,
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.820]   and it gives you some more flexibility,
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.200]   especially if you want that mudroom or laundry room now,
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.840]   and you're not gonna wait three years to save up for it,
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.360]   you can borrow now, build it, right off the interest,
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.780]   it's gonna help a little bit,
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.080]   and then you have that and you can pay it off
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.500]   slowly over time for that savings
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.620]   you were gonna make anyway.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.080]   That's the whole point of borrowing.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.480]   - Yeah, you make a compelling argument,
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.240]   and you get to be using that laundry/mudroom in the meantime.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.000]   - Exactly, you just, it's, yeah.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.800]   We don't like to delay gratification in this country,
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.640]   so that's what a HELOC line of credit is for.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.480]   - Yeah.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.920]   Okay, up next we have a question from John,
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.400]   another John, two Johns,
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.960]   and we have John in the background here
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.160]   working on the show, a lot of Johns today.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.120]   Okay, has there ever been a study of the optimal time
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.940]   to take a distribution in retirement?
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.360]   For instance, does it make sense to withdraw the cash
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.440]   you need monthly, or take a full year
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.760]   and park the excess cash in laddered bills
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.080]   for monthly income?
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.760]   I might need a refresher on what laddered bills means.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.520]   - Okay, well, so we, I think that the laddered bills
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.520]   they're talking about is like paying off their bills.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.840]   This isn't like a strategy, they're saying.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.840]   So we get a lot of questions on dollar cost averaging.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.760]   I think this is kind of the reverse of that situation.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.680]   So let's bring in our DCA expert, Nick Maggiuli.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.440]   Nick even wrote a whole book about this subject.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.480]   Just keep buying.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.120]   Nick, a lot of people email us about the tough transition
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.760]   from going from accumulating assets,
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.380]   which is pretty straightforward, right?
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.520]   Because most people just invest out of their paycheck, right?
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.640]   So they dollar cost average, not 'cause they want to,
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.800]   because that's just the strategy they have to take.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.320]   So this is kind of the opposite of it.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.600]   You're sitting on a big pile of money,
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.960]   now how do you take that money out?
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.120]   And we have so many boomers that are retiring
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.720]   on a daily basis now.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.820]   A lot of people are coming to this.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.040]   So is it just dollar cost averaging in reverse?
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.660]   Is that the idea?
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.680]   - I mean, yeah, statistically, that's gonna be the thing
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.560]   that's gonna generate the most money for you, right?
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.680]   Like if you imagine something
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.000]   that just keeps going up over time,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.020]   like over a very long period of time,
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.120]   you'd want to buy that thing as soon as possible
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.120]   and you want to sell it as late as possible, right?
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.920]   So in this particular instance,
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.120]   you'd have to be selling monthly.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.720]   The problem with this though is there is more risk, right?
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.680]   'Cause if the market goes down, something like that,
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.600]   when you go to sell, you're now selling a larger percentage
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.920]   of your portfolio, right?
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.240]   So, and it also depends on rate.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:26.180]   So that's why someone brought up the ladder T-bill option
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.200]   where you're like, okay, I'm gonna take,
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.640]   I'm just gonna, let's say I need $10,000 a month.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.200]   So you take 120K out, you sell that at the beginning,
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.640]   you invest 10,000 to a one month T-bill,
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.380]   10,000 to a two month, right, et cetera,
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.220]   throughout the rest of the year.
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.400]   - Yeah, it's like liability, asset liability matching.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.320]   - Yeah, yeah, and you could definitely do that.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.380]   And so I could see how that would make income.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.560]   And so that might make more sense and it's also less risky.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.760]   So I, it technically, you know,
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.920]   it's better to wait as long as possible to sell,
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.980]   especially assuming this is equity risk you're taking.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.480]   But, you know, at the end of the day,
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.920]   a lot of people are worried about risk
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.320]   and they don't know what's gonna happen with markets.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.880]   I know we're in a new bull market now,
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.280]   but I don't think we're out of the woods yet.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.400]   So, you know, there's, I think, you know,
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.920]   selling early and just, and doing a ladder T-bill
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.000]   given where rates are is not a bad idea right now,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.640]   actually, when rates were at zero,
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.020]   I could have seen someone waiting,
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.400]   but because rates are higher now,
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.000]   I think it could make sense to just--
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.800]   - Okay, so maybe this person was talking about a strategy.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.160]   Duncan, maybe you're right and I was wrong.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.720]   But I guess, so the idea is,
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.900]   let's say you want to have a year's worth of cash
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.840]   in something and you're right in the past,
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.240]   you would have taken that year's worth of cash out
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.720]   and go, oh great, I'm earning nothing on my cash.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.040]   Now you can earn something on it.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.840]   So you know what your 12 months or 18 months
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.280]   or 24 months of spending is gonna be.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.480]   You can plan that out, you know, pretty close these days.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.040]   It's not as far out.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.080]   Then you put that into a T-bill and as it matures,
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.440]   you kind of can spend it, right?
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.040]   'Cause you buy the T-bill at a discount
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.960]   and then it matures at face value.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.760]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:47.640]   I mean, it's a little more tricky
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.380]   because, you know, you have to like plan out
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.600]   exactly what you're gonna spend
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.280]   and spending's never so linear.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.480]   It's usually more lumpy, right?
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.360]   So it can be difficult, but you know,
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.600]   that would definitely work, though,
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.600]   if you can kind of try and anticipate your spending a bit.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.920]   - Yeah, and we've talked about this before
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.400]   where the way that I like to think about
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   like an asset allocation in retirement is like,
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.080]   how much money do you want in safe assets?
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.280]   And that can be tied to how much,
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.440]   so if you use the 4% rule to spend
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.120]   and you have a 60/40 portfolio for current spending needs,
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.140]   you have roughly 10 years worth if you're in that 40%, right?
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.420]   If it's some sort of short-term bonds or cash
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.640]   or, you know, not long-term bonds by any means.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.820]   But I think that's kind of a way to think about it.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.700]   And then getting into your micromanaging is,
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.280]   then how do I deal with this short-term cash?
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.880]   And I'd love to see a study on how many people actually do.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.040]   I'm guessing most people sell
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.160]   at the beginning of the year, right?
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.240]   Or the end of the year.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.440]   Some periodic time point where they lock in
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.880]   and say, I'm gonna have my spending there
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.440]   'cause I don't want it to move around in the meantime.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.900]   - You actually know what most people do?
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.960]   They've done a study on this.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.440]   So people with portfolios, right?
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.520]   So 40% of retirees don't even have a portfolio.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.820]   They basically, Americans,
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.320]   they just live off social security, right?
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.720]   Which is unfortunate in its own right.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.920]   But of those that have portfolios, the other 60%,
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.200]   you know, five and seven
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.760]   actually never touch their principal balance, right?
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.320]   They actually just live off their investment income.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.760]   So it's a very simple rule.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.000]   It's like, okay, if my investments
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.520]   are bringing in X dollars a month,
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.860]   I live off of that basically.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.560]   And the principal balance usually keeps growing.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.020]   So they never spend,
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.000]   very rarely do people spend down principal.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.720]   It's a very small percentage of retirees
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.560]   that are actually spending down principal.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.400]   - And this is the hot take from your book
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.320]   where you said most people, if you're a big saver,
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.000]   you're probably saving way too much money.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.400]   And because of this idea that most retirees never spend it
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.840]   because they can't force themselves to spend it.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.200]   So spend more now.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.320]   - Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.960]   So it's kind of, it's not die with zero,
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.080]   but I'm saying die with zero is like directionally accurate.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.360]   I actually hadn't read the book at the time
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.440]   or otherwise I would have thrown it in there.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.240]   But yeah, it's like, it's moving towards that idea.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.200]   - Your book would be like die with 25%.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.400]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.360]   I think die with zero is a little rough
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.200]   for a lot of people.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.880]   So I think there's some negative reactions to it,
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.460]   but I think he's directionally accurate.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.280]   Like we are just like moving too much
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.200]   in one direction versus the other, right?
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.940]   And I think one more, one quick thing.
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.240]   Michael Kitsies did this study, right?
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.440]   He found that over, you know, over a 30 year time period
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.540]   using the 4% rule on a 60/40,
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.120]   you're more likely to 4X your portfolio
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.840]   than to go below the beginning balance.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.160]   So if you start with a million dollars,
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.480]   you're more likely to have $4 million in 30 years
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.760]   than you're to be below a million.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.200]   So, and that's with you spending money in everything, right?
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.400]   So I just, upside surprises happen.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.820]   And I think people don't realize that
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.920]   when they go into retirement.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.140]   - Well, people don't realize that also,
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.800]   like the 4% rule studies,
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.040]   those are looking at worst case scenarios, right?
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.240]   So you're right, that's on like the extreme left tail.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.920]   Most of the time you're going to grow your money
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   because most of the time markets go up, right?
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.440]   Okay, since we have Nick here, let's do a,
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.400]   we put him to work here.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   Let's do a more data-heavy one as well.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.680]   - Okay, up next we have a question
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   from McFly_Marty, so I'm guessing this is social media.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.320]   - Great Twitter handle there.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.920]   - Yeah, does the S&P 500 dividend yield keep pace
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.700]   with short-term treasury interest rates
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.800]   during a Fed hiking cycle?
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.640]   One would think that these corporations
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.100]   have to compete with the government
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.440]   to attract investment dollars,
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.600]   and there should be a correlation.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.840]   - I like this, I like this question.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.320]   I put this one in here because
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.160]   I've never really thought about it,
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.000]   but it makes sense.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.520]   So John, do a quick chart on here.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.220]   This is stock bond and cash returns by decade.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.060]   I just have this chart,
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.160]   but it also shows earnings growth,
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.500]   annualized earnings growth.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.800]   And you can see 2010s were great,
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.980]   which wasn't a lot of inflation or interest rates hiking,
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:20.200]   but the other high decades were the 1970s and 1940s.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.000]   So what those two decades have in common
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.520]   is inflation was high and interest rates were rising.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.840]   So it would make sense to me
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.040]   that if earnings are rising,
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.400]   that dividends will be rising too,
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.280]   but I've never really looked into this.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.200]   So Nick, we put you to the test here.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.920]   What did we find?
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.520]   - Yeah, so I did a quick analysis on this,
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.920]   and basically it's a difficult question
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.280]   because there's a lot of moving parts,
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.360]   but generally when the Fed goes to hike really quickly,
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.440]   like stock prices do drop a little bit.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.960]   And so if you think about what is a dividend yield,
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.920]   it's like dividend over price.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.200]   So let's say if a stock was priced at 100
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.280]   and it's paying $5 in dividend per share,
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.000]   that's a 5% dividend yield.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.640]   So if prices drop by, just because of that,
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.680]   how that ratio works,
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.160]   like the dividend yield is gonna go up.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.200]   So generally you see,
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   I know I put together a graph that looks at this.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.800]   I looked at a bunch of different hiking cycles,
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.960]   like going back to like, I think the 1970s.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.220]   So the Fed target rate is there on the X-axis.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.980]   So as the rate's going up,
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.280]   so in every one of these colored things,
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.520]   the rate is going up.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.880]   So what should we expect with dividend yield
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.400]   is like, is the dividend yield moving up
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.880]   as the dots are moving to the right within each color?
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.640]   And the answer is generally yes,
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.760]   but it's not always perfect.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.560]   And so what you're seeing is like,
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.880]   as the Fed's raising rates,
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.920]   like dividends yield tend to go up only,
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.400]   I think some of that is because of the price impact, right?
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.600]   So yes, it's true that like, you know,
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.440]   corporations are like,
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.860]   oh, I wanna offer more dividends to be attractive.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.120]   But the fact is if your price drops
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.380]   and your dividends don't change,
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.240]   your dividend yield has gone up, right?
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.700]   And so because of that,
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.040]   like just naturally through this process,
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.760]   and we saw this happen in this hiking cycle, right?
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.040]   Stock prices got hit as the Fed started to hike.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:56.880]   And guess what?
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.320]   Dividend yields went up, right?
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.360]   Because all else equal,
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.520]   if they didn't cut dividends,
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.640]   dividend yields went up, right?
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.480]   So that's--
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.600]   - It probably operates on a lag too.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.520]   If earnings are rising,
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.480]   it's not like companies are automatically
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.520]   increasing dividends right away.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.120]   They do so on a very slow stair-step approach.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.940]   They probably don't do it very quickly, right?
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:12.780]   - Exactly.
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:13.600]   I would love to look into this more,
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.720]   but you know, it's a quick analysis,
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.560]   trying to get an answer.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.640]   But yeah, I think generally they are correlated
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.460]   just through that mechanism of like,
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.400]   as price drops,
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.420]   a dividend yield tends to go up just very quickly.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.160]   But yeah, over the long haul,
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.000]   I don't know,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.040]   like I don't think corporations are thinking,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.400]   oh, treasurers are paying this,
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.640]   we have to pay more now.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.080]   I don't think that's the,
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.000]   I don't think that's a thing that like,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.920]   is going through a lot of, you know,
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.920]   the minds of those in corporate strategy
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.760]   and things like that.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.580]   - It's funny because that--
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.420]   - We're gonna do what's best for the business, right?
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.960]   - That used to be the case back in like the 1920s,
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.080]   '30s, '40s is that stocks offered way,
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.760]   like five, six, 7% dividend yields
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.940]   'cause they were competing with bonds.
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.120]   'Cause no one knew what the actual price returns were,
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.160]   so they had to.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.000]   And now you're right.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.040]   They don't care about that as much anymore.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.120]   - Yeah, the data's out there.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.960]   And so people know that stocks generally return
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.800]   more than bonds,
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.080]   so they don't have to pay as much now to do that.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.440]   - Yeah, well, that was a pretty chart.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.400]   Nick makes some of the prettiest charts in all finance.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.720]   - Thank you. - So that was nice.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.880]   - Yeah, I was just telling everyone in the chat
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.000]   to be sure to check out,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.400]   Nick just wrote a good piece
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.440]   about how housing prices got to where they are.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.680]   So go check that out.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.120]   - Thank you.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.160]   - Perfect, okay.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.200]   Thanks, Nick, for coming on the show.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.360]   We always appreciate it.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.200]   And if you haven't yet,
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.060]   check out Nick's book, "Just Keep Buying."
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.880]   He's got a really tiny copy over his shoulder.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.720]   - I'm plugging it.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.560]   (laughing)
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.840]   We're in the spare office.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.680]   I'm like plugging this thing.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.520]   - It's perspective.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.940]   It's not a tiny copy.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.040]   (laughing)
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.520]   - Remember, you can email us.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.280]   Yeah, that's like the Leaning Tower of Pisa
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.120]   kind of thing.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:35.960]   - Right, exactly.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.200]   Yeah, thanks, guys, for having me on.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.040]   It's always great.
