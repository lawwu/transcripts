[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   We've been talking about thoughts recently, our thought lives.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Friday we asked if God can read our thoughts, and the resounding answer is yes, God can read our thoughts.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   And not only our thoughts, but also the intentions of our hearts.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   And that fact carries vast implications for each of us.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   It means God can see the difference between what we want to say and what we actually do say.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   He can actually weigh that difference, and so we can glorify God by stopping sinful words from exiting our mouth.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   It's one of the fascinating implications that we looked at on Friday in ABJ 1917.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   And we're going to start this new week with another short but profoundly important question about our thought lives.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   It's asked by Garrick, "Pastor John, can Satan himself put thoughts into our heads?"
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Yes, he can, and he does.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And of course, the urgent questions then are, well, how do we recognize them, and how do we resist them?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   They'll get controlled by them.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   But before I give some biblical examples of this, it would be good to remind ourselves that Satan's putting thoughts in our minds
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   and putting desires in our hearts or our bodies are very closely related.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Sometimes he may put desires for something sinful directly into our hearts, followed by thoughts that justify those sinful desires.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And sometimes he may do the reverse by putting deceptive thoughts in our minds that lead to sinful desires.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Now, Garrick only asked about thoughts, but I just wanted to make plain that thoughts and desires are so closely related,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   we should be asking about both. So, I'll keep that in mind.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Let's start with the biblical text that actually uses the words that Garrick used in posing his question,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   namely, does Satan actually put thoughts in our minds?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And here's John 13, verse 2.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   "During the supper," that is, during the last supper,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   "the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him."
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   So, the thought, the intention, the desire was there in Judas.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   "Satan," John says, "put it there."
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Now, here's another clarification, though.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   That does not mean, it doesn't mean for Judas, it doesn't mean for us,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   that the intention and the desire did not arise out of Judas's own sinful nature.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   He's described in John 12, 6 as a thief who's taking money out of the disciples' money bag.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And it says he's a person who had no heart for the poor, which means he was also a liar, which also means he was greedy.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   So, we can infer pretty certainly from this that Jesus was not the kind of Messiah Judas wanted to follow.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   He had other things going on in his mind and heart.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   All Satan had to do was intensify and direct Judas's own sinfulness.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And that's true with us as well.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   There's no clear, fine line between the thoughts that Satan puts and the thoughts that we come up with,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   or the desires that Satan puts and the desires that we come up with.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   So, we don't know exactly how.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   It's these "how" questions that baffle us, isn't it?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   We don't know exactly how Satan interacts with our own sinful nature to do his ugly work.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   But I think it is fair to say that our own sinfulness is like an invitation, like a welcome mat, and an open door to Satan.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   That's what Paul says in Ephesians 4, 26.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   He says, "Don't let the sun go down on your anger. Don't give opportunity to the devil."
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   In other words, sinfully holding a grudge is like a welcome mat put out for Satan.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And it works the other way around.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   When Satan beckons us to sin with deceptive thoughts or desires,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   our own sinful nature kicks in and makes those beckonings more attractive.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   So, here's another biblical example to answer Garrick's question.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Does Satan put things in our heart?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Here's Acts 5, verse 3, where Ananias and Sapphira decide to lie to the apostles and keep back part of their pledge.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land?"
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   So, Ananias and his wife had the thought,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   "Ah, let's make a little extra money for ourselves by lying about how much we sold our land for."
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And the thought became a plan, and the plan became a deed,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and Peter describes that whole process as "Satan filled your hearts."
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Satan caused the plan to appear more desirable than honesty or worship.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Satan's design filled them up and conquered all their other thoughts and desires.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   It was a pretty costly sin.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Another example is how Satan moved King David to take a census in Israel against God's will.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   1 Chronicles 21.1, "Then Satan stood up against Israel and incited David to number Israel."
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   That is, to take a census of Israel.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   He put the thought in David's mind, and he made the thought look like military wisdom
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   when it was in fact distrust in God.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And eventually, he had to repent of that folly.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And we might think, as we go back to the very beginning of the Bible,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   that the deception of Eve in the Garden of Eden was not like the way Satan works today
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   because it was by means of an actual conversation between the devil and Adam and Eve, or Eve.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   But Paul said that Christians must be on guard against a similar assault,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   just like in the Garden of Eden.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   He said in 2 Corinthians 11.3,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   "I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ."
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   So here, Satan's work in our minds is called leading us astray, corrupting our thoughts.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   So, we don't know how Satan does it, but there it is.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   He does it.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   He can ruin and distort and mislead our thoughts and turn them into thoughts against Christ and for sin.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Now, the main reality to keep in mind in all this is that Satan is a deceiver, a liar, a murderer.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   He works his destruction mainly by deceiving, by lying,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   sometimes with half-truths, but always with deceptive, murderous intent.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Here's Revelation 12.9 that says,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   "The great dragon was thrown down, the ancient serpent,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world."
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And John 8.44 says, "The devil was a murderer from the beginning
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   When he lies, he speaks out of his own character,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   for he is a liar and the father of lies."
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   All his thoughts, in other words, are misleading.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   They're misleading thoughts, whether they're half-truths or whole falsehoods.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   They're misleading.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   All his miracles are lying miracles, that is, miracles in the service of a lie,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   which means that the central and steady-state weapon against him is truth,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   faith in the truth.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Here's the way Paul says that.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   2 Timothy 2:25-26.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   "We should correct our opponents with gentleness.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth,"
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   and here's the effect of that,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   "and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil."
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   That's how he does it, knowledge of the truth.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Jesus said, "You'll know the truth and the truth will set you free."
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Let me keep reading.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I stopped in the middle of verse 26.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   "They may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   after being captured by him to do his will."
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   How did he capture them?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   How did Satan capture them?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   By trapping them with lies.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Untruth persuaded them to believe a lie, but putting lies--he put lies in their hearts--
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   by deceiving them that error is better than truth, sin is better than righteousness.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And the remedy, Paul says, is speak the truth and show righteous love,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   and that's exactly what we get in Ephesians 6, verses 11 to 18.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   "Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil."
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And then six pieces of armor are mentioned, and four of the six relate directly to truth
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   because the schemes of the devil are lies, and we protect ourselves and others with the truth.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Number one, the belt of truth.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Number two, shoes of the gospel.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Three, sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Four, shield of faith, which is the faith in the Word of God.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   You have the Word of God in your hand like a sword, and you put the shield up,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   and you trust the Word of God, the truth.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   So I think the answer to Garrick's question is pretty clear.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Yes, Satan can put thoughts in our minds, but God has given us everything we need
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   to recognize them and renounce them.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Here are the questions I think we need to ask of every thought that comes into our mind.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   One, is this thought false to Scripture?
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Two, is this thought false to the glory of Christ?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Three, is this thought false to Christ honoring love for others?
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Four, is this thought false to purity?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Five, is this thought serving to make sin attractive and to make holiness unattractive?
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   If the answer to any of those questions is yes, then we remember Revelation 12, 11,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   where John says, "They have conquered Satan by the blood of the Lamb
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   and by the word of their testimony, for they love not their lives, even unto death."
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   In other words, we turn to Christ, who loved us and gave himself for us,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   and we take hold of precious promises that he's given of his superior worth and helpfulness,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   and we testify to Satan, "Christ is my truth. Christ is my treasure. Be gone."
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   And we turn and we walk with Christ in the truth.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Fascinating. Yeah, John 13, 2 is so profound.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   "Satan puts the thoughts and the desires into Judas's mind and heart."
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Wow, that's a haunting text. John 13, 2 is haunting, and it's only appeared on the podcast twice now.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   The first time was just back in December.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   "What can Satan do to Christians?" That was APJ 1869.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   "What can Satan do to Christians?" 1869, if you want more on this theme.
