[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   I am constantly surprised at how cheap it is to get to Hawaii, at least from the West Coast.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.280]   For anyone who's looking to fly to Hawaii from somewhere else and doesn't see cheap flights,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.320]   I would encourage you to look from San Francisco, Oakland, LA, and see if you can find a cheap
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.800]   flight there that you might have to buy a separate flight to connect to, because our flights ended up
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.400]   being less than $300 round trip, and they kept dropping over the course of time. So once I booked
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.240]   our flights, they got automatically imported in to TripIt, and I just got these email alerts,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.640]   "Oh, your flight's down $20. Great. We'll rebook it and get $20 of credit per person. Oh, your
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.600]   flight's dropped again." And so at that price, it wasn't even worth trying to use miles to book the
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600]   flight because it was just such a good deal.
