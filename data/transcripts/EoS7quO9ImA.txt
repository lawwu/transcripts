[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   counseling, and we're so glad that you've joined us on this webinar. Hope you had a wonderful
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.520]   Sunday worshiping our Lord Jesus Christ. This is our 17th class meeting, and we are working our way
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:21.440]   through the ACBC Theology exams. We are on Theology exam number 17 tonight, which has to do
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.080]   with the doctrine of repentance, and I trust that this is going to be a wonderful study for each of
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.760]   us, both to apply to our own lives and then also to use in counseling ministry to others. So thank
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.560]   you so much for joining us tonight. I hope that your studies are going well and that the Lord is
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.760]   blessing your essay exams, and we're just so excited about all that the Lord is doing to
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.720]   train biblical counselors for His glory. We are here at Kindred about to open five
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.440]   dedicated counseling spaces that are soundproofed and private in our church offices, and I'm
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.680]   so excited to be able to show those offices to you, Lord willing, in the next couple weeks,
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.040]   and we're praying that God will fill those rooms with counselors who will be able to minister
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.000]   God's truth and His word to others, and this all is part of that process. So thank you for
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.040]   your faithfulness and for your encouragement as we continue to work through this class.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.360]   Well, as I mentioned, tonight we are looking at the doctrine of repentance
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.080]   tonight, which is a very important subject and also one that is very practical for
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.400]   each of our lives. Martin Luther has well said that our Lord and Master Jesus Christ
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.160]   willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance, and so all of life, according to
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:06.720]   Martin Luther, is repentance, and I think that is reflected in the essay exam that we'll look at
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.800]   tonight. The Christian life begins with repentance, turning from sin and turning to Christ,
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.360]   and then the Christian progresses in the Christian life as the believer repents of sin and
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:32.240]   embraces Christ on a daily basis, and that is true for you. That is true for me as well. Each of us
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:41.760]   grow as we continue to repent of sin and as we continue to embrace Christ by faith, and that
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.040]   is true for our counselees. Our counselees will make progress in the counseling issue that they
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:58.640]   face as they learn to repent of sin and embrace Christ by faith, and so this is a really an
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.520]   important topic for each of us to look at and to think deeply upon, and that is why this is in the
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:15.760]   theology essay exams. Just far from being a kind of a morose and depressing subject, I hope you'll
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.840]   find that the doctrine of repentance really is the doctrine that leads us to joy. It is the doctrine
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:34.160]   that leads us to true blessing in Christ. I can't think of a more morose or depressing person than
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:43.200]   the Christian who does not repent of sin. Repentance really is the path to joy, and I think
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.520]   that's reflected in David's statement in Psalm 32, verse 1, where David said, "Blessed is the one
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.160]   whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man against whom the
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:06.960]   Lord counts no iniquity and in whose spirit there is no deceit," and then David goes on to describe
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:15.280]   a period of his life where he had hidden his sin from the Lord, and he describes this period as a
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:25.600]   period of spiritual misery, a period of spiritual depression. He says in verse 3, "For when I kept
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.240]   silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night your hand was
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.360]   heavy upon me. My strength was dried up as by the heat of summer," and so this period in which David
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:52.000]   did not repent of his sin was definitely a period in which he was lacking joy, but then in verse 5,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.520]   we see David's repentance, and David says this, "I acknowledge my sin to you, and I did not cover
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:08.400]   my iniquity. I said I will confess my transgressions to the Lord, and you forgave the iniquity of my
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:18.560]   sin." I think we see in that wonderful psalm that repentance was the key for David to experience
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.720]   joy and spiritual blessings in the Lord, and the same could be said to be true for you
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:37.120]   and for me. We see that the doctrine of repentance is really connected with the truth of God's grace.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.640]   God does a wonderful work of grace in the sinner's heart in opening the sinner's eyes
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:52.560]   and helping a person see his or her sin before the cross, and then helping that person to turn
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:06:00.160]   from sin and to embrace all that Christ has done for us through his work on the cross and his
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:08.160]   glorious resurrection. This is a wonderful work of God that God performs in each person's heart,
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:15.920]   and it is the pathway to joy and blessing. So, I hope to kind of do away with this idea that to
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:25.600]   study repentance is to study this gloomy topic, this kind of brooding and morose spiritual topic
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.960]   that leads us just to kind of despair over our sin. I hope you will embrace the doctrine of
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:40.960]   repentance as a doctrine that leads us to joy and to blessing. So, let me give us this
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:52.000]   introductory thought as we open our class together. I want to just read from 2 Timothy 2 verses 24 to
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.600]   26, Paul's encouragement to Timothy, and then draw some implications, some applications to
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:07.200]   counseling ministry, and I love this passage. By the way, my senior pastor, Philip DeCourcy,
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:14.960]   has a killer message on this from 2 Timothy 2 verses 24 to 26, and he preached that at the
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.040]   Master's Seminary Chapel and also at Kindred Church. I would encourage you to pick that up
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:28.080]   online or download that. It's for free, but he really did a great job expositing this passage,
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.520]   and it's a wonderful passage connecting the doctrine of repentance to how the Lord's servant
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:44.800]   ought to behave. In that passage, the Apostle Paul tells Timothy this. He says, "And the Lord's
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:53.520]   servant must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.800]   correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance,
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:09.040]   leading to a knowledge of the truth, and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:19.840]   of the devil after being captured by him to do his will." I just want to focus on that one thought
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:32.320]   for a moment that repentance is the gift of God. Repentance is a gift from God. You see there that
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:45.520]   Paul tells Timothy God may perhaps grant them repentance, meaning that God must work in a
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:54.480]   person's heart and grant them to see the enormity of their sin, grant them to see the work of Christ
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:04.880]   on the cross. He must grant them to, as Paul says here, come to their senses and grant them this
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:14.480]   work of grace in which they turn from their sin and they turn to follow Christ. Repentance is
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.960]   a gift from God. Now, we call people to repentance, and you see throughout
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.680]   the New Testament Scriptures as well as the Old Testament Scriptures that
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:37.120]   the Bible calls people to repent of their sin, and so repentance is a human responsibility.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.760]   We are given the responsibility to repent and to believe in Christ,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:49.520]   but that truth needs to be balanced with this whole idea that repentance is the gift of God.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:56.560]   In other words, when you see a person repent of his or her sin, you are seeing the work of God
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:08.560]   in a person's heart. God is the one who grants repentance. Some other verses that are related to
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:16.880]   this theme include Romans 2, verse 4, where Paul says, "Do you presume on the riches of his kindness
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:26.880]   and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?"
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:35.600]   In Acts 11, verse 18, says this, "When they heard these things, they fell silent, and they glorified
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:46.240]   God, saying then to the Gentiles, 'Also, God has granted repentance that leads to life.'"
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:53.360]   God is the one who grants repentance, so when you counsel someone and that
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:11:03.520]   counselee sees his or her sin and humbles himself before the cross, repents of sin,
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:10.000]   and has a changed life, what you don't do is go home and pat yourself on the back and say,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.520]   "What a wonderful counselor I was. It was my ability that meant the difference
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:24.320]   in leading this person to repentance." Now, God may have used you in a wonderful way,
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:32.960]   but ultimately what you do is you go home and you praise God, and you thank God that He has
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:42.240]   granted repentance to the person you are ministering to. Now, what are the implications
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:51.920]   of this truth for the counselor's conduct, the truth that God is the one who grants repentance?
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:58.720]   Well, Paul tells us in 2 Timothy 2, verse 24, "The Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome."
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:11.280]   We must not be quarrelsome. When we engage in counseling ministry with people, we are
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:19.920]   oftentimes working with people who are blinded to their own sin. They can't see their own
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:28.240]   contribution to a conflict, for example, or they can't see how they have contributed to
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:37.440]   a difficult situation. Oftentimes, we deal with counselees who are really stubborn in not wanting
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:45.920]   to turn to the Lord in faith. You may even work with counselees who argue with you, or who dispute
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:53.440]   with you, or just who say they don't agree. And even most painfully of all, at times, counselees
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:13:02.000]   will actually divert the attention from their own behavior by criticizing the counselor's
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.120]   qualifications or skill set. And so, some counselees even get real personal,
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:18.720]   and they blame you for their lack of repentance or spiritual growth. What you have to remember in
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:26.960]   those seasons and in those situations is that the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:38.000]   We don't engage in this kind of prideful disputing. Instead, we pray that God will
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.560]   open the counselee's eyes to see their sin and to see their need of repentance. We don't allow
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:54.560]   the issue to become defending ourselves. But as Paul says, the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome,
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:05.040]   but kind to everyone. A word meaning to be gentle or mild or peaceable. The word kind was used to
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:14.800]   describe a medicine that was soothing or assuaging. And it says here that the Lord's bondservant must
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:23.760]   be kind to who? To everyone. Every counselee that you will minister to
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:34.240]   is a counselee that must be treated with kindness. The Lord's bondservant must be able to teach
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:43.680]   patiently, enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness. And then Paul says, "God may
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.280]   perhaps grant them repentance, leading to a knowledge of the truth that they may," and this
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.360]   is the same language that was used of the prodigal son in Luke chapter 15, "that they may come to
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:07.280]   their senses." Sin is irrational. People lose themselves when they are caught in sin. They
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:15.840]   don't know their way out. They lose all perspective on life. And they will even hurt anyone who tries
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:22.320]   to help them come out of that situation. But we pray for our counselees that they may come to
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:31.360]   their senses. That their hearts would be awakened with the truth of God's word. And Paul even says,
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:39.600]   holds out the prospect of the person escaping from the snare of the devil after being captured
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:48.720]   by him to do his will. So there is spiritual warfare in the ministry of biblical counseling.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:59.280]   We are fighting against the demonic realm, and we use the truth of God to work on people's hearts.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:09.760]   And so we engage in this ministry desiring to lead people to repentance, and we pray that God
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:18.240]   will grant them repentance. Now I've been very honest with you all in saying that I'm not an
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:26.560]   expert biblical counselor by any means. I have my share of failures and shortcomings in this
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:34.240]   ministry, but I have done it counseling enough to know that there are times in the counseling
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.360]   ministry where you're sitting with a believer in Christ, and you're opening God's word,
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:46.080]   and you're just conversing about the issues of life, and the Holy Spirit does a work in the
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:53.920]   counselee's heart. And there's this aha moment, or there is some realization of the truth, or there
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:17:00.240]   is some understanding of something that the counseling never saw before, and there is a heart
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:06.960]   change that takes place. Even sitting with a married couple where they're at odds with one
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:12.560]   another and fighting and arguing over different things, and you minister the truth of God's word,
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.480]   and there's a moment in that counseling session where the husband or the wife reaches out and
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:25.920]   holds the other spouse's hand, and there is contrition, there is humility, there is
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:35.040]   brokenness, confession of sin, and reconciliation, and God grants repentance, and you get to see it.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:45.120]   You get to be a first row seat and view to see this work of God that takes place. And I'll just
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:53.120]   tell you that those moments, you fight hard for them. It takes a lot of labor to get there,
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:59.040]   but when you're privileged to be able to sit in those moments, you look back, and you look back
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.760]   on the essays that you worked your way through, and you look back at all the training that you
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:10.000]   went through in phase one and phase two of ACBC training, and it's all worth it. It's all worth
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:21.040]   it to be part of this work of God where someone's life is different because you are able to bring
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:29.280]   the word of God to bear in the ministry of biblical counseling. And so this is a wonderful
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:35.600]   ministry. God does grant repentance is what I would encourage you with, and when he does,
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.960]   it is a beautiful thing to see. So let me pray for us briefly, and then we'll dive into our notes
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:47.760]   and look at the essay exam tonight. Let's pray. Father, thank you for the truth that you do
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:55.680]   indeed grant repentance. This is an expression of your grace and your favor toward us. You do
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:08.240]   change hearts. You do awaken eyes. You do soften people's attitudes. You do change lives through
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:15.200]   your word, and we thank you that it is your kindness that leads us to repentance. We pray
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:22.480]   that, Father, you would help us to apply this doctrine to our own lives first. As Luther said,
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:29.520]   all of life is repentance. Help us to be daily repenting of sin and embracing Christ through faith
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:38.640]   that we ourselves may be a model of the things we wish to see in the lives of our counselees.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:44.320]   Thank you for each student in this class. Bless them richly. Thank you for their faithfulness.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:50.240]   Thank you for our time together. Work in our hearts. Through your word, we pray in Jesus' name.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:58.640]   Amen. Amen. All right, we are looking at the essay exam tonight, which is "Describe the
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.160]   Role of Repentance in Beginning and Continuing the Christian Life,"
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:08.640]   and the question is to explain the importance of the doctrine of repentance for
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:17.760]   biblical counseling. On your handout, you have the normal reading from Wayne Grudem,
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:25.360]   Paul Enns, and Heath Lambert, and in addition to those three resources, I sent you a Dropbox
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:32.720]   link with a few other handouts that I think you'll find helpful in your study of this
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:39.120]   topic. There's a reading there by J.C. Ryle on the doctrine of repentance, very helpful.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:46.720]   Everything from Ryle is very helpful in our understanding of these topics.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:54.160]   And then I would especially commend to you the worksheet that was created by Brad Bigney. It's
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:03.440]   called "True Repentance and Its Impact." That is a worksheet that we use in our biblical counseling
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:11.680]   ministry here at Kindred. I think it's available for free off the church, their church's website,
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:19.440]   and it's just a worksheet that helps a counselee walk through the doctrine of repentance. It has
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:25.920]   some fill-in-the-blanks that a counselee can fill out and make practical application of this
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:34.640]   doctrine to their lives, and just a very helpful work. We'll cover some of the material in the
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:40.320]   next few minutes that's on that handout, but if you want a handout to give to a counselee
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.600]   to help them work through repentance, that would be a good one to use.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:53.520]   And so, just a number of good resources on the topic of repentance. So, you'll know that this
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:22:01.840]   question really has three different elements. The first is to describe the role of repentance in the
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:10.240]   beginning of the Christian life. So, what is the role of repentance in conversion, the gospel call
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:16.720]   to repent and believe? Then you have the second element, which is to describe the role of
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:24.080]   repentance in continuing the Christian life. So, we begin our Christian lives by repenting of sin
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:31.440]   and believing in the gospel, and then we continue the Christian life as we repent on a daily basis
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:37.600]   and embrace Christ through faith in our sanctification. And then the third element
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.480]   of the question is to explain the importance of the doctrine of repentance for biblical
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:50.080]   counseling. Now, you don't have to answer the question in that order. If you want to do so,
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:58.080]   you're more than welcome to break up your essay into those three portions, but you don't have to
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:04.640]   do that. You can do a general discussion of repentance, but in some point of your essay,
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:10.480]   you're going to want to address the question, how would you use the doctrine of repentance in
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:16.880]   counseling others? Why is this doctrine so important in biblical counseling ministry?
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:22.720]   And so, if you pick apart the elements of the question, those would be the three
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:32.880]   elements that the question is looking for. Now, let me move to the next page of your
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:42.000]   handout here and just look at the doctrine of repentance. Wayne Grudem has given this
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.560]   definition for repentance. I believe it's an excellent one. He says that repentance is a
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:56.400]   heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:04.080]   in obedience to Christ. So, repentance includes a heartfelt sorrow for sin,
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:11.120]   a renouncing of that sin, and then a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:19.840]   to Christ. If you've been with us in our study, we looked at the three components of faith.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:29.040]   There was an intellectual aspect, there was an emotional aspect, and there was a volitional
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:40.080]   aspect of faith. Faith understands certain truths to be relevant. Faith emotionally embraces those
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:46.000]   truths in application to the person's heart, and then there's a volitional aspect of faith where
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:55.920]   faith places one's confidence or trust in a certain person or thing. And so, those categories
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:03.360]   of intellectual, emotional, and volitional. Now, we'll find when it comes to repentance that those
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:12.240]   categories are applicable to our understanding of this doctrine as well. This isn't on your handout,
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:19.280]   but I'll put it up on the screen here. Repentance includes those three aspects. There is an
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:27.280]   intellectual understanding that sin is wrong. There is an emotional approval of the teachings
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:35.200]   of Scripture regarding sin, and then there is a personal decision to turn from sin and seek
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:43.040]   forgiveness from God. So, there's a similarity there to the three aspects of saving faith,
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:52.240]   intellectual, emotional, and volitional. If you look at your handout, we'll see these three
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:59.840]   categories being addressed by different passages in Scripture. We see the emotional aspect of
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:06.000]   repentance addressed in Matthew 5, verse 4, where Jesus says, "Blessed are those who mourn,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:15.680]   for they shall be comforted." There is a legitimate type of mourning and sorrow in the heart of
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:26.480]   a sinner who understands his or her sin before holy God. It's not just the worldly sorrow of
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:36.320]   mourning over the consequences of sin. It is a legitimate sorrow that is really born out of that
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:44.560]   statement in Psalm 51, verse 5, "Against you and you alone I have sinned." It is the understanding
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:51.520]   that I've sinned against a holy God. It is the understanding that I violated His laws. I have
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:59.840]   dishonored Him, and there is a mourning. There is a sorrow that takes place in the sinner's heart.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:07.040]   Notice here that not all sorrow is equivalent to true repentance.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:14.880]   Saul was sorry for his sin. He said, "I have sinned," but he did not
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:23.200]   repent of that sin back in the Old Testament. Judas felt remorse for his sin in betraying Christ,
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:34.160]   but he did not repent of that sin, and so not all emotion or sorrow equals true repentance.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:39.040]   There are people who feel sorry over the consequences of their sin, that they've lost
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:47.520]   their job, or they've lost their marriage, or they've lost their privileges, but it's not the
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:56.960]   true contrition of a believer who sees his or her sin as an affront against a holy God. Or as a
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:07.280]   believer, one is sorry for, "I have sinned against my heavenly Father who so loves me and cares for
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:16.400]   me," but there is a sorrow when it comes to true repentance. And Jesus actually, far from discouraging
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:25.440]   that type of sorrow, He pronounces a blessing upon those who mourn. "Blessed are those who mourn,
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:34.320]   for they shall be comforted." So you see there the emotional aspect of true repentance. You also see
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:42.000]   a volitional aspect to true repentance. In Luke 18 verse 13, Jesus spoke of the tax collector who
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.880]   was repentant, and it says that the tax collector standing far off would not even lift up his eyes
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:56.000]   to heaven, but beat his breast saying, "God be merciful to me, a sinner." So here we see both
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:03.840]   the emotional aspect of repentance and the volitional aspect of repentance.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:15.600]   He cried out for mercy. He was broken over his sin, and back in those days, the tax collector,
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:23.200]   that was one of the most public and notorious of sins, to be defrauding your own people of
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:32.400]   finances, of money, under the authority of a Roman oppressor. And so a tax collector was not
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:41.520]   only viewed as a financial cheater, but also as a traitor to one's people. But here you have one who
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:47.840]   is a notorious sinner, at least in a public sense, and he's crying out for mercy. "God be merciful to
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:55.520]   me, a sinner." And Jesus contrasts that expression of repentance to the words of the Pharisee who
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:01.120]   said in that same passage, "God, I thank you that I am not like other men," and went on to
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:09.440]   list the ways that he was superior to others. So just a practical note there for counseling
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:18.880]   ministry. I would much rather in counseling minister to someone, a counselee, who has a
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:27.040]   serious and somewhat notorious sin, but who has a broken and contrite heart.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:37.760]   I'd much rather minister to that person than minister to someone who may have a less
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.080]   serious sin, at least in regards to public reputation,
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:49.040]   but who puffs himself or herself up in pride and self-righteousness, and is so blinded
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:56.320]   by self-righteousness that he can't see his sin and just says, "Well, at least I'm not like other
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:02.800]   sinners. I know I'm a husband who needs to grow, but at least I'm not like those other husbands
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.200]   who don't even have a job or who don't even provide for their family. I know I have an anger
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:14.480]   problem, but at least I'm not like other people who can't get their lives right in certain areas."
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:21.600]   I'd much rather minister to the counselee who says, "Here is my sin, and I'm broken over my sin,
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:27.760]   and God be merciful to me, a sinner, and I need to grow, and I need to change," than one who is
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:34.080]   afflicted with self-righteousness, and part of counseling ministry is engaging in that spiritual
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:45.280]   battle to pray for a person's self-righteousness to be broken, and that perhaps is the most
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:56.000]   damaging sin of all, is to be so self-righteous in your pride that you can't see your sin,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:06.160]   and you can't repent of your sin. Luke 19 verse 8 is a beautiful picture of repentance. This
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:12.720]   would highlight all three aspects, the intellectual, emotional, and volitional aspects of
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:19.680]   repentance. Verse 8 says, "And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, 'Behold, Lord, the half of my
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:25.760]   goods I give to the poor, and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.' And
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.960]   Jesus said to him, 'Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham,
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:39.440]   for the Son of Man came to seek and save the lost.'" So, here's how you know a person is
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:47.520]   repentant. A person is repentant when you have to say to them, "That's too much. You don't need to
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:54.320]   restore things fourfold." I mean, restore things one-fold would be good enough, but the heart of
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:33:01.840]   true repentance is a desire to do anything that it would take to make things right before God and
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:13.120]   before others. And we do see that in counseling ministry, when God does this work, that a person
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:21.600]   goes from saying, "How little can I get away with?" to saying, "How much can I do to show that I am
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:30.960]   truly sorry for my sin?" John the Baptist preached a message of repentance in Luke 3, verse 8. He
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:37.600]   said, "Bear fruits in keeping with repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:43.440]   Abraham as our father,' for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.800]   Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the foot of the trees. Every tree, therefore, that does not
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:55.360]   bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire." Now, watch this. John the Baptist preached
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:03.280]   like a biblical counselor. Or should I say that we should counsel in accordance with
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:09.040]   John the Baptist preaching? Because in verse 10, it says that the crowds asked him,
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:16.080]   "What then shall we do?" And John the Baptist didn't say to that question, "Well, as long as
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.160]   you just feel really bad about it or you feel really sorry for your sin, that's good enough
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:28.800]   for God." Repentance is a turning. It is a turning away from sin and a turning to God in obedience
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:34.960]   and faith. And so the crowds asked him, "What then shall we do?" In verse 11, he answered them,
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:43.120]   and he got very specific with his application. And that's very instructive for us as biblical
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:54.400]   counselors in training. Note there the care and the specificity that characterize John's personal
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:35:00.560]   application of the doctrine of repentance. He didn't just say, "Well, repent and do what you
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:08.480]   want." He got personal. Verse 11, he answered them, "Whoever has two tunics is to share with him
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.480]   who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise."
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:18.400]   Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?"
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:26.880]   Notice John gave a different set of applications to the different types of people who were coming
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:37.840]   to him for ministry. Tax collector said, "Teacher, what shall we do?" And John said, "Collect no more
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:44.080]   than you are authorized to do." Verse 13, soldiers also asked him, "And we, what shall we do?" And
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:49.920]   he said to them, "Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation and be content
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:58.240]   with your wages." So again, just talking about counseling ministry, you and I are going to
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:04.560]   counsel different types of people. We're going to counsel older people and younger people. We're
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.600]   going to counsel people who are more mature in the faith and people who are brand new believers.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:15.600]   We're going to counsel people who are married and people who are single. We're going to counsel
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:22.560]   people from different ages and stages of life. And we need to learn to take this doctrine of
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:29.920]   repentance and make personal application that is different depending on the person whom we are
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.880]   ministering to. We need to learn not only to interpret the scriptures, but interpret
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:41.680]   the person who is in front of us. And that is a review of the year one training.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:48.960]   The applications for each believer will be different, even though the heart of repentance
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:55.760]   will be the same. The heart of each believer must be brought in humility before the Lord,
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:03.520]   but the expression of that humility will look different depending on the person
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:13.680]   and depending on their unique circumstances in life. My friend Matt Shackelford is an ACBC fellow
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:21.040]   and he helped me with this just in conversation about counseling. And he said, "When your
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:30.400]   counseling is stuck, get more specific in application. When your counseling is stuck
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:38.480]   and you feel like you're not getting anywhere, then get more specific in your personal application."
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.840]   And that's in line with the ministry of John the Baptist who made very personal application
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:50.720]   of the doctrine of repentance, but had that application differ depending on the person
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:59.120]   in front of him. Acts 26 verse 18, Jesus said to Paul, "I am sending you to open their eyes."
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:06.320]   And I love this. What a beautiful picture and description of repentance. "I'm sending you to
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:12.240]   open their eyes so that they may turn." Note that key word there and circle that.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:17.760]   "They may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God,
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   that they may receive forgiveness of sins in a place among those who are sanctified by faith
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:31.200]   in me." So the idea of repentance is one of a turning.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:40.720]   The sinner turns from wonderful truth, turns from darkness to light,
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:46.960]   turns from Satan to God, turns from sin to obedience to God's word,
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:57.760]   turns from self-reliance to a reliance on Christ. And I love how Jesus said to Paul,
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:05.360]   "I'm sending you to open their eyes." Their eyes must be open to see the truth if this
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:10.240]   turning in their lives is to take place. Now, that's just really practical,
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:16.880]   dear brothers and sisters in Christ. Friends, this is real practical. I pray this every time
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:22.960]   that I teach and I preach God's word. I pray this every time that I counsel or every time I have an
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:31.520]   evangelistic opportunity. "Lord, open the eyes of my audience's heart so that they may turn from
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:37.360]   whatever they're trusting in or clinging to in their lives and that they may turn to Christ."
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:42.320]   And I pray that for not only unbelievers, but I pray that for believers as well because
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:49.280]   believers tend to, we know, believers tend to turn back to sin, turn back to self,
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:54.960]   and we need to be continually reminded of the turning that needs to take place
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:06.400]   on a daily basis to turn away from sin and turn to Christ. And the eyes of our heart need to be
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:14.800]   open in that way. We cover 2 Timothy 2, verse 24. I won't belabor that point, but just note in Luke,
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:22.240]   the next passage there, Luke 15, verse 7, the joy of repentance, the joy of this ministry,
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.760]   which I've been trying to communicate to you, Luke 15, verse 7, "Just so I tell you,
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:36.480]   there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous persons who
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:44.400]   need no repentance." And you have that language of turning in 1 Thessalonians 1, verse 9,
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:50.400]   "For they themselves report concerning us the kind of perception we had among you and how you
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:58.800]   turned," there it is again, you can circle that word again, "you turned to God from idols to serve
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:06.080]   the living and the true God." So Grudem writes that "repentance like faith is an intellectual
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:11.680]   understanding that sin is wrong, an emotional approval of the teachings of scripture regarding
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:19.600]   sin, a sorrow for sin and the hatred of it, and a personal decision to turn from it, a renouncing of
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:27.680]   sin and a decision of the will to forsake it and lead a life of obedience to Christ itself. All of
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:39.120]   this is the work of God in the sinner's heart." So let me open this can of worms here and see if I
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:46.480]   can address this question. So the question would be, what is the relationship between faith and
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:53.440]   repentance? You'll notice in your Bibles that sometimes the Bible says, "repent and believe."
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:42:00.080]   Sometimes the Bible simply says, "repent." Sometimes the Bible says, "repent to believe
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:08.880]   in the Lord Jesus Christ." Are these two different calls to salvation? Are there two different
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:16.160]   requirements for salvation? And I don't believe that is true. I don't believe that when the
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:23.200]   Bible says, "repent and believe," that it's talking about two separate requirements of salvation. I
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:32.640]   believe that the language of "repent and believe" is talking about two aspects of the one call
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:42.800]   to salvation, two sides of one coin, if you will, "repent and believe." If a person is going to
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:51.600]   believe in Christ, they must turn from their sin. There must be a turning from self, a turning from
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:43:02.800]   idols. If a person repents, they must turn to something. One must not only turn away from sin,
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:08.000]   but turn to Christ. So I don't believe "repent and believe" are talking about two separate
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:16.640]   calls to salvation. I believe that it's talking about two sides of the same coin. And that's why
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:21.440]   the Scriptures sometimes say, "repent and believe." Sometimes the Scripture says,
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:31.040]   "believe," which implies repentance. And sometimes the Scripture says, "repent," which implies
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:41.920]   believe as you turn from your sin, turn to Christ in faith. And so as John Calvin has well said,
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:48.560]   "Now it ought to be a fact beyond controversy that repentance not only constantly follows faith,
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:58.560]   but is also born of faith." J.C. Ryle has said this on the next page of your handout,
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:06.560]   "Wherever faith is, there is repentance. Wherever repentance is, there's always faith."
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:14.000]   I do not decide which comes first, whether repentance comes before faith or faith before
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:21.200]   repentance. But I am bold to say that the two graces are never found separate one from the
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:28.800]   other. Just as you cannot have the sun without light or ice without cold or fire without heat
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:36.080]   or water without moisture, you will never find true faith without true repentance. And you will
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:43.120]   never find true repentance without lively faith. The two things will always go side by side.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:52.880]   I think he says it as well as it can be said. Repentance and faith are two sides of the same
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:58.880]   coin. So on your handout there, you see there that sometimes both repentance and faith are mentioned.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:07.600]   Sometimes only faith is mentioned. Sometimes only repentance is mentioned. Repentance and
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:16.720]   faith are two sides of the same coin. Repentant faith is what is necessary for salvation.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:26.000]   And so we work through these things and think through that in your own understanding.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:37.360]   So before I get to this next slide here, let me look to some of the rest of the handout on this
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:46.000]   page. You see there the tension that repentance is a gift of God. As we mentioned, God grants
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:53.360]   repentance. And at the same time, it is the responsibility of man. So we have to live in
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:46:02.080]   that tension. We call people to repentance while understanding that God is the one who grants
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:07.600]   repentance. So by the way, we do need to get comfortable in counseling ministry
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:16.320]   in calling our counselees to repentance. Now, please be balanced with this.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:24.320]   I don't recommend, at least with the counselors in our center, I don't recommend that they do
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:31.200]   the full John the Baptist and start calling their counselees brood of vipers. And on the first
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:39.040]   session, start warning them of the one who comes and who will baptize them with fire.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:45.760]   There might be a counselee who needs that type of direct treatment, but I don't usually recommend
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:54.960]   that type of direct ministry unless you are sensing a really stubborn heart.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:02.320]   You don't want every word out of your mouth to be repent, repent, repent.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:07.120]   I've had this discussion with those who are training for counseling ministry,
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:12.400]   and some have said even, "Well, what about the prophet Nathan who came to David and said,
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:18.800]   'You're the man. You have sinned. You're the man.' Isn't there a place for that in counseling
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:25.440]   ministry?" Just to say, "You've sinned and you need to repent." And my response is, "Well,
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   make sure you read the rest of that passage. How did Nathan approach
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:38.480]   David and confront him on his sin?" It wasn't just, "You're the man and you're in sin." Didn't
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:48.480]   Nathan actually tell a story? Didn't he give an illustration of a sheep and tell this vivid story
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:53.360]   that would illustrate David's sin? And it was only after David really didn't get the point of that
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:59.680]   story that he was the one being addressed. That was when Nathan got very pointed with him and said,
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:09.440]   "You're the man." There's a place for dialogue and there's a place for illustrations. We cover some
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:15.760]   of this in year one of our training. There's a place to ask questions. Like God asked Jonah
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:25.760]   in Jonah 4 verse 1, "Jonah, do you do well to be angry?" There's a place to ask questions that
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:34.480]   would lead a counselee to reflect on their own behavior. And you probably would be much wiser to
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:42.080]   lead a counselee to see his or her own sin than to be constantly be the counselor who says,
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:49.120]   "That's a sin. Repent. That's a sin. Repent." Just reflect on that. I'm not saying there's
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:54.480]   not a place for that. I'm just saying that I surely would not want to see a counselor who
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:03.280]   in every session just simply said, "You're in sin. Repent." But with that said, there is a place for
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:09.920]   calling the counselee to repentance with gentleness, with kindness,
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:17.920]   using the various means, illustrations, questions, leading a dialogue. But we are here to
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:23.440]   change minds. We are praying that God would change hearts. We're not just merely engaging
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:29.360]   in a vent session where the person vents their emotions time after time in a counseling session.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:37.440]   We are looking for heart change. And so we do want to use this doctrine in counseling ministry.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:49.360]   We want our counselees to repent of sin. Now, I want to reflect on this whole idea in the time I
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:58.320]   have remaining here of repentance continuing through the Christian life. So I hope you're
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:05.840]   convinced that a person cannot become a Christian without repenting of sin and believing in Christ,
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:11.920]   repent and believe are the two sides of one coin. I hope you're convinced of that,
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:18.640]   that a person can become a Christian and then live in continual unrepentant sin.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:26.160]   Part of the repentance is just the metanoia, the changing of heart and mind that sees Christ
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:34.560]   as so much better than sin so that the true believer still struggles with sin,
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:42.880]   but the true believer does not love sin in the way that he or she loved sin as an unbeliever.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:50.960]   There's that work that God does in a person's heart where you see that Christ is so much better
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:57.280]   than the fleeting pleasures of sin. Christ is so much better than the deceitfulness of sin
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:03.280]   and that you simply cannot continue in sin and embrace Christ at the same time.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:10.720]   And so a person begins a Christian life through repenting of sin and believing in Christ,
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:16.800]   but just a reflection here that repentance does continue through the Christian life,
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:26.560]   and I think this is illustrated in Ephesians 4 verses 22 to 24 where Paul addresses Christians.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:36.400]   And he says in verse 22, "To put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:42.640]   and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:49.440]   and to put on the new self created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:52:01.760]   holiness." Now, watch this. We're going to see the same dynamic at work here that we saw in
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:07.120]   the ministry of John the Baptist. Notice that John the Baptist, he gave this general call to
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:13.120]   repentance. He said, "Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand." Then when they came to him and
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:20.000]   they said, "What shall we do?" He got very specific in his application of repentance to their lives.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:30.720]   Paul is going to follow a similar pattern. He's going to introduce this general concept of putting
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:35.520]   off the old self and renewing your minds in the truth and then putting on the new self,
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:42.240]   the put off, put on dynamic that ought to characterize our lives. And then we might
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:48.800]   be asking, "Well, what then shall we do? How are we to put off sin and put on righteousness?"
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.640]   Paul, at that point, gets very specific in his application.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:53:02.240]   He says in verse 25, "Put off falsehood and put on speaking truth.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:08.320]   Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:19.040]   with his neighbors, for we are members one of another." By the way, we talked about this
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:28.400]   in year one in marital communication. That verse means you put off using exaggerated speech
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:38.000]   because it's not true. The language of, "You never listen to me," or, "You always disrespect me,"
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:46.400]   or, "We don't have anything in common." Those are exaggerations that as an expression of repentance,
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:52.160]   you put off that type of speech and you put on speaking truth.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:54:02.320]   Verse 26, "You put off sinful anger and you put on righteous anger." Paul says, "Be angry and do
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:08.480]   not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your anger and give no opportunity to the devil."
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:16.640]   Paul's meaning here is that the believer puts off sinful anger. Be angry and do not sin.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:25.440]   Yet, this verse does allow for a form of righteous anger, the type of anger that does not sin.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:32.880]   There is an aspect of righteous anger to our lives, although we must be very careful with that
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:40.960]   category of anger. We ought to be angry at false doctrine and we ought to be angry when Christ's
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:49.520]   name is dishonored. We ought to be angry righteously at certain sins such as abortion
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:58.000]   or genocide. We ought to be angry at certain things that we see in our society. A righteous
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:05.040]   anger that is self-controlled and that has more to do with the glory of God than personal offense.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:13.920]   Paul says, "Put off sinful anger. Put on righteous anger." He says in verse 28, "Put off stealing and
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:19.920]   put on sharing. Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor doing honest work with
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:26.880]   his own hands that he may have something to share with anyone in need." He says, "Put off corrupting
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:33.360]   speech. Put on edifying speech. Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:38.880]   good for building up as fits the occasion that it may give grace to those who hear."
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:49.120]   Then he says, "Put off bitterness and put on forgiveness. Let all bitterness and wrath and
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:54.400]   anger and clamor and slander be put away from you along with all malice. Be kind to one another,
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:56:01.360]   tender-hearted, forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave you." Now,
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:10.560]   just look at that list of applications for a moment and just look at this as an illustration
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:17.600]   of the dynamic of repentance that ought to be characterizing our lives. Would you agree if you
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:25.280]   looked at that passage and you look at the applications of the put off and put on dynamic,
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:31.120]   putting off falsehood, putting on truth, putting off anger, putting on righteous anger,
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:38.800]   putting off stealing, putting on sharing, putting off all corrupting speech, putting on only speech
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:45.200]   that builds up and edifies, putting off all these forms of bitterness, wrath, clamor, slander,
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:52.800]   malice, and putting on forgiveness of other sins? Would you agree with Martin Luther's statement
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:57:05.520]   that all of life is repentance? Is there anyone among us who can look at that passage and all
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:13.120]   the applications of the truth of repentance and say, "Well, I've kind of reached a point where I
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:18.800]   don't need to do this anymore. I don't need to put off and put on anymore. I've sort of been a
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:26.320]   Christian for 15 years now, and at year 15, I've kind of arrived where I don't need to put off and
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:35.120]   put on anymore. I'm living perfectly on the right side of that column, and I have no need of daily
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:40.240]   repentance." I'd be saying, "Are you kidding me? You just haven't studied the passage."
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:48.880]   All of us would look at those applications and see that we all have need of daily repentance,
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:55.360]   and if you need an illustration of that, just look at that last application. All bitterness,
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:58:05.280]   all wrath, all clamor, all slander, all malice. Paul says, and here's the language of repentance,
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:12.640]   the language of repentance, they must be put away, which refers to a decisive, definitive
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:22.320]   action that needs to be carried out with a sense of urgency. A person says, "I'm angry." Paul
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:29.360]   doesn't say, "Well, find a place to vent or find a place to let off steam." He says, "Let that anger
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:39.200]   be put away from you. You have a responsibility to repent of that sinful anger and to forgive
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:48.880]   as Christ has forgiven you, which means that you must forgive from the heart."
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:59:02.720]   All of the Christian life is repentance. Repentance continues in each of us, each of our lives,
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:09.840]   and where a counselor is helpful, and by the way, you can make a whole counseling ministry if you
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:17.600]   just master Ephesians 4. Actually, David Powelson said that if you just master the book of Ephesians,
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:23.120]   you can have an entire lifetime of counseling just based upon using the book of Ephesians,
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:29.680]   and he actually wrote a book. I think the book is Speaking the Truth in Love. He actually
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:35.680]   wrote a book that illustrates how you just use Ephesians in counseling, and you can address
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:42.400]   so many counseling issues just by mastering that one book, but even if you just mastered Ephesians
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:49.680]   chapter 4, and even just this passage, Ephesians 4 verses 22 to 32, how much counseling could you
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:55.600]   do? I mean, anyone dealing with any of these issues could be helped as you take them to the
[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:01.920]   truth of God's Word, and then where a counselor is helpful is you get very specific based upon the
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:09.440]   counselee who is in front of you. You don't just say, "Well, forgive as Christ has forgiven you."
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:18.880]   In counseling, you say, "Bob, God's Word is calling you to forgive Bill."
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:26.720]   For the times where, Bill, your co-worker came and was really critical toward you in his speech,
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:36.240]   God is calling you to forgive him as Christ has forgiven you, and you call
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:41.440]   Bob or whoever you counsel, you call that person to repentance.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:48.400]   Just as I close, I would just note that there is joy in
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:59.840]   walking on the path of obedience. There is joy in walking in newness of life. Let me ask you
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:10.880]   to consider who is happier, the Christian who is living in bondage to bitterness and anger and wrath
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:18.240]   and just stewing over the things that have been done wrong to him or her, or the person who has
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:26.080]   repented of those sins and is walking with Christ, a person who has pleaded with God to change and
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.840]   soften his or her heart, and who has become tenderhearted, forgiving others. This is why
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:38.720]   C. H. Spurgeon said, "The true evangelical repentance is food to the saintly soul.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:44.640]   I do not know, beloved, when I am more perfectly happy than when I am weeping for sin at the foot
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:52.400]   of the cross, for that is the safest place in which I can stand. Sorrow for sin is a sweet sorrow.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:59.280]   Do not desire to escape it." I think Roland Hill was right when he said that his only regret in
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:09.520]   going to heaven would be that he could no more repent. And so I commend to you the study of this
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:19.680]   topic. There's some more work there that I won't cover from 2 Corinthians 7 on distinguishing
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:27.440]   worldly sorrow from true repentance. Do some work on that. Read Brad Bigney's handout on that
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:34.800]   subject. And if you need more help on that, Heath Lambert's book, Finally Free, Chapter 2,
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:42.960]   has an excellent chapter on distinguishing worldly sorrow from godly repentance. And I would commend
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:52.560]   that chapter to you if you want more work on that subject. But I hope and pray that we will all live
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:03:02.160]   in the good of this doctrine. And by the way, when you do see your counselee repent, just affirm that.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:11.600]   Just learn to tell your counselee that the fact that you are seeing your sin,
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:17.520]   the fact that you are seeing your need for change is the evidence of God's work in you.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:24.480]   I believe that what I'm seeing in your life is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:30.480]   I believe that you're a true Christian because you're seeking to repent of sin. Just learn to
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:37.520]   affirm. Affirm God's forgiveness. Learn to use 1 John 1, 9 that if we confess our sins,
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:43.840]   then he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and our transgressions. And just affirm
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:49.280]   that in your counselee's life that I believe that on the authority of God's word that God has
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:55.680]   forgiven you of the sin because you are, God will not despise a broken and contrite heart.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:02.720]   Just learn to, when you do see that in the people you work with, to affirm those things and to
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:08.960]   encourage your counselee in that way. But I do pray that we will live in the good of Psalm 32,
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:16.640]   verse 1, "Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:25.440]   man against whom the Lord counts no iniquity and in whose spirit there is no deceit." Thank you so
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:34.480]   much for being with us tonight on this webinar. And just I pray for each of you that God will
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:41.680]   bless your studies. If I can be of any help or if Jacqueline can be of any help in your studies,
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:49.280]   please feel free to email us at counseling@kinderchurch.org. I do look forward to
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:56.240]   showing you the new counseling offices and just rejoicing in what God is doing in there. And we
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:05.120]   need those offices to be filled. And so we are praying that God will bless each of your training
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:12.000]   and that He will equip you for this wonderful ministry. And we're so excited about what the
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.840]   Lord is doing. So let me pray for us and close our time together. And we will regather next
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:24.400]   Sunday at 5 o'clock and continue with theology exam number 18. Let me pray for us. Father,
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:33.680]   thank you for our time together. We do thank you for the doctrine of repentance. And we pray that
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:41.440]   we may learn to daily repent of our own sin, to turn from sin, and to embrace Christ by faith.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:49.600]   Help us to put off the old man, to renew our minds with the truth of your Word,
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:56.640]   and to put on the new man, and to make application of these things to our own lives so that it is out
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:03.840]   of the experience of a transformed heart and life that we would lead others to experience
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:10.480]   that same transformation. Lord, do it work in our own hearts. Repentance is not easy.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:19.040]   We pray that you would help us to repent, not only on the surface level of behavior and words
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:27.280]   and actions, but at the heart level, at the level of our thinking, our desires, our values,
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:33.760]   our treasures, what we worship and build our lives around, that we will learn to
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:42.960]   to turn from idolatry and from the things that we worship, and that we would turn to
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:50.880]   embrace Christ and worship Christ in him alone. We thank you for the purifying work of your Word,
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:56.720]   the work that you're doing in each of our lives. Pray that you would keep us and bless us
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.200]   in this next week and regather.
