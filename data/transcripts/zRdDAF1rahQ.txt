[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.500]   - Good Monday morning, everyone.
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.280]   We open this new week on the podcast addressing
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.240]   one of the many questions we have not addressed directly.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.440]   Embryo adoption.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.400]   There are several versions of this question.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.000]   I'll put them all on the table, Pastor John, for you.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.080]   A listener named Sveta writes in,
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.960]   hello, Pastor John, I have a follow-up question
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.200]   to ABJ1165, what do you think about
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.760]   so-called snowflake adoptions,
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.400]   in which a frozen embryo left over
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.960]   from another family's IVF process is implanted
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.280]   into a woman to give this child a chance at life?
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.640]   Laura, a listener, wants to know if there's
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.080]   a moral difference between adopting the orphaned-born
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.500]   versus adopting the orphaned-unborn.
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.880]   Likewise, Audrey asks, should embryo adoption
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.500]   be considered something that Christians value
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.400]   as much as after-birth adoptions?
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.760]   In fact, several listeners have asked,
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.960]   in essence, are frozen embryos as much orphans
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.320]   to concern the church with as living, breathing orphans?
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.320]   And this is a very real question for one couple.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.300]   Hello, Pastor John, my name is Kareem from Australia.
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.040]   I recently read some articles about considering
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.900]   embryo adoption to help those babies
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.900]   live their God-given life with a loving family.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.600]   My husband and I are considering this option.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.920]   We lost our only child in 2019,
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.420]   and we feel ready to love a child again.
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.840]   But my husband is sub-fertile,
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.680]   and the normal adoption process
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.080]   in Australia is long and expensive.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.440]   But my question is, how could I be sure
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.680]   that adopting an embryo is what God intended for us?
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.820]   We want a child, but does embryo adoption
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.080]   allow us to play God and choose parenthood?
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.600]   Maybe God made my husband sub-fertile for a reason.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.560]   I guess I just wanna make sure that this is God's will
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.980]   and not our own will here.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.460]   Also, another concerning fact about embryo adoption
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.080]   is that the clinic transfers all of the donor's embryos
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.360]   into the recipient.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.240]   What if the donor has three frozen embryos,
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.200]   and we can only afford to grow one baby?
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.280]   Then it does not help the other two frozen babies left,
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.360]   as one will have to decide to keep them frozen
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.340]   or to destroy them.
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.320]   Maybe we are overthinking this process,
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.320]   but we want to do what is right in God's eyes.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.800]   - There are so many angles
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.160]   from which we could come at this question.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.160]   I hope the angle that I take will prove helpful in the end,
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.120]   even though it's somewhat indirect
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.400]   concerning the question of God's will
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.320]   for this couple's life.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.600]   I assume what they are asking
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.600]   is not that I tell them whether to adopt a frozen child,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.840]   but whether there is anything in God's word,
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.120]   God's revealed will,
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.220]   that would make such an adoption sinful.
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.040]   Now, the angle I want to take
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.840]   is to make the observation
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.400]   that when we have a tragic situation,
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.600]   we who are Christians should feel a desire
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   to take action to mitigate the tragedy in two ways.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.080]   One way is that we should be thinking about
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.080]   how to get at the causes of the tragedy upstream,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.000]   so to speak, from the actual tragedy
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.760]   and do what we can to hinder the tragedy
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.720]   from becoming worse by dealing with those causes.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.320]   The other way we should be thinking
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.800]   is how to mitigate the tragedy,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.660]   not just by looking upstream to its causes,
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.100]   but looking at the tragedy as it is right now
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.200]   and downstream to its effects,
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.040]   and we should be moved to take action
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.440]   so as to make the present situation
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.000]   and the future situation less destructive
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.320]   and heartbreaking than it is.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.720]   Now, I think the existence of 750,000 frozen children
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:12.540]   in America and 120,000 in Australia is a tragedy.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.320]   God's revealed will in his word
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.620]   for the conception and pregnancy
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.660]   and birth and rearing of children
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.720]   is not that it be done in such a way
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.780]   that results in hundreds of thousands
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.500]   of eventually abandoned children.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.740]   This means that upstream from the tragedy,
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.560]   mingled into whatever sorrowful situations
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.720]   may motivate the in vitro fertilization
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.680]   that results in so many, quote,
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.760]   "extra conceived children outside the womb,"
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   there are sinful desires and practices.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.960]   They're mingled in.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.460]   Nobody forced this tragedy on anyone.
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.800]   It's not like the result of a hurricane
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.180]   or a pandemic that leaves orphans.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.180]   These hundreds of thousands of orphans
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.200]   are not owing to the death of their parents.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.040]   Choices are being made that result
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.860]   in this heartbreaking reality
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.020]   of hundreds of thousands of unwanted children.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.780]   Some Christians should devote energy
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.100]   to looking upstream and trying to reverse
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.000]   the causes of this tragedy.
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.860]   For example, Germany has a law
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.420]   that says only three embryos can be created
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.900]   in one in vitro fertilization cycle,
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.320]   and they must all be transferred into the mother's womb.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.460]   This in effect prevents the tragic situation
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.320]   of thousands of frozen children accumulating
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.820]   and eventually being unwanted.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.700]   Some Christians should be looking upstream
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.780]   to work for those kinds of preventions.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.620]   I think Jennifer Lall,
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.540]   the president of the Center for Bioethics
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.060]   and Culture Network, is a person like that.
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.540]   She relentlessly tries to draw our attention
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.680]   to the moral problems that multiply
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.220]   when we take the processes of conception
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.660]   and pregnancy into our own hands outside the womb.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.700]   For all the joy that may come for some couples,
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.820]   we need to be aware of the legal tangles
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.900]   and the personal tragedies that also result.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.020]   So I think one of the first things
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.020]   that Corrine and her husband need to come to terms with
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.700]   is that they are dealing with a tragic situation
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.700]   with some innocent and some sinful causes.
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.920]   It's not a neutral situation.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.220]   If they move forward with adoption
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.860]   of one of these frozen children,
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.800]   and frankly, I hope they do,
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.420]   I think it will spare them future pangs of conscience
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.620]   if they do it with eyes wide open.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.620]   Someone will accuse them of participating in a system
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.340]   that is shot through with processes and procedures
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.340]   and priorities that are unwise and sometimes sinful.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.020]   Others will point out that children created in this way
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.940]   will face many difficult and troubling realities
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.660]   as they come to know and understand
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.720]   their conception stories.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.780]   I think Corrine and her husband need to be ready
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.420]   just for their own conscience
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.420]   to respond to such concerns with wisdom and patience.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.020]   That's why I introduced the second way
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.940]   of approaching a tragedy like this.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.220]   Not just looking upstream for ways to prevent it,
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.580]   but looking at it for what it is
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.980]   and asking how we might mitigate,
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.460]   at least in a small way, the tragedy right in front of us.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:34.260]   And one strategy of taking that approach
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.500]   is the strategy of adoption.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.740]   I know two couples who have embraced this way of life
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.220]   and I admire them for it.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.980]   They are not naive and they are moved
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.840]   both by their principled opposition
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.720]   to the destruction of these frozen children
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.220]   and by their loving longing
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.460]   to have some of these children in their own family.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.580]   I wrote a little book one time called "Risk is Right."
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.300]   I didn't mean that anybody should jump off a cliff
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.580]   thinking an angel would catch them,
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.580]   but I did mean that for the sake of love
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.660]   and for the glory of God and for the peace of conscience,
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.260]   it is right to look all of the possible future heartache
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.300]   and pain in the face that may come with such an adoption
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.740]   and then to act like Esther did.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.300]   For the sake of saving her Jewish kinsmen,
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.980]   she approached the king, which was illegal,
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.420]   and the only way she would survive this disobedience
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.660]   is if he graciously lifted his scepter.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.260]   She asked her family and her friends to fast
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.940]   and pray for her, which is what we should do
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.280]   when we adopt children.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:04.420]   And then she said, "If I perish, I perish."
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:09.620]   That's the kind of risk I think glorifies God.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.180]   She wasn't trying to make a name for herself.
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.180]   She wasn't trying to be a hero.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.900]   She was trying to save people who were gonna perish
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.640]   if she couldn't change the king's mind.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.800]   And so it is with thousands of these frozen children.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.280]   They're going to be disposed of sooner or later
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.740]   if they're not adopted.
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.220]   It is a wonderful thing to be a Christian
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:43.080]   and to know that Christ died for our sins
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.380]   so that even if we are not completely sure
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:52.380]   about all our motives and all our tactical efforts
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.720]   to be loving, even if we're not sure
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.260]   that we have all the wisdom we need,
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.640]   we can be sure of this.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.260]   The record of our debts is nailed to the cross.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.620]   With that assurance, we embrace the ambiguities
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.300]   of this fallen, tragic world,
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.960]   and we do our best to act in love.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.700]   I do not doubt that God will guide Corrine
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.820]   and her husband in the path of love
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:31.820]   and meet every need that they have for the next 50 years,
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.200]   according to his riches in glory
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.680]   and according to his promise.
