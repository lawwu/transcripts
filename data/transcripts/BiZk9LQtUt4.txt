[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.900]   - All right, folks, welcome to our second breakout session
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.560]   for retirees and pre-retirees.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.020]   My name is John Luskin.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.180]   Joining me today is Dana Anspach,
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.180]   and I'm gonna read her a little bio.
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.940]   Dana is the founder and CEO of Sensible Money,
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.020]   a firm specializing in retirement income planning.
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.620]   She's the author of "How to Plan
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.460]   "for the Perfect Retirement," a lecture series,
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.220]   and "Control Your Retirement Destiny," available on Amazon.
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.740]   So, folks, I'm gonna start with a Q&A
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.640]   that I got from the Bogleheads community online
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.020]   before the conference.
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.820]   And then if you have a question for Dana,
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.660]   then Christine Benz up front,
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.220]   she is gonna be collecting your questions.
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.180]   So give your questions to Christine,
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.260]   and then she'll hand them to me,
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.920]   and then we'll answer your questions.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.160]   So let's get started from those questions
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.060]   we got from the Bogleheads community.
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.780]   And the first one is from Greg Wilson
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.240]   from Bogleheads Twitter, who writes,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.200]   "Ask her to name her three most common
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.500]   "tax mitigation recommendations."
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.980]   - Ooh, tax mitigation strategies.
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.700]   Well, I would have to ask Greg,
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.460]   does he mean long-term tax mitigation or short-term?
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.900]   I will kind of assume he means long-term.
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.220]   So when we're talking about retirement income planning,
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.180]   we're typically looking at how do we reduce
[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.060]   the tax liability over the course of your life,
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.960]   which is very different than how do I reduce
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.100]   the tax liability next year?
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.740]   And so I would have to put at the top of the list
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.980]   would be Roth conversion strategies.
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.420]   Absolutely, when done correctly
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.900]   and filling up to a marginal bracket
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.240]   using some of the types of analysis that Wade showed,
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.980]   you can reduce someone's lifetime tax liability.
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.380]   Now included in that lifetime tax liability,
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.740]   we might also count IRMA premiums.
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.820]   And so when you're reducing the RMDs later in life,
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.600]   you can have a meaningful impact
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.320]   on someone's long-term tax liability.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.740]   Probably number two would be simply
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.340]   managing gains and losses.
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.380]   And so we have seen people in their first few years
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.460]   of retirement who would be able to realize capital gains
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.460]   in the 0% bracket with proper planning.
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.820]   And so that can be pretty meaningful.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.740]   And I might put number three would be qualifying people
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.660]   for the healthcare tax credits.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.860]   And so if we have someone retiring earlier than 65,
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.860]   we've had people with close to $3 million portfolios
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.980]   that for several years, all the way up until they turn 65,
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.700]   were able to qualify them for those tax credits
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.100]   just by where and how they take their cash flow from.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.860]   So they're not living on nothing,
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.500]   but the way you're structuring the portfolio
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.820]   and the cash flow, you're able to keep their AGI low enough
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.940]   that they're qualifying for those tax credits.
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.780]   And in one case, that added $30,000 a year.
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.020]   So it was $30,000 a year of tax credit subsidies.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.740]   So that would probably be, when I think of long-term,
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.260]   probably the top three.
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.180]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.660]   Let me ask a follow-up question about that.
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.740]   With respect to the Roth conversion planning,
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.060]   does it always make sense to do a Roth conversion?
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.460]   How do you know a Roth conversion
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.420]   is gonna be the right strategy for a retiree or pre-retiree?
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.220]   - Well, with a lot of analysis. (laughs)
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.100]   So we use projection software that maps out
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.180]   someone's tax rate now, someone's tax rate later.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.460]   And when I say tax rate, it's not just the marginal tax rate.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.540]   It's including all of the things that Wade talks about
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.460]   in terms of how much of your Social Security is taxed
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.820]   and you'll be subject to an IRMA premium.
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.340]   And if we do this, will it push you into a higher
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.220]   capital gains tax racket?
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.420]   So all of that is factored into that long-term tax analysis.
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.700]   So it's not as simple as saying what's my marginal rate now
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.780]   and what will my marginal rate be later?
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.380]   Because it gets more complicated in retirement
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.860]   with all of the different formulas
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.020]   that are tied to some form of modified adjusted gross income.
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.180]   And so we map it all out now through your lifetime
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.580]   and then do a form of testing that says,
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.420]   well, if I did this series of Roth conversions,
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.020]   does that make your plan look better, more funded?
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.580]   So we use the same kind of fundedness analysis
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.660]   that Wade was talking about.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.180]   And we can quantify everything into that number.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.500]   Did this decision add fundedness?
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.260]   Did it increase your fundedness?
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260]   Or did it decrease your fundedness?
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.020]   And so it's not easy to determine it
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.300]   if you wanna do it in a mathematical way.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.620]   - Certainly, and you touched on with respect to,
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.060]   because it can be so complicated
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.180]   because of the IRMA breakpoints, et cetera.
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.380]   Folks certainly don't wanna be doing this on a spreadsheet.
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.980]   To paraphrase Mike Piper,
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.260]   he talked about this at last year's conference.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.860]   There's a great video up that you can find
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.580]   on the Bogle Center that he goes over
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.580]   how to do Roth conversion planning for do-it-yourselfers.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.180]   And he says, hey, you wanna use some sort of software,
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.200]   don't do it on a spreadsheet
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.500]   because the tax code just is that complicated.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.520]   Let's jump to our next question.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.900]   This one is from Ryan Richardson from Bogleheads Facebook
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.700]   who asks about the age in bonds rule.
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.880]   So probably this doesn't need much explanation,
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.300]   but the age in bonds rule is,
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.740]   hey, if you're six years old,
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.620]   then you wanna have 60% of your portfolio in bonds,
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.580]   the rest in stocks.
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.980]   What's your take on that age in bonds rule?
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.680]   - Well, I've never been a fan of that age in bonds rule.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.500]   I think a much more customized approach
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.920]   is more appropriate.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.840]   So the amount of cash flow that we might need
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.700]   from our portfolio isn't really dependent on our age.
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.080]   There's all kinds of other circumstances
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.620]   that can come into play.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.260]   You might have plenty of cash flow
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.340]   to cover all your needs despite your age.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.220]   And so I'm a fan, as you know,
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.060]   if you've been listening to my presentation yesterday
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.020]   of implementing bond ladders,
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.620]   of actually using what is called
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.820]   an asset liability matching approach
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.600]   where you're determining the amount of fixed income
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.460]   by the years of cash flow that you want covered.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.400]   And so that's a very personalized analysis.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.460]   If you study some of Michael Kitsy's work
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.020]   and Wade was referring to a paper that he and Kitsy's did
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.500]   where they talk about your glide path in retirement,
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.020]   there is some thought of creating
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.820]   something called a bond tent
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.020]   where you would have a higher allocation to fixed income
[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.900]   to cover what are called the retirement red zone years,
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.660]   that five years leading up to
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.380]   and perhaps first five to 10 years of retirement
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.060]   where you can be at the greatest risk of sequence risk.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.100]   And so you could have a much higher allocation
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.180]   to fixed income as you're approaching that retirement date
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.460]   and then actually let that fixed income allocation
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.860]   decline a bit, which would be the opposite
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.200]   of the age and bonds rule.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.140]   So of course, you all have to make that decision
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.260]   for yourself, but I don't like the just automated rules.
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.740]   I think looking at it in relation to your actual situation
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.180]   makes the most sense.
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.660]   - Yeah, no, certainly I agree with you.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.300]   As you move into retirement,
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.220]   yes, you wanna be taking less risk,
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.060]   but then that first day of retirement at that point,
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.980]   maybe it doesn't make sense to decrease risk at that point.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.540]   It might not be completely unreasonable
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.700]   to increase the amount of risk that you're taking.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.860]   So let's say the age and bonds rule is good up to a point,
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.380]   the first day of retirement after that,
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.460]   it might not be as useful.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.820]   We've got one more question from the Bogleheads community
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.780]   that I got beforehand.
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.940]   If you've got your question,
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.480]   make sure to give it to Christine Benz.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.380]   She's up front here.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.280]   She's gonna be our question moderator.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.180]   All right, so our final question that we got beforehand
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.260]   from the Bogleheads community,
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.180]   this one is from Patty Fairchild from Bogleheads Facebook,
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.220]   who asks about alternative assets,
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.460]   such as private equity and private credit.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.380]   What role do they have in a retirement portfolio?
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.820]   - Well, I could give the very simple answer
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.300]   that William Bernstein gave earlier and just say none,
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.480]   but that wouldn't really be the answer.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.740]   I've been practicing as a financial planner since 1995,
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.520]   and I've had clients come in
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.500]   that did all kinds of private equity,
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.140]   private credit investments,
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.580]   and that's a pretty broad category in itself.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.640]   Oftentimes it's, you know, a friend is starting this,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.300]   or I've heard about this private offering,
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.660]   and without exception,
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.740]   I have seen every single one lose money.
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.780]   Every one.
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.220]   Now, the one exception was a company called iMortgage
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.740]   that the client invested 25,000,
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.740]   and I think it turned into about half a million
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.020]   over a 12-year period.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.260]   So it was, you know, by far a winner.
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.340]   But when you're looking at private equity,
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.700]   private credit investments, you know,
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.340]   as we say, there's no free lunch,
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.780]   except apparently for the Vanguard
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.060]   Total Market Index return fund,
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.340]   where maybe there is some free lunch right now.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.140]   But typically, higher returns mean higher risk.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.540]   And so you have to decide, like, is it worth it?
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.540]   You know, what's the potential value
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.980]   that adding this asset class
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.740]   is really gonna do for your portfolio?
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.300]   They're often illiquid asset classes.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.100]   I don't like illiquidity in retirement.
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.060]   And are you really gonna get enough
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.620]   to have, you know, potential return
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.260]   to make that additional risk worth it?
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.860]   In most cases, I think the answer is no.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.100]   Where I could see it be appropriate
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.180]   is when you're talking about much higher net worth clients,
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.660]   you're talking about $20 million portfolios
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.500]   where they're really looking at adding diversification,
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.500]   then maybe adding some of those alternative asset classes
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.340]   starts to make sense.
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.740]   - So to be a bookhead, I'll say one thing
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.580]   that's really important that's missing from this question
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.660]   is what are the fees, right?
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.060]   We're asking about an investment,
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.420]   but we're totally ignoring the fees.
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.660]   And that's the problem with a lot of the private investments
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.860]   that are out there.
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.820]   Yes, maybe you're able to access a different asset class
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.220]   as sexy as it is,
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.620]   but you're ignoring the really important factor of cost.
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.180]   So once you factor in cost,
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.180]   maybe these products aren't gonna perform
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.020]   as you think they might.
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.540]   So Christine is going around now collecting your questions,
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.940]   and I will wait for her to come back
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.740]   'cause I can ask you another question in the meantime.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.860]   So let's, thank you.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.940]   So let's start with where often do you see money
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.100]   getting left on the table when it comes to retirees?
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.500]   - The biggest areas I've seen money left on the table
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.580]   would be people who don't do planning.
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.580]   And by money left on the table,
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.580]   a lot of people are gonna be fine following a rule of thumb,
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.340]   and they're not gonna run out of money.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.700]   But as Mike Piper was just talking about,
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.860]   that idea of giving more or you have enough,
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.660]   and so what do you really want to do?
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.540]   And we talked to our clients about this also
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.340]   in terms of what are the things
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.340]   that can really make a difference?
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.980]   And so it's not leaving money necessarily on the table,
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.180]   but quality of life on the table,
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.820]   or we have a client who, as most of you are, very frugal,
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.140]   and that's why they've been successful at saving.
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.420]   And so when we talked about spending more,
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.980]   I didn't mean much to them,
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.420]   but they have a family member
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.540]   who has always lived paycheck to paycheck
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.620]   and had some healthcare problems,
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.220]   and they thought, "Wow, if we can give this person $10,000,
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.200]   "what a difference it would make."
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.780]   And they did.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.600]   And this person at first was just like,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.660]   "Why are you doing this?"
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.400]   And they explained their rationality.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.500]   They had read the book "Die With Zero."
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.060]   And it just, you know, they were able to firsthand see
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.220]   what was the impact that they made on this person's life.
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.180]   And so that can be something that gets left on the table,
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.060]   that if you didn't do the proper planning
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.380]   and know that you could do this,
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.340]   you missed out on that experience.
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.260]   - We've got a follow-up question
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.500]   to what we were talking about earlier,
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.900]   which is that age and bonds rule.
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.100]   So related, is a Vanguard target date fund adequate
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.660]   for a retirement portfolio?
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.360]   When would it not be adequate?
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.980]   - Is it adequate?
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.460]   Yeah, you know, I think it would be.
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.420]   I think, who was it that talked about
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.100]   the reasonable retirement portfolios?
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.020]   Jim.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.100]   And so I haven't seen that,
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.300]   but it sounds like there's hundreds
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.140]   of reasonable retirement portfolios.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.380]   And I think a Vanguard target date fund
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.200]   could be one of many of those options
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.940]   in terms of reasonable retirement portfolios.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.060]   Could you have a different approach that, you know,
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.220]   it's all that might allow you to have different results
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.260]   or different outcomes?
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.080]   Yes.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.500]   But is it a reasonable approach?
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.660]   Absolutely.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.660]   To me, what's most important
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.620]   is whatever approach you're gonna use,
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.060]   is you stick with that approach.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.280]   And so where I see the most trouble happen
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.780]   is people start and then they jump ship
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.100]   and then they jump ship.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.740]   And oftentimes those times
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.420]   where they're making a big shift are,
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.460]   they may not think so,
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.420]   but they're because of market-driven events
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.940]   and perhaps emotionally they're fearful
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.620]   that they made the wrong decision.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.060]   And those changes end up hurting them a lot more
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.620]   than if they had just stuck with whatever strategy it was
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.740]   that they wanted to follow
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.980]   and used it in a very disciplined fashion
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.500]   throughout their retirement years.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.900]   When would a target date retirement fund
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:24.940]   not be appropriate?
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:30.460]   Well, (laughs)
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.260]   I can tell you, so as a financial advisor,
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.980]   I wouldn't use a retirement target date fund
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.980]   because I feel like people are paying us
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.260]   to do something that is more customized.
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.300]   It is more complex.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.540]   And so does that complexity pay off?
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.140]   We're not being paid
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.500]   to necessarily deliver a superior result.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.780]   It may or may not.
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.580]   We know we can't guarantee that,
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.020]   but we are being paid to manage risks and outcomes
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.100]   and provide advice and planning.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.500]   So if you were to hire a financial advisor
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.900]   and they were charging you 1%
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.060]   to put you in a target date retirement fund,
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.740]   I would think that would be not an appropriate use.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.780]   Other than that, if you wanted a very simple strategy
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.420]   and you were willing to leave it and forget it
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.660]   and were comfortable having all your money
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.980]   in a target date fund,
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.060]   they're very diversified in themselves.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.500]   It's very simple.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.300]   It could be just leave it alone
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.340]   and I don't have to think about it again.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.700]   - So here's a great question.
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.180]   Lots of people make some significant financial mistakes.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.940]   What are some of the ones that you've seen
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.700]   that we can avoid?
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.660]   - Oh my goodness, I have stories.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:47.420]   So the first one that comes to mind is a client.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:52.100]   So he was a pilot and mandatory retirement at 65.
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.740]   And so we'd been planning for years
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.300]   and he was gonna be very comfortable and is,
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.660]   but right before he retired, he came to me and he said,
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.460]   "Dana, I am not gonna need to take anything
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.060]   "out of my portfolio."
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.260]   And I was like, what?
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.380]   Like, why?
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:11.260]   Well, I put this $80,000 in this currency trading program
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.700]   and it is paying me $5,000 a month.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.780]   And I just thought, oh no.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.420]   Like, he's getting real checks
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.140]   and so it's very hard to argue with that,
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.940]   but you know instantly this is not sustainable.
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.340]   It can't be true.
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.620]   And so about four or five months later,
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.260]   it was of course discovered to be a Ponzi scheme.
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.140]   And he did get five months worth of checks back
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.300]   and then lost the remaining amount of the 80,000.
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.860]   Luckily, that was only a small portion of his portfolio.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:46.340]   His core portfolio remained intact and so he's just fine.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:52.940]   The worst that I saw was a client, she was a widow.
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.580]   She had four daughters and remarried
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.740]   and they decided to move their assets to a firm
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.900]   that was of the same religious affiliation as them
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.700]   and had thanked me for all our years of service
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.540]   and they moved on.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.580]   And a few years later, I got a call from the husband
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.340]   and said, we'd really like to come in and see you.
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.500]   It was a $4 million portfolio
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   and they came in and brought me all the paperwork.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.620]   And I literally remember it turning white as a sheet.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.060]   So they had basically signed away all the assets
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.940]   on three promissory notes
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.860]   into private real estate lending things.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.660]   And I had to send them to an attorney,
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.660]   contact the local regulators,
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.140]   but basically that money was gone.
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.660]   And so that was the worst thing I saw
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.240]   of someone that based a decision based on trust
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.300]   and they really got snowballed
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.300]   and just didn't know enough to know the level of risk
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.400]   that they were taking.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.760]   Those are some extreme mistakes.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.660]   Some more common mistakes, concentrated stock risk
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.980]   and so clients that simply won't diversify
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.220]   out of a concentrated stock portfolio,
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.940]   executives at Fortune 500 companies.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.540]   I have some that will absolutely
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.580]   set up a diversification plan,
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:24.100]   one that did not and they'll still be okay,
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.500]   but it's hard to watch.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.700]   One of the foundational things I saw
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.860]   when I first moved to Arizona, I worked for a CPA firm
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.900]   and we were in Mesa, Arizona, which is pretty close to,
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.300]   there's an Intel facility down there.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.140]   And so we had a lot of Intel clients
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:43.180]   and there was a woman who was in mid to late 60s,
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.960]   she had $10 million in Intel stock
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.780]   and we were trying to convince her to diversify,
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.100]   it did not.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.100]   And then the 2001, 2002, Intel went down,
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.260]   I believe it was almost 80%.
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.740]   I know her 10 million went to three.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.700]   And so just someone that refused to diversify
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.200]   that concentrated stock position,
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.180]   that's a more common mistake than you might think
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.820]   and one that could easily be avoided.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.900]   - Yeah, no, I certainly see that one a lot,
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.500]   especially with tech employees, Facebook.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.860]   Yeah, Google, yeah, quite a common one.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.660]   Folks, I'm gonna keep running through the questions,
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.380]   but if you have a question, go ahead, write it down.
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.620]   Christine Benz, she will take her questions from you
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.500]   and then if you're lucky,
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.540]   we'll get them answered by Dana Anspach.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.480]   Let's, oh, here's a great one.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.380]   For someone who will never need to withdraw
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.580]   from their portfolio because of income
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.660]   and perpetuity exceeds expenses,
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.420]   so maybe lots of social security,
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.060]   maybe some rental property, maybe an annuity,
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.560]   and the person is comfortable with equity risk,
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.300]   is there a need for bonds
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.100]   or significant cash in a portfolio?
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:54.820]   - Probably not, although, you know,
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.460]   my understanding of real estate
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.740]   and I now own an Airbnb property myself
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.740]   is it does take deep pockets,
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.740]   so you have to be prepared
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.620]   for whatever repairs might come along.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.220]   I have a good friend who they built
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.860]   their entire net worth on real estate assets,
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.500]   about 10 million.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.100]   Her husband's an engineer and so that was her role
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.700]   was building up their portfolio
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.380]   and she had several properties in Texas
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.860]   in the Houston area when the freeze happened
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.580]   and I remember her telling me,
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.100]   wow, you know, I never really accounted
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.380]   for the fact that all of these properties
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.580]   would be empty at the same time
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.840]   and I would have to replace all of the pipes
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.080]   and yes, there was insurance,
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.520]   but she still had all of the deductible costs,
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.080]   so would there ever be a case
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.140]   if someone had real estate investment
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.900]   where they needed no cash?
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.180]   You know, probably not.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.700]   They're probably gonna need enough cash on the side
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.300]   to cover these types of situations,
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.780]   but if they're comfortable being all equity
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.100]   and they're confident in the cash flows they're getting,
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.900]   you know, they could certainly have
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.420]   a much higher risk portfolio
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.260]   than someone that didn't have that.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.380]   The only other thing that I would add to that
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.380]   is what we saw in 2008 and 2009
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:11.700]   is a lot of people that were relying on dividend portfolios
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.060]   saw their dividends get cut in half
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.620]   and so when people ask, you know,
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.140]   why isn't that our approach?
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.180]   Well, I don't, you know, I don't wanna go through that again
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.260]   and tell a client, oh, I'm sorry, you know,
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.260]   you're gonna have half the amount of cash flow this year
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.700]   that you had last year,
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.940]   and so if you're relying only on the interest income
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.300]   that your portfolio produces,
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.260]   well, that's easier today than it was two years ago,
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.480]   but at the same time, those dividends
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.300]   and those interest rates can change,
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.600]   and so I think you would always want something on the side
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.500]   to cover those gap years,
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.700]   to make sure you had some consistency in cash flow.
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.540]   - Yeah, certainly, so naturally,
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.020]   we can't give an investment advice here,
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.220]   so this is for education purposes only,
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.540]   but it's really dependent upon your personal circumstances,
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.500]   so maybe it makes sense to be really aggressive
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.860]   if you don't have any cash needs,
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.460]   add off from a portfolio, but life is unpredictable.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.140]   We don't really even need a freeze in Texas,
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.420]   it could even be the COVID crisis, right?
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.320]   So maybe if you even had long-term rentals,
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.520]   it wasn't even dependent upon tourism,
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.940]   you know, folks weren't able to make rent,
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.820]   that can be really hard if you need that cash flow
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.120]   from your rental property.
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.940]   - And then if folks want to nerd out
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.180]   on income investing versus total return investing,
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.620]   we interviewed Vanguard's Colleen Giaconetti
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.100]   on episode 26 of the Bill Glatz Live Show,
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.500]   you can get that wherever you get your podcasts.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:35.820]   All right, here is a great question,
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.780]   what is the most actionable tip
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:42.300]   for those of us 50 years and older?
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.760]   - Ooh, most actionable, that's a challenge,
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.980]   because just because you're over 50,
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.860]   you could still be 20 years away from retirement,
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.380]   or you could be five years away from retirement,
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.380]   or you could be wanting to retire in two years,
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.020]   so it's very difficult to narrow that down.
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:04.340]   What I will share is, and I shared this a little bit
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.360]   on stage the other day, is my own retirement plan,
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.020]   so I'm 52, I am 100% equity,
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.340]   and my plan is to do my own projections,
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.900]   the same way I do them for clients,
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.540]   the same way you would for a client,
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.540]   and look out and say, well, if I were to retire at 65,
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.300]   what is the cash flow that I would need
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.180]   for my portfolio during that year?
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.740]   And I will most definitely delay Social Security.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.660]   And so then, around the age of 55,
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.540]   I will transition whatever that dollar amount is,
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.740]   let's just say it was $50,000,
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.180]   and I would buy a bond that matures
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.660]   for the year that I turn 65,
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.180]   and that would be rung one on my income ladder.
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.860]   Now, it's not exactly the year I turn 55.
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.020]   If that's a strong year in the market,
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.980]   for sure, I would do it, but if we're in a bear market,
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.060]   the year I turn 55, then I would probably not build out
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.460]   the first rung of my income ladder quite yet,
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.580]   and probably wait another year.
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.060]   And then, when I'm 56, I would repeat that process,
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.140]   and when I'm 57, I would repeat that process.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.380]   And so, by the time I got to 65,
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.780]   I would have this runway of fixed income assets
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.360]   maturing to meet my expense liabilities,
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.700]   and I would know that I was somewhat insulated
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.300]   from the stock market moves
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.340]   for at least the first 10 years of my retirement.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.300]   And so, I like that process of very slowly
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.100]   building out that income ladder.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.660]   There's been a lot of talk about bond funds
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.500]   versus individual bonds.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:43.500]   I find the behavioral aspects of having the individual bonds,
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.580]   we're talking treasuries, CDs, agencies,
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.140]   is easy to understand.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.740]   And so, when it matures, you spend it.
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.620]   That's your cash flow.
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.020]   It dumps into a cash bucket for the year.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.260]   We typically direct deposit it on a monthly basis,
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.760]   so it replicates someone's paycheck.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.900]   And so, that simplicity,
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.540]   and it helps prevent some of the behavioral challenges
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.380]   that we see.
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.340]   Now, I know most of you here are very disciplined,
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.460]   and so those behavioral challenges
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.180]   may not be such a challenge for you.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.700]   You may be much more disciplined than the average person.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.260]   But I really like that process
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.540]   of slowly building out the income ladder.
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.140]   What we see in our practice a lot
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.180]   is people that come in the year before they retire.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.580]   And so, now we're having to build out,
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:31.820]   if we're gonna do an income ladder,
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.580]   we have to build out all of those rungs at once,
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.340]   versus if they had started about 10 years out,
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.100]   it would be a very slow, gradual process.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.740]   So, I don't know if that's the most actionable item
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.220]   for someone 50 or over,
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.980]   but that's what I would be thinking about
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.620]   if I was looking at transitioning my portfolio
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.420]   toward a decumulation-based portfolio.
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:56.120]   - Oh, this is a fantastic question we just got.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.620]   So, certainly, annuities can be complicated
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.020]   financial products, some of them anyway,
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.140]   but certainly, in some circumstances,
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.100]   they may be helpful tools for retirement planning.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.940]   If someone is looking to purchase an annuity themselves,
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.500]   do the due diligence to make sure
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.260]   they're buying the right type of product for them.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.180]   What are some objective resources
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.760]   you can suggest on researching annuities?
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.220]   - Ooh, that is a really good question.
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:27.060]   I don't know if blueprint income is still around.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.260]   Does anyone, I hear some nods.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.340]   So, I know that is a good resource.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.940]   We have, often, as quirky as he is,
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.700]   if you've seen Stan, the annuity man's resources,
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.340]   he will tell it to you straight.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.240]   He has a lot of books out there on annuities,
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.060]   and so he has some excellent resources, too.
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.040]   And then, I believe there's just some simple websites,
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.660]   like immediateannuities.com.
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.380]   Now, I don't know if that one has since sold.
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:59.860]   And so, when you put your name in,
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.600]   if they bombard you with quotes,
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.180]   that would be my concern.
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.540]   So, a lot of those websites, you can run quotes,
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.980]   but you have to put your email address
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.340]   and your phone number in, and if you're like me,
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.820]   you don't wanna get bombarded by sales calls
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.780]   from those kinds of things,
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.660]   so you have to be a little bit cautious about that.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:20.660]   We work with organizations that work with fee-only advisors.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.940]   So, we work with companies like DPL.
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.940]   There's another one called RetireOne.
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.780]   And so, they will help bring fee-only
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.900]   or no-commissioned annuity products
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.100]   that we can suggest or run quotes on,
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.340]   and we also have a commissioned annuity agent,
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.080]   so it's hard for me to know what's out there
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.640]   that you can work with directly.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.620]   - Super.
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:43.740]   Folks, I'm gonna keep running through
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.040]   these questions for Dana.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.020]   If you've got questions for Dana, write them down,
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.500]   and Christine Bennis, she will collect them from you.
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.160]   Oh, we've got another one in the back there.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.260]   Here, we've got another investing question.
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:27:00.120]   What are your thoughts on MLPs in a retirement portfolio?
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.120]   - MLP, okay.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.500]   - Master Limited Partnerships, yes, yeah.
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.820]   - I love so many acronyms in this business.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:12.680]   I haven't seen MLPs in portfolios in a long time,
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.000]   so I did spend a few years at Merrill Lynch in my career,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.400]   and we would see them more frequently then.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.120]   I know at that time,
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.880]   they were very high interest-bearing investments
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.160]   or dividend-producing investments.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.160]   So, I don't know.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.480]   We don't use them.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.080]   I think my answer to that question
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.560]   will be going back to a different approach.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.220]   When we look at different retirement income approaches,
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.560]   we saw about total return this weekend,
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.200]   we talked about income annuities,
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.360]   and we talked about probability first
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.000]   and time segmentation.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.600]   One that didn't really show up,
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.080]   that used to be more popular,
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.000]   was what I called the income-only approach,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.560]   where people built a portfolio
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.440]   and simply lived off the interest and the dividends.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.240]   Well, that got a lot less popular
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.360]   when interest rates were zero for a decade.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.200]   You couldn't do it.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.960]   And so, I think we stopped hearing about it.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.160]   So, if you wanted to build a portfolio
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.960]   where you only lived off the interest and dividends,
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.640]   that could be a place where something like an MLP
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.660]   could have a position in your portfolio.
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:21.260]   I'm more of an index fund, like most of you.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:22.960]   I think simpler is better.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.540]   I love index funds, so they're not my cup of tea.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.440]   - Yeah, I'm with you there.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.800]   All right, here's a question I get all the time
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.560]   when working with folks, and I would imagine you do, too,
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.000]   when you're working with someone for the first time.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.120]   If I have a complex portfolio,
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.640]   do you suggest ripping off the Band-Aid
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.200]   or more slowly moving towards a simple portfolio?
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.440]   - That is a challenging question.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.800]   Some of it depends on if it's in taxable accounts
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.480]   or if it's all in tax-deferred accounts.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.120]   It can be very easy to rip off the Band-Aid
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.360]   if everything is in IRAs and Roth IRAs,
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.960]   but when you're looking at holdings
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.320]   that are in taxable accounts
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   and you have a lot of low-cost basis assets,
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.380]   then it's usually a much slower approach.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.880]   - And then we got a great tip here.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.040]   To learn more about Master Limited Partnerships,
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.160]   see the Bogleheads Wiki.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.200]   Thank you, Lady Geek.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.040]   Yep, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.840]   Extra tax challenges with that MLP route.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.720]   All right, awesome.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.800]   Fantastic.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   And then we have a similar question with respect to
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.160]   what is the best strategy to mitigate,
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.800]   and again, this goes back to ripping off the Band-Aid or not,
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.080]   best strategy for mitigating capital gains
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   on a $1 million single stock position
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.080]   with a $300,000 cost basis.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.440]   And again, not specific investment advice, folks.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.960]   - No, no.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.160]   So one, I'd have to know, of that $1 million,
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.120]   what portion of your portfolio is that, right?
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.840]   Might only be 10% of your portfolio.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.400]   It could be a $10 million portfolio.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.480]   It could be all your portfolio in a single stock.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.800]   And so if it's all your portfolio in a single stock
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.100]   and this million dollars is what you have to live off
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.700]   the rest of your life,
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.300]   I'd be much more prone to rip off the Band-Aid
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.800]   and say, let's reduce that single stock risk.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.140]   I don't care what stock it is.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.720]   I don't care how great it's been.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.720]   I don't care what you think it's gonna do.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.240]   Like, you could lose your entire life savings.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.680]   Reality, you could.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.280]   And so why take that risk?
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.840]   Why would you take that risk?
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.600]   Just pay the tax and diversify.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.560]   But if that $1 million was part of a $10 million portfolio
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.080]   or you had substantial social security or pension
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.240]   or other rental income coming in,
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.380]   it might be a completely different story
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.220]   where you could very slowly scale out of it
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.720]   in a more tax-efficient way.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.920]   - Yeah, I think you nailed it.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.080]   It basically comes down to what is your ability
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.960]   to manage the risk if that million dollars
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.440]   goes to zero tomorrow?
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.460]   So if you've got other income sources,
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.820]   then certainly that million dollars going to zero
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:11.660]   wouldn't feel great,
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.720]   but at least you could manage that risk.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.240]   I think about someone that I worked with not too long ago.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.980]   They were a trust fund kid.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.820]   So effectively, they hadn't really worked a day
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.740]   in their life, couldn't really generate their own income,
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.940]   and they had 90% of their net worth in one stock.
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:29.620]   Now, it was a great stock, don't get me wrong,
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.560]   but without the ability to manage the risk
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.080]   of that stock going to zero,
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.320]   they simply had to pay the taxes, diversify,
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.020]   make their investments less risky.
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:43.280]   All right, gosh, here's another great annuity question.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.500]   I'm age 70.
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.620]   What are the pros and cons of purchasing a SPIA,
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.460]   a single premium immediate annuity
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.680]   that's effectively you're gonna buy yourself a pension,
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.220]   you put in a lump sum once,
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.180]   you get an income stream for life,
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.540]   versus waiting until age 80 to buy that SPIA,
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.260]   or simply using a deferred annuity?
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.100]   So similarly, that's gonna be,
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.660]   hey, I put that lump sum in now,
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:07.020]   and then at age 80, that income kicks on.
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.940]   What are your thoughts there?
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.540]   - Well, technically, in the immediate annuities,
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:15.060]   you are participating in something called mortality credits.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.580]   Sounds, you know, it's not an exciting thing to talk about.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.900]   And I can't remember the technical age,
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.860]   but there is a point where you get essentially
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.220]   more participation in the mortality credits.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.140]   I see Christine nodding her head.
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.900]   I seem to remember at a conference, an industry conference,
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.620]   I'm talking at around age 72, 73.
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.240]   So it is possible that there could be a benefit
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.820]   to waiting a few more years before you purchase that SPIA,
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.500]   but don't quote me on that right now.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.780]   The insurance nerds will have those statistics
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.040]   somewhere out on the internet, I'm sure.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.000]   You know, the other pros and cons,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.260]   a lot of it has already come up
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.520]   in some of the things other speakers have talked about.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.780]   Do you just wanna lock in the outcome?
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.340]   You know, you are cognitively aware
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.940]   of the decision you're making now.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.760]   Will you be at 80?
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.140]   And so you know the value of your assets today.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.500]   We know where interest rates are right now.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.500]   In 10 years, could we be back down
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.780]   to lower interest rates again?
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.060]   We don't know.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.060]   And so I can say, you know, it's a better time
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.420]   to buy a SPIA now than it was two years ago,
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.580]   but we don't know what that will look like
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.860]   10 years from now.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.820]   So, you know, we don't know the future.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.020]   You have to base that decision on your situation
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.420]   and what is really appropriate for you today,
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.640]   as it stands today.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.000]   - Here is a really interesting question
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.600]   and curious how this shows up in your practice.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.020]   How and when should one discuss their assets
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.660]   with their adult children?
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.440]   - This is a great question.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.880]   You know your family, right?
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.040]   And so I think it's wonderful
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.020]   when people do bring their adult children in.
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.460]   We've had meetings where we set up Zoom calls
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.440]   where we walk the whole family
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.240]   through the client's financial plan.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.840]   In a healthy family,
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.840]   the children are gonna care about you, right?
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.600]   They're gonna care just as much as you care about them.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.280]   And most children in a healthy functioning family
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.480]   are gonna be concerned
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.660]   that their parents might run out of money.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.440]   And so in those situations,
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.360]   I think it can be really useful to have a family meeting
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.240]   and have someone walk through the whole thing
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.680]   and you're reassuring them that you're okay,
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.840]   that you're gonna be able to take care of yourself.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.840]   In a unhealthy family dynamic, that could backfire.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.040]   And so it's hard because I think you know your family,
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.620]   you know your adult children,
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.480]   you know which ones are gonna be responsible
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.560]   with the information that you might share.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.240]   And so you're gonna have to weigh all of that out
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.240]   in making that decision.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.120]   - Yeah, certainly.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.680]   Absent any sort of spendthrift considerations,
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.000]   sooner is better.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.520]   We don't know when ill health is gonna show up,
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.960]   so being bread prepared helps you in that situation.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.000]   Thank you, Christine.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.040]   We interviewed Cameron Huddleston
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.380]   on episode 34 of the "Bogleheads" live show.
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.600]   She's author of "How to Talk to Your Parents
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.000]   "About Their Finances."
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.800]   And she shared a story about how her mom
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.840]   had dementia onset at a relatively early age, right?
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.960]   And for her, her mother, Cameron's mother,
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.760]   didn't necessarily put together in place
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.800]   the right estate planning pieces beforehand
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.520]   to make Cameron's life easier.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.240]   So we don't know when ill health is gonna show up,
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.240]   so doing that planning sooner, that helps manage that risk.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.680]   All right, we've got lots of more great questions
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.080]   from the community here.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.440]   Great job, guys, keeping them coming.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.960]   Lot of questions about bond ladders.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.680]   So since you do that in your firm, let's talk about that.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.560]   We have one question here that wants to know
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.840]   about what type of specific bonds you invest in
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.960]   in taking that bond ladder approach.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:15.320]   - Well, treasuries, munis, CDs, agencies, not corporates.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.960]   With the exception that in smaller accounts,
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.040]   we will use bullet shares, which is a package
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.720]   of corporate bonds that all mature in the same year.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.280]   So it will depend on the client.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.160]   Like so much of what we say.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.720]   You know, if their tax rate's high enough
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.400]   and they have a large taxable account,
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.480]   we may be building that portion of the bond ladder
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.600]   using muni bonds.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.360]   Sometimes it's state-specific,
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.260]   particularly if they're in California.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:43.700]   Sometimes it's national munis if they're in a no state tax,
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:47.080]   no income tax state, you get that correct.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.800]   And then agencies and treasuries and CDs would be our go-tos
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.680]   so we really don't like to take risk
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.080]   on the fixed income side.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.400]   I know that question came up earlier.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.320]   We'd rather take risk where we think it has
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.360]   a higher probability of paying off,
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.180]   which is on the equity side.
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:06.880]   And so then it will just depend on where we're gonna get
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.760]   the highest yield at that time.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.400]   The fixed income market can be far more complex
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.840]   than the stock market, and so it can vary from day to day.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.240]   One day you might get a higher yield than an agency,
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.040]   the next day it could be a CD.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.080]   It really can vary depending on where the bond market
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.000]   is at that day.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.800]   - Practical question, what do I do with all the funds
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.920]   in my employer-provided retirement plan
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.600]   when I'm ready to retire?
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.680]   Yeah, I'll leave it at that.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.360]   - Well, that's a good question also.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.360]   I don't know because I don't know what those funds are.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.040]   And there's all kinds of pros and cons
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.480]   to rolling over your 401(k) into an IRA.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.760]   Some 401(k) plans have unique investment options
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.640]   like stable value funds.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:57.200]   And in the past decade, that may not be true today,
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.280]   but we could earn a higher yield in those stable value funds
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.360]   than by building out a fixed income bond ladder.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.560]   And so that was a reason to leave a large portion
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.140]   of the money in the employer plan,
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.120]   to take advantage of some of those investment options.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.160]   If you wanna build a actual bond ladder,
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.400]   it's very difficult to do within a 401(k).
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.540]   They may allow you to do it
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.640]   if they have the self-directed brokerage option.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.160]   So if you're in a company large enough
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.880]   where they allow you to open,
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.360]   it's usually either a Schwab or Fidelity brokerage account,
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.620]   you can do that.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.720]   Some of the challenges that I see,
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:37.280]   401(k)s decide to change plan providers.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.720]   You get a blackout notice.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.060]   The money has to move to a new provider.
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.560]   That can happen at any time during retirement.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.320]   Now you have to revisit everything.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.720]   We just have a client that got a notice of this happening.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.080]   He does have a self-directed brokerage account.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.840]   In their case, they're gonna allow all the investments
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.560]   in that self-directed brokerage account
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.520]   to transfer in kind to the new brokerage firm
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.480]   with the 401(k) so they won't have to liquidate them,
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.440]   which is a nice option.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.320]   But there's all kinds of complexities
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.400]   that you would need to address
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   or we would need to know to actually answer that question.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.680]   There's other things I've seen.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.080]   If you have outside accounts,
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.920]   a 401(k) requires its own required minimum distribution.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.640]   And so if you also have an IRA,
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.600]   it will require its own required minimum distribution
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.520]   versus if you have two IRAs,
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.560]   you could take the RMD, consolidate the RMD amount
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.640]   and take it all out of one.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.280]   But you can't take the 401(k) RMD out of an IRA.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.360]   So if you don't want that level of complexity,
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.320]   that could be a reason to consolidate.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.120]   I've also seen cases where 401(k)s will have restrictions
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.120]   on how often you can change the investments
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.600]   or how often you can take withdrawals.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.720]   So if you wanted to set up a direct deposit
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.220]   on a monthly basis to replicate your paycheck,
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.560]   that may be more challenging
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.280]   or sometimes they tack on administration fees.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.400]   So all of those things would have to be considered.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.600]   - As touched on in the last session,
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.360]   that workplace retirement plan, that 401(k),
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.440]   that ERISA plan, state by state,
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.360]   you may be looking at better credit protection
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.640]   in that account, but again, it does vary state by state.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.480]   So you can speak with an attorney in your state
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.120]   to figure out just how much credit protection
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.800]   you might be losing if you move from that ERISA plan,
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.640]   that 401(k) to a rollover IRA.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.480]   Thank you.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.480]   - All right, here's a great question.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.240]   I am sitting on a large capital loss,
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:29.640]   unrealized capital loss in my investment account
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.080]   from a company that went bankrupt
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.120]   and I can't stand to sell it.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.020]   Any guidance you can give this person?
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:42.220]   - I think Mike Piper talked about mental health.
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:50.720]   So if the company went bankrupt, I mean, that's hard, right?
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.720]   It is hard to manage your own investments,
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.480]   even for us advisors.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.000]   So, you know, I have my retirement portfolio
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   and I do with it exactly what I would do with the clients.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.300]   And then I have this other pot of money
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:07.000]   that I do horrible things with and it never works out.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.560]   And so why is it that it's so much harder
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.400]   to make decisions on our own money?
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.280]   And it really is, right?
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.240]   It's just, it's harder to be disciplined.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.300]   And so you're sitting on this large capital loss.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.340]   It absolutely would make sense to sell it
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.960]   unless you really think that that company's
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.720]   coming out of bankruptcy and, you know,
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.640]   gonna do something spectacular.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.840]   And so I don't know.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.720]   I don't know what advice to give you
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.400]   other than Mike Piper's advice
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.380]   that a mental health professional might be appropriate.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.600]   - Yeah, no, certainly seems reasonable.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.040]   All right, any suggestions on how to balance
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.280]   tax treatment of accounts by the amount that's in them,
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.420]   taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free?
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:53.060]   - How to balance them is the question?
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.580]   - Yeah, what guidance do you give
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.620]   when working with folks on how to balance
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.460]   how much you have in each of those account types?
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:02.880]   - Well, it's interesting 'cause most of the folks we see
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.740]   are at the tail end of that decision-making process, right?
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.280]   They're getting ready to live off their acorns.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.940]   They're in the decumulation phase.
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.100]   So that decision has already been made.
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.020]   So I can answer that question
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.100]   from the rear view mirror standpoint
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.220]   that it is better to get to retirement
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:22.260]   usually with the diversification of account types.
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.280]   And so the most challenging retirement plans
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.100]   or the most constrained plans we often see
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.500]   are people who have usually over a million,
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.420]   sometimes two million, all in a tax-deferred account.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:38.260]   Usually it was a 401(k) or employer plan and nothing else.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.940]   No, nothing else.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:42.860]   And so there is not a lot of flexibility there.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.740]   Every dollar is gonna be taxed.
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.380]   There's not a lot of tax planning opportunities.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:51.940]   And so I do think as you're saving along the way,
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.860]   making sure that you're building up
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.900]   buckets of both tax-deferred and taxable accounts
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.780]   can give you a lot more flexibility
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.080]   when you get to the distribution phase.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.620]   - I like this next question
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.420]   because it is thinking about that worst case,
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.500]   which I'm always thinking about.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.980]   So this question asks,
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.740]   should I be thinking about splitting my assets
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.060]   between multiple brokerages
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.020]   in the case of a cybersecurity hack
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.160]   or being locked out of my account?
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.900]   - I personally don't think that's necessary.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.860]   I have seen people, however,
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:27.820]   who wanna keep their assets across multiple custodians
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.760]   just in case something were to happen at the custodial level.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.240]   And so I understand that.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.460]   Do I personally think it's necessary?
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.380]   No, I really don't.
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:41.940]   I think the level of security in our financial institutions
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.980]   and being able to set up two-factor
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.980]   and learning about cybersecurity yourself
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.220]   offers a great deal of protection.
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.900]   But I can certainly understand why
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.700]   in a kind of Armageddon scenario,
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.580]   why someone might wanna have a pot of money
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.100]   in the second place.
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:59.040]   - Yeah, I'd certainly echo that.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.260]   I don't think it's absolutely necessary,
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.540]   but I don't think it's unreasonable either.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.560]   And the other thing I encourage folks to think about
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.540]   is in making that decision,
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:06.980]   not for some folks, if you're,
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:07.900]   maybe you're still working
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:08.900]   or maybe if you're just leaving
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.380]   your old workplace plan as is
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:12.300]   because you wanna maintain that credit protection,
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.140]   it's an old 401k,
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.980]   it's got some good investment options in there,
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.100]   maybe your money is gonna be split
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.500]   across two different investment accounts anyway.
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:24.180]   All right, let's jump to,
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.980]   can you tell us more about the client
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.580]   with a $3 million portfolio
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:30.240]   and qualifying for healthcare tax credits?
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.540]   - Well, yes, they have both taxable account
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:39.800]   and they have tax deferred IRA accounts.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.020]   And so in a laddered bond strategy,
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.700]   when that bond matures,
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.460]   that's not taxable income, right?
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.660]   Only the interest income on the bond
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.180]   is what's showing up on your tax return each year is a 1099.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.380]   And so they're able to have,
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:58.180]   I think they draw $11,000 a month out of their portfolio,
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.340]   but their actual AGI taxable income
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:04.900]   has basically remained under 40,000 a year.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.620]   So they're able to qualify for the healthcare tax credits,
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:11.200]   even though they have a substantial portfolio
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.720]   and they're able to have that $11,000 a month cashflow
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.680]   because everything else in the portfolio
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.960]   is primarily long-term capital gains
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.560]   and we're not gonna realize it
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.400]   and then we'll do the rebalancing
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.220]   after they're 65 and around Medicare.
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:29.440]   - Dana, thank you so much for answering all these questions.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.740]   Any final thoughts before I let you go?
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.360]   - It is absolutely an honor to be here.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.800]   And so I just wanna thank all of you.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.320]   You make people like me better with your questions.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.560]   And I had shared with a few people earlier,
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.560]   I started writing online in about 2007.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.880]   It was always a member of the Boglehead community
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.200]   that would reach out with corrections to my articles,
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.960]   suggestions to my articles.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.960]   And you may laugh, someone asks, didn't that annoy you?
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.040]   No, I was always so grateful for it
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.760]   because it made me better.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.440]   And so I really appreciate this
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.400]   and the opportunity to be here.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.720]   - Wonderful, thank you, Dana.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:09.880]   (audience applauding)
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.120]   (applause)
