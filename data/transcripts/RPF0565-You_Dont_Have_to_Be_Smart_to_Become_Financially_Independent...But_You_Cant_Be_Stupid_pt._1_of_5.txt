[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:57.320]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less. My name is Joshua, I am your host, and today we kick off part one of a five-part series called "You Don't Have to Be Smart to Become Financially Independent, But You Can't Be Stupid." Again, you don't have to be smart to become financially independent.

[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.300]   I'm not going to be very radical. Because, I don't want you to think that you have to be pretty hardcore radical in order to get good results. You don't. You just can't be stupid. Let's talk about income. In order to build financial independence in a reasonable amount of time, you need to have a strong income. Now, I don't quite know how to define strong income. Obviously, that's subjective. Your strong income will vary depending on how you define it.
