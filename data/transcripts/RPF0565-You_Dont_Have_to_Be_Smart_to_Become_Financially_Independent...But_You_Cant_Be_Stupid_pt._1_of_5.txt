[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.360]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.280]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.480]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua. I am your
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.680]   host and today we kick off part one of a five-part series called You Don't Have to Be Smart to
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.400]   Become Financially Independent, But You Can't Be Stupid. Again, you don't have to be smart
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.520]   to become financially independent, but you can't be stupid. As I unfold this series for
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:11.520]   you, you're going to hear me approach it using many, many examples from what I call the common
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.760]   man lifestyle. I don't want you to come away from my show thinking that you have to get
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.080]   a PhD in financial planning in order to make good financial decisions. You don't. You probably
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.840]   already know everything that you need to know to become financially independent. I don't
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.600]   want you to come away from my show thinking that in order for you to become financially
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.600]   independent, you have to go back to school and earn an advanced degree unless you want
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.160]   to. I don't want you thinking that you have to live in a bus unless you want to. I don't
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.360]   want you thinking that you have to create the world's next great company that goes international
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.920]   and do your IPO and that's when you're going to make your fortune unless you have such
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.800]   an opportunity. These things are your decisions, but you don't have to do any of that stuff.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.240]   You don't actually have to be very smart to become financially independent, but you can't
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.240]   be stupid.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.900]   Today, I'm going to talk about your income and talk to you about how you can build an
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.240]   income and what kind of income you have to earn in order to become financially independent.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.440]   I'm organizing this five-part series around my framework of wealth, which is my own intellectual
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.560]   property. It's a five-part, 10-word outline that I use to organize financial information.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.020]   Everything that I know about finance can be organized into this framework. Every piece
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.360]   of advice I've ever given about finance fits into this framework. I created it. It's been
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.640]   now taken across the internet, which is to be expected, but I created it and it's just
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.500]   something I want you to take and I hope that you find it useful.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.080]   These five parts are very simply this. One, increase income. Two, decrease expenses. Three,
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.980]   invest wisely. Four, avoid catastrophe. And five, optimize lifestyle. But in today's show
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.600]   and in this series of shows, I'm not going to be using extreme examples. I'm not going
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.880]   to be very radical because I don't want you to think that you have to be pretty hardcore
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.920]   radical in order to get good results. You don't. You just can't be stupid.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.900]   Let's talk about income. In order to build financial independence in a reasonable amount
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.920]   of time, you need to have a strong income. Now, I don't quite know how to define strong
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.780]   income. Obviously, that's subjective. Your strong income will vary depending on where
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.880]   you live and what you do. But let me give you a couple of thoughts. First, a strong
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.060]   income would mean at least a median wage level of earning. In the United States of America,
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.020]   median household income is currently about $55,000 per year. So you should be earning
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.760]   at least about $55,000 per year. If you're not there, this is a huge area of opportunity
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   for you.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.820]   Now, moving on from there, I think any person who is focused and diligent can earn six figures,
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.420]   $100,000. Now, obviously, $100,000 doesn't buy today what $100,000 bought 30 years ago,
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.600]   but $100,000 still buys quite a bit. And you can buy a lot with $100,000. Here's what's
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.140]   cool about these wages. You don't have to be particularly smart to earn $100,000 per
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:24.180]   year in the United States of America, but you can't be stupid. You also can't be lazy.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.320]   In this series, as I said, I'm going to give you many common man examples. I'm going to
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.740]   give you blue collar examples instead of white collar examples of income. I'm going to give
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.380]   you ordinary suburban expense levels instead of weird radical levels of expenses. But if
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.780]   you'll just simply focus on working hard and earning an income, you'll put yourself in
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.740]   a situation where you can have the income levels that you need to build financial independence.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.860]   I have known people in every single industry, in every blue, major blue collar industry
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.400]   who are in $100,000 a year and started with no education, no experience. I've known people
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.700]   who started, I had a client one time, a client of mine who started working at McDonald's
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:15.400]   as an entry level worker at McDonald's and worked his way through the McDonald's university
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:23.660]   process to become a middle manager for a significant local franchise group, earning about $140,000
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:30.260]   per year. And he did it in a couple of decades. I've known a friend of mine, started off at
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.280]   16 years old while he was in high school, apprenticing in the electrical trades. He
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.120]   apprenticed as a helper, as an electrician. Then when he got out of high school, he went
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.700]   to work as an electrician. He studied. Today, he earns in excess of six figures working
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.940]   for as an electrician. And in his case, he transitioned to working for a large electrical
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.080]   company. And so in addition to a very strong salary, he has all kinds of cushy benefits,
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.960]   which are frequently not offered in the household electric construction, electric industry.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.400]   I've known people who started in farming with nothing and built up a six figure income.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.760]   I've known people who did it in all kinds of situations. And so if they can do it, you
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:18.880]   can do it too. But you have to be hardworking and diligent. If you just simply look at how
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:26.480]   the common man earns his money, he earns it in an hourly wage. And frequently he's entitled
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:34.280]   to overtime. Now, when you start running the numbers, if you'll work 50, 60, 70 hours a
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:41.600]   week, much of the time you'll earn a lot of money, even if your hourly rate is not particularly
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.240]   high. Let's say that your hourly rate is $35 an hour, which would be 30 to $35 an hour
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:55.080]   would be a very normal income for somebody who is a skilled tradesman. 30 to $35, let's
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.560]   drop it down, $30 an hour, $30 an hour times 60 hours a week. And let's say that you do
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:08.760]   that 50 weeks per year, that's $90,000 per year of income. You can take yourself from
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.200]   entry level, which entry level in today's world is probably about 14, 15 bucks an hour.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.520]   You can take yourself from entry level and double that in a few years, five years. And
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.920]   if you'll put in 60 hours a week, regularly, week after week, you'll put yourself in the
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:30.320]   situation of earning a six figure income. Now, let's say that you're a common man, you
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.440]   have simple, ordinary skills, but you're willing to work hard. If you're willing to go into
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.480]   one of the trades or one of the opportunities where you can earn a higher level of income
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:50.200]   due to a dangerous job, due to adverse work conditions, you can earn way more. Go and
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.520]   work on an oil rig out in the middle of the ocean. Go and volunteer as a mercenary, working
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.440]   for a contractor, a defense contractor, and ship out overseas and do a tour there. Go
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:07.960]   and take a job working on a fishing boat. These types of jobs that are incredibly demanding
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:15.460]   and incredibly difficult can also be very profitable. So if you'll just simply focus
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:22.920]   on earning a significant amount of money, you'll have the foundation that you need.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:28.600]   Now, you don't need to make any radical career change. Here's what you can do. Look at your
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:36.160]   job and look one level above you, two levels above you, and try to figure out what did
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:42.700]   those people do? What skills did they develop in order to advance to that level of earning?
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.720]   If you work on a factory floor, then look at the manager and ask yourself, what did
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.920]   that manager do? Here's my recommendation. Go and ask that manager what they did to be
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:09:00.880]   prepared for that next level. I worked with a guy one time who was, he worked for one
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.080]   of these uniform companies that takes uniforms in and processes uniforms, et cetera. He started
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.360]   on the factory floor, but he didn't stay there. He started washing uniforms and then doing
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.880]   the delivery routes. And then he moved into the management program and he moved his way
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:19.040]   up. This is the normal way of advancement. And it doesn't take much for you to get into
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:29.280]   it. You have to be hardworking, diligent, reasonably conscientious, and reasonably capable.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.960]   I know so many business owners who own blue collar businesses. The biggest challenge they
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:40.960]   find finding people who are capable of making that jump from employee to manager. But if
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.080]   you'll make that jump from employee to manager and give it a few years, most businesses will
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:52.600]   pay you six figures for that. So recognize that you need to earn a strong income. If
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.380]   you don't have a strong income, it's very hard for you to save enough money in order
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:02.760]   to become financially independent. But you don't have to be super smart to earn a strong
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:10.080]   income. A modest level of work ethic is sufficient. A modest level of conscientious behavior is
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:17.320]   sufficient. A modest level of interest in your career is sufficient. Why do I say modest?
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.760]   Well perhaps in some industries you have very competitive work environments. If you're an
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.200]   attorney and you're trying to make partner, a modest level of effort is probably not going
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.120]   to be sufficient. But if you're working in the oil chain shop and you were going to become
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:38.580]   a certified mechanic, modest level of work ethic is sufficient. You can go ahead and
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.840]   make that jump with modest changes. Because frequently the challenge that the business
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:52.320]   owner faces is how to actually get an employee to show up. Show up on time. Show up not drunk.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:59.700]   You don't have to be a superstar. Just a little bit above average will do. You don't have
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.720]   to be smart to be financially independent, but you can't be stupid.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:12.160]   So my question in closing, in your career and in your income, are you being stupid?
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.960]   Are you doing something that is stupid? If so, stop and apply yourself to the opportunities
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.200]   that you have. Don't worry about shipping out across the country. Just explore the opportunities
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.880]   that are in front of you. If you want a little bit more, explore a little bit harder. If
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.580]   you want to double your income, explore around a little bit. In every place I've been, every
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:40.280]   town I've been in, I've always found that if you'll just start asking people, all of
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.380]   a sudden people will start telling you about the people they know who are earning a lot
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:50.120]   of money. Here's my suggestion. When people are telling you about people they know who
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.800]   are earning a lot of money, pay attention because they're probably people who are similar
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:05.400]   to you and they're probably doing something that you can do too. But that's up to you.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.220]   Thank you for listening. You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm grateful
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.720]   for that. And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:20.140]   and tactics and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals. Before
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:26.440]   you go, three simple requests. One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:33.920]   show, make a plan to take action on it. Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:40.440]   of itself doesn't automatically lead to a life change. It's action that leads to a life
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:47.800]   change. So take action. Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:54.040]   share it with somebody that you care about. I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:01.200]   me in helping me to propagate the message that I'm seeking to share. That helps the
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.860]   person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because teaching others is
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:13.240]   one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement your learning.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.540]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you, and if you're gaining financial
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.240]   benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful if you'd consider paying me for
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:30.120]   this work voluntarily. Come by radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron and you can sign up there to support the show

[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.800]   page. You can support me with a dollar a month, $5 a month, $10 a month, any number that seems
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:47.120]   right to you. But if you're gaining financial benefit from this show, and if it's achieving
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:53.800]   financial results in your life, I'd be grateful for your financial support at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
