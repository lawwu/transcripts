[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The scientific data tell us that we should all be getting
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   anywhere from 150 minutes to 200 minutes per week,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.640]   minimum, of zone two cardio,
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.720]   for sake of cardiovascular health, cerebrovascular health,
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.100]   and a number of other aspects of health
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.980]   that are important essentially to everybody
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.460]   for health span and lifespan.
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.520]   Now, many people, including myself,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.720]   schedule zone two cardio into their weekly fitness regimen.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.720]   So for me, I have one day a week.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.140]   For me, it falls on a Sunday where I go out for a jog
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.880]   that lasts anywhere from 60 minutes to 90 minutes.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.240]   It's a slow jog.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.360]   I can maintain nasal breathing the entire time
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.000]   or have a conversation with somebody else or myself
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.520]   the entire time if I like.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.240]   Or sometimes it consists of a hike by myself
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.760]   or with other people.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.600]   And sometimes those hikes extend anywhere from an hour
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.040]   to four hours, depending on the circumstances, et cetera.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.560]   I will mention that whenever possible,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.440]   I try and do that once a week zone two cardio session
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.320]   out of doors because I like being in nature
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.560]   and I like getting sunlight and I like getting fresh air.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.200]   Now, during the discussion with Dr. Andy Galpin,
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.720]   I explained how I get my zone two cardio.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.620]   And I acknowledged that that once a week session
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.640]   doesn't always allow me to reach that 150 minute
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.920]   to 200 minute minimum threshold of zone two cardio per week.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.360]   Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.580]   And his response to that was very reassuring.
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.600]   What he said was, look, if you want to schedule
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.040]   zone two cardio and head out for a long Sunday jog
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.760]   or hike, terrific.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.840]   If you want to schedule zone two cardio as two
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.040]   or more sessions on the treadmill or on the bike, great.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.920]   But that he doesn't actually think of zone two cardio
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.080]   as exercise at all.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.440]   And to that, I gasped.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.800]   And then I was a little bit deflated.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.880]   I thought, oh, great, I'm doing all this zone two cardio
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.120]   and you don't even consider that exercise.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.140]   And then when he said it was very reassuring,
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.420]   and I think it's going to be very reassuring to all of you,
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.840]   he said, first of all, zone two cardio
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.660]   is absolutely critical to our health
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.340]   for a number of reasons that I already mentioned.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.540]   But in addition to that, zone two cardio does not impede
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.180]   and in fact can enhance our other aspects of fitness.
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.700]   So for example, our strength training,
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.260]   our hypertrophy training, or any type of speed work
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.900]   or other types of cardiovascular training one might do.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.040]   And that the best way to get zone two cardio is,
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.400]   okay, if you want to schedule it, schedule it as a session,
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.880]   but that to simply increase the amount of walking
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.480]   and in particular walking at a rapid pace that one does,
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.360]   and to increase the total amount of movement
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.600]   that one's getting throughout the week.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.960]   So taking groceries in and out of the grocery store,
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.500]   running around with the kids,
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.920]   taking a walk with a coworker
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.600]   while having a work discussion,
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.920]   taking your calls for work while pacing in the office
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.000]   or going outside, what he impressed on me
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.200]   is that zone two cardio can be meshed
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.520]   throughout the daily activities
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.240]   that I and everybody else generally have to do.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.020]   And this was of great relief to me
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.120]   because I, as many of you are, am extremely busy.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.320]   I don't have time to schedule in more cardio per week,
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.000]   or at least I don't see the way I could do that
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.800]   without reducing the amount of sleep that I'm getting
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.600]   or without reducing the amount of social connection
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.920]   that I'm getting with family and friends,
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.580]   both of which are extremely important
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.620]   to our mental health and physical health.
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.920]   So the basic tool here is, yes,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.640]   get 200 minutes per week minimum of zone two cardio.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.880]   And notice I said 200 minutes,
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.840]   not 150 minutes to 200 minutes.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.480]   I'm going to set the higher threshold
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.320]   of 200 minutes per week minimum of zone two cardio,
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.560]   but that you don't need to schedule that
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.600]   as time on the treadmill.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.200]   If you want to, great.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.040]   But what was communicated to me from Dr. Andy Galpin
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.440]   is that zone two cardio is immensely beneficial.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.600]   It's not going to impede,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.880]   and in fact, it's going to improve other aspects of fitness,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.120]   and that it does not have to impede,
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.600]   and it in fact can improve other aspects of our daily life,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.680]   like our ability to engage socially,
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.600]   our ability to have a great output at work
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.500]   in whatever type of work you do.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.080]   So the message is very simple.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.200]   Get 200 minutes or more of zone two cardio per week.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.640]   And the message is also a very reassuring one,
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.480]   which is that that zone two cardio
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.840]   can be spread throughout your daily activities,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.000]   and that if you're doing enough of it,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.680]   you probably don't even have to count
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.000]   the total amount of zone two cardio that you're getting.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.960]   If you simply make the effort to move around a lot more
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.920]   during your daily activities,
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.180]   and to mesh that zone two cardio with your daily activities,
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.360]   you're going to hit that threshold
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.520]   of 200 minutes per week minimum.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.460]   Now, that's a great message for me,
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.080]   because I'm already doing
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.000]   the three resistance training workouts per week.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.840]   I'm doing what now I can just call
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.720]   the two other cardiovascular training workouts per week,
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.400]   because now I don't even count that long Sunday jog
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.040]   or Sunday hike as exercise.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.740]   I just consider that movement out of doors on the weekend.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.680]   And in doing so,
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.320]   it's also allowed me to really enjoy that a lot more.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.200]   There's something about considering something,
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.040]   a fitness training program,
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.280]   that shifts it from just recreation and enjoying life
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.360]   to training.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.000]   And I, of course, love training.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.960]   I love training in the gym,
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.140]   and I love training out of doors.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.980]   I love running.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:05.800]   I love lifting weights.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.840]   I love all sorts of physical training.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.840]   I know many people do.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.360]   I know many people don't.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.080]   But if one looks at Zone 2 Cardio
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.160]   as just part of their daily life,
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.800]   you're far more likely to get that Zone 2 Cardio in
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.400]   and all the benefits that come with it.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.560]   And you're also opening up time for work,
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.340]   for social engagements,
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.560]   and to do and pay attention to other aspects of fitness.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
