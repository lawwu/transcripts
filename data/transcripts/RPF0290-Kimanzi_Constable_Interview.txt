[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we're going to talk about how to stop chasing influencers
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.200]   and how to become one.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.480]   My guest is Kamonzi Constable.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.720]   He used to deliver bread for a living.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:21.860]   Now he travels the world and gets paid thousands of dollars to encourage, teach, motivate,
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.200]   and inspire others.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:42.240]   Today, sit back, relax, and let him inspire you.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.240]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.020]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.360]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.080]   This is the show where we talk about how to live a rich life now and how to build a plan
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.600]   for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.440]   My guest today has done exactly that.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.480]   He started off exactly like I said, delivering bread, paid his dues, worked his tail off,
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:14.400]   and is enjoying a degree of financial freedom that most people would dream of today.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.400]   My guest is Kamonzi Constable.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.600]   I met him at, what was it, podcast movement and saw his table of books and started talking
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.520]   to him and then he just turned out to have a really remarkable story.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.800]   When I connected with him, I was just very impressed by his story and really enjoyed
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.240]   getting to know him.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.480]   You'll hear in the interview, I've learned a lot from Kamonzi.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.480]   He's really a great guy.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.480]   I think you're going to enjoy this.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.120]   Before I play the interview for you, I want to share with you our sponsor of today's show.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.680]   Sponsor of the day today is Trade King.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.760]   Trade King is the official brokerage provider of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.960]   I reached out to Trade King after connecting with them at a conference.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.960]   I was really impressed by them.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.600]   I was looking for sponsors for the show and I said, "Hey, listen.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.240]   You guys are a company that's rooted in values, big enough to provide all of the services
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:08.240]   and all of the things that your customers need to produce an effective trading platform,
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.840]   but you're small enough to where I can actually talk to you."
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.600]   I did my homework, did my due diligence, reached out to all the different traders that I know
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.280]   before bringing them on the show and just asked them, "Hey, do you know of any bad
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.280]   press?"
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.280]   All the press was good.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.000]   I drove down to Fort Lauderdale, checked them out.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.040]   If you would like to open a trading account this year, Trade King is the company for you

[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.760]   Kamonzi, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.760]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.040]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.520]   I'm a big fan of the show ever since I heard your longer critique of Tony Robbins' book.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.680]   I remember that.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.320]   We met at Podcast Movement 2015 and I had never known you or your name or your work
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.560]   and you had a table there with your books and I was recording interviews at a table
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.880]   I had, let's just say stolen, next door to you to do interviews for the show.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.800]   We got to talking and you asked me what I thought of Tony Robbins.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.120]   I sent you my three-hour intro to him and to the book and I appreciate you checking
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.120]   it out.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.400]   It's hard for me to answer questions of, "Hey, what do you think about the book?"
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   in about 10 seconds.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.240]   So it's nice to be able to send people a podcast interview.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.720]   Yeah, that was good.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.080]   So I've been excited about bringing you on because since we met, I went back and read
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.760]   your books and went through two of your books anyway and I went through and just started
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.240]   watching you and watching your work and I have been seriously impressed by your story
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.120]   and I've been excited to bring you to my audience.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.480]   So let's kick it off with, would you be willing to share a little bit of your background and
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.440]   especially your background in business, where you came from and the type of work that you
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.440]   do now?
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.960]   Yeah, at 19 years old, I had the opportunity to become an entrepreneur.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.480]   I had worked for Sarah Lee Bakery delivering bread and every day I would see this guy delivering
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.000]   bread who wasn't wearing a uniform.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.520]   So I asked this guy one day, I'm like, "How come you guys don't have to wear uniforms?"
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.880]   And he said that he was an independent contractor and I'd never heard of that.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.000]   I didn't have any entrepreneurial people in my family, so I didn't know what that was,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.960]   but he kind of broke it down for me what it was.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.840]   He was a franchise owner for this bread company.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.120]   They gave him 20% but he was responsible for all his own stuff.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.840]   And out of that conversation, he said one thing that piqued my interest.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.000]   He said, "The problem with being an independent contractor is you always have to have your
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.160]   route covered no matter what."
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.820]   And so there are some of us that have been doing this that haven't been on vacation in
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.840]   like seven years.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.360]   And I thought, "Well, it sucks not to go on vacation seven years," but I thought, "Hmm,
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.360]   that's interesting."
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.920]   And I asked him, I'm like, "Well, what would happen if you had a vacation guy?"
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.680]   And he said, "The vacation guy would have work all day long."
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.800]   So I said, "Hey, would you be willing to train me for free and get me set up in this?"
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   So that's what happened.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.200]   He started training me on their systems and all their stuff.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.720]   And I put out a schedule for the rest of that year saying that I was available to run vacation
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.600]   routes for these independent operators.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.360]   This was my business under my name and they would pay me directly.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.360]   And when I put that schedule out, it was filled up in a couple of days.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.160]   That schedule was full.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.760]   And at that point, I had enough confidence to say, "Look, I got a full schedule.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.120]   I got a little bit of money in the bank.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.160]   I'm going to go ahead and quit Sara Lee."
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.960]   And so that's what I did.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.880]   And that service business in the bread industry, it grew very fast.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.800]   I was full not only that year, which would have been, oh man, this was when I was 19
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.520]   years old, so this would have been like 2009-ish.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.520]   2008, 2009-ish.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:21.760]   And the schedule filled up very quickly that year and the whole following year to the point
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.300]   where I said I had to bring somebody else on.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.280]   So six years into this business, just to cut this story short, I had a business that did
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.200]   vacation routes for these independent guys in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.160]   I had five guys working for me doing this as well, and the business was bringing in
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.280]   half a million dollars a year.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.880]   The problem was that because I didn't know anything about business, I didn't read any
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.520]   books or anything like that, I completely mismanaged the finances.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.880]   So money would come in and-
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.880]   You did that too, huh?
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.600]   It's strange how we have to go through this difficult road sometimes.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.960]   Well, that first year when I got to the end of the year and I had a good year, made something
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.400]   like $100,000, and then I got that tax bill.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.160]   I didn't pay quarter lease throughout the year.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.760]   I didn't know anything about that.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.840]   And I got that bill for like, I don't know, $20,000, $30,000, just some crazy amount of
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.840]   money.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.320]   And I'm like, "Who's supposed to pay this?
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.360]   Who's supposed to pay this?"
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.640]   And that's pretty much what happened for six years is I would get the bills and I wouldn't
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.640]   pay them.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.600]   I would file my taxes, of course, and all that.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.360]   But I didn't have the money to pay them because I blew all the money throughout the year.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.120]   And so 12 years into this business, 12 years in this business, it'd be 2011.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.640]   I was $180,000 in debt from the business.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.400]   I was down to just me.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.920]   I got rid of all the employees.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.040]   I realized that having employees was something that I never wanted and will never ever in
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.440]   my life ever repeat.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.040]   It's just not for me.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.640]   So it was just me at this point.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.240]   I had all this debt.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.520]   I was overweight because working at this job, I was always in the business.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.400]   I never managed a business, meaning I always had to be on the bread truck.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:21.160]   So I was always eating Taco Bell and McDonald's and blah, blah, blah at midnight.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.480]   And so it led to weight gain.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.720]   I was 170 pounds heavier than I am now.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:32.280]   And life was falling apart because once the finances were messed up and we were stressing
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.920]   about money and we couldn't even open a bank account in our name because the IRS was coming
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.100]   to take all the money in them, it led to a lot of problems in my marriage.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.680]   Money problems usually equal marriage problems.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.160]   And so there was a lot of problems there.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.880]   And that year I just sat on the ground, Joshua, and I was just crying.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:09:00.520]   I sat on the living room floor, I can remember, of my friend's couch and some commercial came
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.960]   on for, it could have been like dentures, but it was like a happy family and they were
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.240]   smiling and blah, blah, blah.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.160]   And I'm like, "That used to be my family and I just lost it.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.280]   I broke down at that point."
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:18.080]   And after a good cry, I got back up and I realized that if something was going to change,
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.120]   I had to be the one to do it.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.840]   This isn't a movie.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.300]   I wasn't going to win the lottery.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.240]   There wasn't going to be some magical thing that happened.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.240]   If there was going to be change, I had to get off my butt and I had to make that change
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.240]   happen.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.320]   And so that's what I did.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.960]   The first thing I did was I journaled everything that was going on because I just had to get
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.920]   this stuff out of my head.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.040]   And when I looked down on this journal after a couple of months of journaling, I had filled
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.240]   like this little 90 page notebook.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.080]   I'd filled this thing all the way up with everything that had just come out.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:59.560]   And at that point, it was end of 2011, self-publishing was becoming a thing that I had been hearing
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.240]   about more and more in the news.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.400]   And I thought, "Man, maybe I could take this journal and self-publish a book."
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.400]   And so that's what I did.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.480]   I paid some professionals, paid to have a website done, paid to have the book put out
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.480]   there.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.880]   But the problem was I had no audience, Joshua.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.880]   Nobody was listening.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.840]   Nobody even knew that I was alive.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.360]   So I put this book out there and in the first six months, it sold five copies in the first
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.720]   six months.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.960]   And it was pretty depressing.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.760]   But by that point, I was determined that I was not going to give up.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:37.720]   So I spent 2012 learning how to build an audience, how to connect with people.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.880]   And what I did that year, to make a long story short, was I just went out there and I tried
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.600]   to get massive exposure.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.880]   I guest posted for 80 different blogs that year.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.880]   I was a guest on 60 different podcasts that year.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.320]   Wherever I could get exposure, I was out there filling out horror requests.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.280]   I was kind of all over the place just to really try to build my audience.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.560]   And the result was by the end of that year, I had, by the end of 2012, I had sold something
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.120]   like 40,000 books.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.400]   I had some coaching clients.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.320]   I had a few opportunities to come speak at different conferences and they weren't paying
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.400]   a lot but they paid a couple bucks here and there.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.040]   And so the money at that point was good.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.720]   We used most of that book money.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.960]   The money that came in from royalties from books all went to pay down that debt.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.000]   It wasn't paid off by the end of 2012 but we paid off a good chunk of that.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.600]   And I felt confident at that point with a business that was consistently bringing in
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:47.800]   $5,000 a year, I felt confident that I could, a month, sorry, $5,000 a month, I felt confident
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.080]   that I could go ahead and quit the day job and build upon this thing.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:12:00.640]   So 2013, 2014 were years where I just continued to get the exposure, continued to go after
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.880]   it, I started proactively seeking out opportunities and the business just, it built and it's continued
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.440]   to build until today.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:18.560]   We moved our family from Maui, Hawaii, from Milwaukee, Wisconsin in April of 2014.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:24.040]   We paid off all the debt with the money from the book sales and other monies and now I
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.800]   operate a business that allows me to do some traveling and speaking.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.480]   I'm the author now of four books which is pretty cool.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:38.240]   I work with the full schedule coaching clients and do some consulting and life is drastically
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.720]   different than it was back then, Joshua.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.240]   So you obviously got lucky because you're an overnight success.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.320]   So you got a lucky break.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.080]   What was the lucky break, Kamonze, that just opened all the doors to the floodgates for
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.880]   you that, what was that one lucky break that completely did it for you?
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.880]   It was Oprah.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.880]   Oprah.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.880]   Oprah.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.880]   Oprah changed your life.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.880]   She tweeted about my website.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.880]   That's a lie.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.880]   Don't take that seriously.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.880]   Sarcasm heavily implied there.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:15.320]   And that was why I wanted to bring you on because I get so sick and tired of being involved
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:21.520]   in this building an entrepreneurial endeavor of my own and having consumed a lot of advice
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.920]   of other people, watching people with web businesses.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.520]   I get sick and tired of the lies that people tell.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.560]   And as I've built Radical Personal Finance over the last year and a half, it has been
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.320]   probably one of the much more difficult things I've ever done.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.280]   And people look and often say, "Well, look, Joshua, it's easy.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.120]   You got all these listeners and the show has been so good.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.440]   And look, you've got this great Patreon campaign."
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.840]   I was like, "Do you understand the amount of work behind it?"
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:54.760]   And so I really appreciate it when people do a good job of identifying the great things
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.400]   about this type of business but also the challenges.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.480]   And I have a lot of respect for people who balance those things and I believe you do
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.160]   that very well.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.760]   Thank you.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.600]   Question I want to ask though about your story.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:16.640]   So you are really good at sharing some ideas, sharing tips and sharing things like that.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:23.120]   But your background that you often say in your bio is you talk about, "Well, I'm
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.280]   a bread delivery guy."
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:32.240]   And in my mind, that immediately puts an image of you driving around in a truck and it's
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.800]   like, "What does the bread delivery guy had to offer?"
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:40.360]   And if you juxtapose that with the fact that here you are writing about success, writing
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.120]   about things that entrepreneurs should do and sharing all these great wins, getting
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.600]   paid 20,000 bucks to come and give a speech for a day and traveling all over the world
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.320]   in first class as you've shared some of your experiences, at least for me, it makes
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.480]   me think, "What on earth does this guy, he's a bread guy, have to offer?"
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.880]   And I'm interested to know what gives you the right as a bread delivery guy to give
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.080]   other people advice about their life and business?
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.960]   Well, life experience.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:20.600]   I'm definitely not sharing anything like advanced SEO strategies or even maybe some
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.800]   of the stuff you talked about in the Tony Robbins book on finances or this, that.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.160]   I'm only sharing what I've experienced in my life and my journey.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.400]   And so I can speak about my experiences with authority because I lived them.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.080]   I didn't get that lucky break.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.360]   I didn't get that tweet from Oprah.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.760]   I had to hustle.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.720]   My very first speaking gig, I still have a picture of it.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:53.440]   I got a check for $125 to come and speak.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.040]   So it wasn't a lot, but you know what?
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.080]   It was a lot to me back then.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:05.800]   And then since then, since that first $125, I've spoken over 60 times.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.880]   It took 60 times before I got that gig that eventually did pay $10,000.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:18.760]   So when I share that, I've done a lot to get to that point where I got the bigger dollar
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.760]   gigs.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:26.640]   So for me, I have the authority to speak about these things because all I'm sharing is what
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.800]   I've gone through, my experiences, how I've overcome them and anybody else who is in the
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.920]   position that I was in.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.040]   So me, my audience is going to be the everyday working man and woman.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.840]   If you come to my website, that's what you're going to see.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:49.360]   It says so that everyday work in person, how they can create a life of freedom for themselves.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.320]   So that's what I focus on.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.880]   I focus on the experience and I believe I can speak with the authority because I've
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.880]   lived it.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.960]   This isn't just, I didn't leave some six figure corporate job, pay a bunch of money to hire
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:07.520]   some of the top coaches and get all the strategies and buy all the Facebook ads and all that.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.000]   I built this thing living less than paycheck to paycheck.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Tyler Litchenberger Yeah.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.480]   If the tone of that question sounded sharp to a listener, I intended it to sound sharp
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.160]   and perhaps it came across as unfriendly.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.040]   But the reason was I wanted to develop this theme during the course of our interview because
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:29.320]   I feel that this is one of the major things that holds many of us back and I've struggled
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.320]   with it.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.000]   I can imagine that you've struggled with it.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.080]   You probably have not always just brimmed with confidence in the things you had to share.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.360]   In many ways, we often look to external sources for validation.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.520]   Many people, I get so tired of it sometimes when I was working as a personal financial
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.360]   advisor and people would say, "Well, I want to do this so I'm going to go back to school."
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.160]   I would say, "Well, why do you want to go back to school?"
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.080]   "Well, because I need that certification."
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.640]   Well, certifications have their place.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.920]   School has its place.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:00.840]   But the reality is in many ways, life is waiting for you to write your own ticket.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:07.400]   You can sit around and just wait and wait and wait for other people to approve you or
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.560]   you can get busy and start the hustle, start working.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:16.160]   Over time, let the marketplace approve you.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.880]   After meeting you and looking at your books and looking at your blog and all that, I found
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.560]   that part of your story super inspirational.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.880]   Did that come easily to you as far as the idea of, "I'm just going to start"?
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.880]   Did you struggle with that?
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.880]   What was your background on that topic?
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.560]   It's always been – I had a post go live on my blog today called, "Four Ways to Beat
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.120]   Imposter Syndrome."
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:46.040]   I can remember when I self-published my first book, there was some attention but there wasn't
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.040]   a lot of attention.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.720]   When I put the second book out there after I built an audience, the very first review
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:57.800]   I have on that book and it's still on Amazon is this long tirade from somebody that was
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.120]   actually on my book launch team, by the way, Joshua.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.760]   They said, "This guy is…"
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.760]   Enemies within the camp.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.000]   They said, "This guy is an imposter.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.640]   This guy can't – I don't know what authority he has to speak to us.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.600]   He hasn't even done any of the things that he's writing about in the book."
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.960]   They're right because I wrote about moving to Hawaii.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.480]   I wrote about losing weight.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.360]   I wrote about paying off debt.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.840]   I had this book and I hadn't even done those things but I had tried to make it clear in
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:31.240]   the book that this is the journey that I'm on and I want you to come on with this journey
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.240]   with me.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.280]   Now, today I have done all those things but back then I didn't.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.800]   So for me, I had to get to the point where I realized that I'm not doing this and I'm
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:46.440]   not writing this and I'm not in this journey to prove myself to that person, that person
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:51.120]   that left that review or anybody that thinks that like that person.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.280]   I'm in this journey to help people, to help the everyday working man, to help the person
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.880]   that feels like they're stuck.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:04.600]   So if I'm going to do that, I have to focus on creating value and content and being there
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.640]   for that person.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:11.840]   I can't focus on myself and my feelings and my feelings of being an imposter.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.120]   I just have to keep my eyes on the prize and I have to keep going.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.080]   Those who this is meant for are going to get it.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.160]   They're going to appreciate it.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.240]   Those who are not, they're not part of my tribe anyways.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.880]   So peace out.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.880]   You do you.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:32.320]   I just had to shift my focus from me to them and then I had to do everything I can to A,
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.280]   learn about this kind of stuff.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.720]   So do the research and then B, be a man of action.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:45.000]   And the amazing thing is that if you apply yourself to education and action, you can
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.800]   transform and become someone who's able to deliver an amazing amount of value.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   And there's no gatekeeper.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.680]   In today's world, you don't have to impress the gatekeeper.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.240]   You just got to simply create the message and share it and start helping people and
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.840]   over time, you can reach the right people.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.560]   And I want to thank you for the work that you've done.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.160]   Since I met you, I've watched your information and I've admired and in some ways modeled
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.960]   a lot of what you've done because I've appreciated the very authentic tone that you take when
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.040]   you speak with things even as I've watched your social media, the way that you interact
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:24.280]   with your friends and readers on social media and different things like that.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.280]   I've watched that and I've really admired it and I've modeled some of it and it's been
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:32.440]   really helpful to me because I've often struggled with maintaining the glittering facade.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.240]   We're often taught don't look weak, don't share how things are.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:40.760]   But yet, I was attracted to your message because you shared the difficult things and I found
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.120]   it much more accessible than a lot of people.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.560]   I want to be able to encourage other people in an accessible way.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:51.240]   I don't want to be the type of person who stands up on the hill and says, "Look at me.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.920]   I've got it all together," because that's not me.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.840]   So just a public thank you to you for the work that you've done.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.600]   So if it's not helped anybody else, it's certainly helped me in watching you.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.480]   So thank you for that work.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.760]   One of the themes that I explore a lot on Radical Personal Finance is how people can
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:16.640]   build their brand and build their own income by building their own brand.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.980]   You are an expert at building and leveraging authority and influence in different areas
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.240]   of life.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.480]   If you were giving advice to somebody who's sitting down and kind of looking and saying,
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:33.720]   "I need to start to build my brand, build my authority in the marketplace," how would
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:38.560]   you encourage that person to build a plan and what would you encourage them to do in
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.920]   order to enhance their career, which can ultimately enhance their income?
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:49.000]   So this is not going to be a surprise to Joshua because he's read my books, but I would tell
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.260]   you not to build it in the places that we're typically taught.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:23:00.240]   I would tell you to go after the larger exposure, the more exposure.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:06.360]   What I mean by that is all of the places that have name recognition for people.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.960]   So we're taught that one way to do it is to connect with an influencer.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.520]   So that's why we had joked about the Oprah tweet.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.080]   We're told that if we can connect with an influencer, add value to them somehow.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.760]   I think we've all heard the story of somebody who saw a widget that was missing on somebody's
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:30.200]   website and this person pointed it out and became big, best friends with this influencer.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   They got the shout out and they became famous, right?
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.680]   It's like the Cinderella story.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.600]   But that is the exception.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.080]   That's not the rule.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.800]   And so like building influencers or going to like what's new and hot.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.920]   So no offense to anybody who's blabbing or periscoping or stuff like that, but that's
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.040]   the new and hot thing.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.920]   That's where you're told you should be.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.000]   You should connect with your audience.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.480]   All that kind of stuff is great, but day in and day out, that's not the best place to
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.480]   build.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.000]   You want to go where the people are.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.360]   So like large publications such as like the Huffington Post and Entrepreneur Magazine
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:13.720]   and Forbes and Inc and all these places that literally get millions of captive readers
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:20.800]   every day, every month, you have the opportunity to get exposure in these places and get exposure
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.480]   to these millions of people.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.080]   And the cool thing is, is most of the people, most of the advice that we see like in the
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:32.680]   quote unquote online/lifestyle entrepreneurship space, they're all building in the same places.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.440]   They're all going after the same audience.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.440]   And that audience is being converted and capitalized by the people that are on the top of the food
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.740]   chain by the influencers.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.680]   So when you're just starting out, you're trying to get the same people that the big names
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.680]   are going after.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.720]   So instead of chasing being in that pond, think a little bit outside of that pond and
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.840]   go to these larger media publications which anybody listening to this can totally get
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:05.280]   exposure on, get that exposure there and build a brand that's outside of this space.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.040]   It's an untapped field.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.160]   All the things that we would take for granted, all the knowledge that we have in this space,
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:17.240]   it's new and it's untapped in more of the mainstream space.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.080]   In my mind, that's one of the keys just is visibility.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.800]   There's a balance for people in terms of what they can do and what they should be doing
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:31.440]   that you can be doing great work but if nobody knows about your great work, it's not benefiting
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.760]   you as much as it could be.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:39.440]   No matter where you are, whether you're building an online business, whether you're an employee
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:45.560]   of a company or whether you're in a brick and mortar traditional brick and mortar business,
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.000]   you've got to take charge of your brand.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.120]   You've got to take charge of your image, your persona and you've got to take charge of going
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.960]   out and sharing that with people.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:01.320]   That's what separates those who are continually influenced by the latest economic changes
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:07.440]   from those who are able to, to mix metaphors here, who are able to surf the waves no matter
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.680]   when they get big and turbulent because it's that skill and they can slide right through.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:19.560]   Your expertise in the area of writing and sharing that with people is valuable.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.640]   Do you come- - Yeah, because at the end of the day, if
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:29.880]   you don't have an audience or you don't have customers, you're not going to make any money.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.480]   - With regard to your entrepreneurial journey, many people struggle to figure out how can
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.760]   I work and earn a job, keep my job and take care of my family and do all these things
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.640]   and you've been through that journey.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.480]   You had kids when you were working the job and then you're trying to build your business
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.000]   on the side.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.600]   What was that period of your life like and do you have any advice for people who feel
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.800]   like they're stuck in the crunch?
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.640]   - Yeah, for me, it wasn't good.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:01.520]   I'll tell you right now, I did not keep a proper balance.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.040]   I was obsessed with leaving the job that I hated, leaving this business.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.600]   I was obsessed with getting out of it.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:14.400]   For me, I would work 60 to 80 hours a week in this business.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.880]   I would get home and then I would work another crazy amount of hours, two, three hours a
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:24.340]   day writing, doing podcast interviews, doing anything I could to get that exposure and
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.320]   also promoting my stuff.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:31.000]   Yeah, there was a lot of time that should have been spent with family, should have had
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.360]   the proper balance that wasn't.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.280]   I'll be the first to admit that.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.720]   If I were to give advice looking back on it now and from just what I've seen now with
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:47.160]   people that I've worked with and stuff like that, it's a matter of finding time where
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:52.960]   you can get some things done but you're not sacrificing that time with your family because
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.840]   that is important.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.840]   Life is short.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.420]   We don't know how much time we have.
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:02.480]   All of us are guaranteed one thing and that's we're guaranteed to die.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.840]   That's the one thing we're all guaranteed and we don't know when that is.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.680]   That time with your family is greatly important.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.120]   If that means waking up a little early, if that means staying up a little later, if that
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:19.440]   means working on something at your lunch break at work but just finding let's say an hour
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.440]   a day.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:25.080]   If you found an hour a day to work on your thing and build it on your side five hours
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.240]   a week, maybe add a little bit of extra time on the weekend.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.520]   If you're using that time wisely, how you're using that time is the most important thing.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.480]   It's not actually the amount of time.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.320]   But if you're using that time wisely, you can build this thing on the side and you can
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.120]   do it in a reasonable amount of time.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:47.440]   You've written in your published work that there was a shift that happened.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:52.040]   And again, your newest book, or your second to newest book, Stop Chasing Influencers,
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.360]   where you talk about, "Okay, we chase big people but then I just switched and said,
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.640]   I've got to build it myself."
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:01.800]   And you specifically talked about learning how to build your own social media presence.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.320]   What was the transition that you faced where you went from selling four copies of your
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.400]   book to selling 40,000?
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.900]   And what did you do differently with regard to social media to be able to engage with
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.920]   your readers such that they bought your books?
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:23.280]   Yeah, it was for me and self-publishing, I did this in 2011, 2012, which everybody says,
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.680]   "Well, how do you do that now?"
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:29.720]   It's a little bit different ballgame because back then there was something like 300,000
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.040]   books on Amazon in the Kindle store.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.000]   Now there's like 4 million books in the Kindle store.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.480]   So there was far less competition back then.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:43.220]   Back then also there was more reach on social media.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:48.240]   So back then Facebook wasn't a publicly traded company or they were just becoming one, but
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.920]   they didn't limit the amount of research you have or they didn't limit as severely as they
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.220]   do today.
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.460]   So you had more reach organically on social media.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.840]   So it was just kind of a number of factors.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:05.760]   But I think the biggest thing was shifting the focus to I have to promote this thing
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.700]   to let me add value first.
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:13.720]   So instead of posting links to my book and stuff like that and heading people up all
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:19.080]   the time and coming on strong, what I did was I focused on coming on strong with the
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.160]   content.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.800]   So whether it was a blog post that I wrote related to the book or a video I made or some
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:29.440]   form of content, I would give them the content, that's what I would post, and then in that
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.320]   content I would reference the book.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:37.140]   So I've shifted the focus where it's not promotional, this is I'm adding value, and if you want
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.080]   even more value you can buy the book.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.260]   And that to me was kind of the game changer when I came from that perspective because
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.440]   when people felt like they got the value, they would not only buy the book but buy other
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.320]   things that I was selling.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:55.160]   Here's a follow on to that with a question that I personally struggle with so I'm going
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:59.760]   to take advantage of you with some free coaching here.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.360]   Thinking about the amount of time that you should spend creating versus the amount of
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:10.240]   time promoting, I have wanted to, so I built Radical Personal Finance exclusively on creating.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.760]   I did no marketing, I did nothing.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.280]   My theory was that if I create good stuff, the internet should work.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.720]   And my only marketing has been satisfied listeners telling other people about the show.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.240]   And that worked extremely well for the first year.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.280]   After about a year I've started to feel more comfortable with what I was doing.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.760]   I felt like I'd made a lot of progress as a broadcaster to be able to create better
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:37.240]   content and I felt like I could afford to shift my focus over and do more marketing.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:42.800]   And so I've intended to do more writing, write more guest posts, share with more, write for
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.640]   large publications, etc. like you teach.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.880]   But what I've found is that that aspect is very difficult for me.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:56.760]   Writing is very difficult for me and it doesn't come as smoothly and as well as creating good
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.200]   content.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.960]   And my content has suffered due to the desire to be over there marketing.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:08.440]   How would you think through the business problem of should I just continue what worked in the
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.160]   beginning and continue creating much more valuable content that people are going to
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.720]   find useful and share with one another and reference because I've got plenty of that
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.560]   that I could create or should I focus on marketing the content that I'm already creating even
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.160]   to the point where it makes my content suffer?
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.320]   How would you think through that problem?
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.680]   I would stick with your strong suit.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:32.240]   So if writing, writing is going to be difficult for a lot of people.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:37.640]   You can either A, you can use like a speak to text program, you know, dragon dictator
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:43.400]   or something like that where you're not actually sitting out and writing the articles, but
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:49.520]   you're speaking the articles because what writing is at its core is your ability to
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.240]   express, express a thought.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.320]   The thought is what people are going to connect with, not the actual words.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.440]   They want to know, you know, what is this about?
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.680]   What's that thought?
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.280]   So you can use a program like, like dragon dictator.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:07.720]   And I know authors that I've written, I know an author who wrote 17 books and he did it
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.360]   all through dictation.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.840]   He didn't actually sit down and write any of it.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.240]   So that's a possibility today.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.400]   But more than that, the thing that I love about some large publications and the reason
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:25.560]   why I talk about it so much is because large publications today, they want to be with the
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.560]   times.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:33.280]   They want to be very, they want to be, they want to be multimedia.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   They really want multimedia content is what they're looking for.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:43.120]   So not only do you have the written word, but like entrepreneur magazine, for example,
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.960]   they have bloggers or bloggers do video posts and that's become really popular over there.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.280]   Several people that I know, several clients, several people that I just connected with
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:59.320]   are now vloggers for entrepreneur magazine where they're on there making videos for entrepreneur.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:04.000]   Several of my podcaster friends are on the Huffington post and what they'll do is pretty
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.440]   much what they'll post is their show notes.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:11.320]   They'll post a good title for the article, their show notes, and then they'll embed the,
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:15.920]   the whatever SoundCloud, Libsyn, whatever it is that you're using, they'll embed that
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.180]   in the post.
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:22.880]   So you have written content, you have podcasts, you have videos, it's all multimedia content
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.640]   and that's what these publications are looking for.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.560]   They want to mix it up so you don't have to write.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.080]   You can put your podcasts on there.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.360]   So like if I was to advise you, that's what I would tell you to do is I would tell you
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:39.140]   to get into some of these places and start posting your podcast episodes over there.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:44.360]   And that's a whole nother, you get, if you look at somebody like a Lewis house, go to
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.960]   entrepreneur magazine, look up Lewis house and look at all the articles he's posted.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.960]   It's all his podcast episodes.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:56.840]   It's just his show notes with the SoundCloud feed and he's getting his podcasts exposed
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.920]   to millions of people and his numbers are crazy because of it.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.720]   So that, that's what I would tell you is I'd focus on your strength.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.840]   If you're a podcaster, get your podcast exposure.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:12.080]   If you're a vlogger, go ahead and start making some videos for these places and there's a,
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.080]   there's a lot of opportunity.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.600]   You wrote a book called, are you living or existing?
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:24.280]   And in many ways the, the, you know, the, the blurb as far as your author profile is
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.280]   very compelling.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:29.600]   You know, bread guy in Milwaukee, Wisconsin goes from delivering bread for a living to
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:35.760]   moving his family to Hawaii, losing 170 pounds and paying off $180,000 in debt.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.920]   It's a very compelling, succinct description.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.680]   But I have many listeners who write to me a lot of times and say, well, I just not sure
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.680]   what I want to do.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.640]   And I know I'm not fully satisfied.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.800]   I know I'm just existing, but I'm not sure what to do.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.640]   How would you talk through somebody, a process of transition and identifying how they should
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.840]   create a plan to go from existing to living?
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.600]   Yeah, that is not an easy one.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.080]   I know a lot of people that do struggle with that.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.640]   Um, it's, and there's no easy answer for that.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:15.320]   What I would tell you is you have to take some time, maybe talk it over with family
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:20.080]   or friends or a mastermind group, but really take some time and think about what, what
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.000]   do you want from your life?
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.240]   What is it that you enjoy doing?
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.240]   What are you passionate about?
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:32.020]   I've heard a lot of people say that passion is overrated and they've, they've taken shots
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.520]   at passion.
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:38.420]   And I, I sure think that, yeah, there's, there is a lot of garbage out there about passion,
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:42.080]   but at the end of the day, like if I told you, Joshua, you were coaching client, I told
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.280]   you, um, you have to write for these publications.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.360]   You could do it and you could probably do it for a month, but if writing is not something
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.560]   you're not passionate about, guess what?
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:56.320]   It's going to be like pulling teeth and you're not going to do it and you're not going to
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.040]   continue doing it.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:03.320]   So if you don't have a passion for something, you can try it and maybe even experience success,
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.760]   but that's only going to be for a little while.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.760]   That's why, that's why passion is important.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.540]   So what, what are you passionate about?
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.180]   What gets you excited?
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.620]   What could you see yourself doing?
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.400]   What did you always want to do when you were a kid?
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:21.820]   Like really tap into what it is that you want to do with your life because truly living
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.020]   doesn't mean you're traveling the world to speak.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.420]   It doesn't mean you're bungee jumping.
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:28.940]   It doesn't mean you're running with the bulls in Spain.
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:33.080]   It means that you're living what living means to you.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.900]   So for all of us, each of us, that's going to be different.
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.960]   Josh, you know, has the Joshua has a radical personal finance.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.880]   I'd write and speak.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.680]   Somebody else might want to like a client that I helped.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.200]   He wanted a job in construction.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.840]   He wanted to be a construction manager.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.560]   He got the job and he's living life and he's loving it.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.400]   You know, that's what truly living is to him.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.320]   So each of us, it's going to be different.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:59.160]   There's no cookie cutter answer, but it's up to you to sit down, take some time, figure
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.640]   out what are you passionate about?
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.560]   What is it that you always want to do?
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.120]   And it might take a few tries.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.760]   When I started out in this journey to leave bread, I didn't start out with writing.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:15.440]   The very first thing that I did was I thought that I wanted to be an event planner and I
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:21.680]   had seen some TV show somewhere where an event planner was bossing people around and they
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.680]   seem very important.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.280]   I thought that's what I want to do.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:29.640]   I even had, I had business cards made for this Joshua and I got the Bluetooth and I
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.760]   got the clipboard and I actually had the signal of power.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:43.520]   You need the Bluetooth, the clipboard and you got to be able to boss people around.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:47.680]   And right away, like a month after I told everybody, family and friends is going to
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.960]   be event planner.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:54.080]   My stepsister asked me to plan her wedding, like seriously asked me, like hired me to
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.040]   plan her wedding.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.560]   And I thought, okay, I'm going to get a chance to put this to the test.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.920]   So one week into the wedding, it was a disaster.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.440]   None of the family members were listening to me.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.080]   Nobody was listening to what I was saying.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.600]   Two weeks in the wedding, I had vendors like, is this guy an idiot?
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.560]   Like what is this guy doing?
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.440]   And like three weeks into it, my family was ready to disown me.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.640]   And that experience, not because I failed at it, but just going through the experience
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:26.360]   and seeing what you have to deal with with event planning showed me that, hey, this isn't
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.080]   the thing for me.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.520]   And it really wasn't.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:35.640]   So it might take you a few tries at something to figure it out, but getting out there and
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.840]   testing and figuring it out for yourself, that's what's important.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.520]   So I know you got the book coming out.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.200]   I got a review copy, which is very exciting.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:49.720]   It was kind of fun to buy a review copy of Podcast Movement, Stop Chasing Influencers.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.800]   So it's coming out soon here.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:57.280]   Last question here, share with us the theme of the book, some of the major lessons learned
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:03.000]   from it so that my listeners can have a little bit more information about it and can go and
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.320]   check it out if it's right for them.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:09.960]   Yeah, I think the most important thing is just this idea of, it's not to say you'll
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:14.120]   never have heroes because each of us has heroes.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.880]   Dan Miller's a hero of mine.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.720]   If he called and wanted to talk to me, I'd be a fanboy and I'd be like, "Oh, it's Dan
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.720]   Miller."
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.840]   So it's not to say that you can't have heroes.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:29.200]   It just says don't chase when you could be using that time to build.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:33.680]   And then the second half of that book is all strategies on how, if you want to build a
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:40.400]   "online/lifestyle business," something that allows you freedom of location, freedom of
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:44.380]   time, it allows you flexibility, it lays out how you can do that.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.560]   So we talked about large publications.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.920]   It breaks that down.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.520]   How to build a successful podcast.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.160]   Jared Easley is the co-author of that book.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:57.920]   He's the co-founder of the conference that Josh and I met called Podcast Movement, where
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:01.600]   it was the first time I ever went, Josh, when I thought that conference was absolutely well
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.600]   done.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   It was.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.760]   I thought it was beautiful and it was amazing.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:10.240]   So Jared knows a little bit about podcasting, but things like getting on TV or getting paid
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.240]   consulting.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.280]   So if you want to build this kind of a business, it lays out the exact how-to strategy you
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.280]   can use.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:20.040]   But more than that, this overall message of don't chase.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.460]   You have everything you need to build.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.160]   Work on building on your own and here's a strategy.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.280]   That's what that message of this book is.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.400]   That's what Jared and I are passionate about.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:33.960]   And I don't think, Joshua, I'll ever write another book that's like that.
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:38.440]   I don't think I'll ever write another book about lifestyle entrepreneurship or anything
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.440]   like that.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.560]   So this is like a one-time deal for me.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:46.440]   But to be able to write it with one of my best friends, it was a very special experience.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.000]   And I'm a little biased.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.080]   But I thought the book came out really well.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.000]   Yeah, it's very good.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:59.480]   And it's refreshingly frank and it's refreshingly clear and it's refreshingly realistic.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.820]   But I think just even the title itself, I'll share my experience in building this type
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:08.160]   of business.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:15.660]   If you start to apply yourself to the work, that's what will ultimately grab the notice
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.720]   of the influencers.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.640]   And I've experienced it with Radical Personal Finance.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.840]   I had no name recognition.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.840]   Nobody knew me.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.840]   Nobody knew what I was doing.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:30.840]   I didn't have any brand.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.840]   And so I just simply started doing the work.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:39.360]   And even just in observing in our little niche industry, the personal finance online space
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:44.960]   and whatnot, in the beginning, I didn't go after anybody.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.240]   I just simply focused on doing the work and trying to create something useful.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:52.360]   What I've noticed is, number one, I've started to make a little bit of a transition of people
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.760]   looking up to me and reaching out to me, which is very flattering.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.080]   But it's become – it's harder to keep current with all of the requests.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:06.240]   And so in many ways, if people are looking to me for help, it's just simply I try to
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.240]   help as much as I can.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.160]   But in many ways, I can't do much because it's just name.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.480]   But as I've just simply focused on working, I have a lot of the leaders in the personal
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.840]   finance industry have admired the work that I've done and that has brought me to their
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.520]   attention without me ever having to chase them.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:26.780]   And so the whole idea of just simply do the work, don't chase the influencer, become
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:30.360]   the influencer, I think is a powerful idea.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.800]   You've got to ultimately have people who are – people who are ultimately going to
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.800]   help you out.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:41.200]   If nobody shared my show or a well-known guest didn't agree to come on, all those things
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.200]   help.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.840]   But at the end of the day, you can't control those things.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:47.880]   You can control what you actually do and I thought it was a brilliantly titled book if
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.880]   nothing else.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.720]   Ryan Neuhofeldt Yeah, and one thing that really stuck out
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:57.800]   to me and that I've seen as I built this is you think about influencers such as like
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.800]   let's say Dan Miller, Michael Hyatt, Dave Ramsey.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.620]   You think about those guys.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.160]   Those guys didn't start out where they were.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:09.840]   They started out from the beginning, humble beginnings, but they did it together.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.840]   They had a mastermind and they did it together.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.720]   They built this together.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:18.960]   That kind of connection where you reach out to people that are similar to you and that
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.520]   are on the same journey with you and you build that relationship and you help each other
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:27.680]   out and you're there for each other, that is a strong connection that you can take with
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.640]   you all the way to the top.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:33.600]   I've heard somebody call it like the third circle theory.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:39.400]   Instead of building up like the first tier – sorry, it's called the third tier theory.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.480]   Instead of building at the top tier, you're connecting with people on the second or third
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.880]   tier and you're just building this thing together.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.880]   I think that's a great way to build.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:53.360]   But would you – so do you think that even just the whole concept of mastermind is becoming
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.360]   a little bit overblown?
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:59.600]   In the sense that I've not found – I've not joined any paid masterminds or anything
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   like that.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:04.560]   There are a couple of people, a listener of the show and a couple of listeners of the
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.760]   show and a couple of friends who have for me have been instrumental.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:12.600]   But it wasn't – I didn't go out and buy some mastermind program to get a bunch of
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.880]   people to like my stuff.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.640]   Do you think even just the whole mastermind concept has become a little bit oversold these
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.640]   days?
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.640]   It depends on the mastermind.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.560]   Yeah, there's the paid ones.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.080]   Yeah, there's some question there about the paid ones.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.480]   I've never joined a paid one so I won't speak to that.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.440]   But if you get one where it's a good solid group of people, it's free, it's people
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.320]   that are doing what you're doing, you're all kind of on the same level, I think it
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.040]   could be so solid for you.
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:45.320]   My mastermind is the best friends that I had when I started building this.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.320]   My two friends are still in Wisconsin.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.920]   That's who my mastermind is.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.360]   We talk every day.
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.360]   We share things with each other.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.440]   We give each other ideas and that has been invaluable to me.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.880]   But it all depends on who the people are that are in there.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.880]   Awesome.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:04.420]   Kmanzi, K-I-M-A-N-Z-I, Konstable.com.
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:09.320]   Your blogs are there and let's see, the newest book is Stop Chasing Influencers.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.600]   Anywhere else you want people to be aware of your work or you just want to point them
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.600]   to your blog?
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.600]   Nope.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.600]   Go to the blog.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.600]   You'll see everything there.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.640]   Well, Kmanzi, keep doing what you're doing.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:18.960]   I appreciate your voice.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.040]   I appreciate the content and the information that you share.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:27.960]   It's been a help to me personally and I know to many other people and I wish you ever increasing
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.840]   and increasing amounts of success.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.080]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:40.920]   Today I urge you to please take the name and the meaning of the title of this book to heart.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.680]   Frankly, I wondered, I was like, "Do I need to do anything except just read the title
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.400]   of this book and have that be the whole show?"
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:51.840]   I decided to go ahead and play the interview for you because a 20-second podcast would
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:56.320]   be a little out of character for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.600]   But it really says it all.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.600]   Stop chasing influencers.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:05.520]   Here's my go-to thing is how can you stop chasing influencers and become one?
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:12.880]   Well, in order to do that, you've got to become a person who's worthy of influence.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.120]   Are you that person?
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:19.880]   That's not a trick question of like a Mr. Motivational Guru for you to say, "Yes, I'm
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.880]   that person.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.880]   Of course I am."
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.200]   No, you have to ask yourself, "Honestly, am I that person?"
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:27.280]   Because frankly, some of you are not and there's no reason trying to market something that
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.280]   you don't have.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.760]   There's no reason trying to market knowledge that you don't have.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.240]   You just wind up embarrassing yourself.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:37.320]   But you can become a person worthy of influence if you're not already.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.440]   Now if you are a person who's worthy of influence, if you're a person who's done your homework,
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.960]   who's studied, who's put in the hard work and the effort, who has something of value
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:49.240]   to share, then go ahead and start exercising that influence because it's never been easier
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:55.120]   than it is today to spread the message that you have that's uniquely yours.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:57.280]   I don't know how you're going to do it.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.280]   Start up a podcast.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.280]   I don't know.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.280]   Start a blog.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.280]   Go down and talk to people on the street.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:06.080]   However it works for you, get busy because we need people to do it.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.240]   So stop chasing influencers and become one.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.520]   You know the cool thing?
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:15.120]   If you do that, the influencers will chase you.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.120]   Proven it.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.120]   Believed it a few years ago.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.560]   I've proven it myself and you've heard the whole process.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.120]   That's it.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.740]   So thank you all for listening to the show today.
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:25.840]   Thank you for your support.
