[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.240]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.400]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.200]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.520]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to find all the
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.200]   hacks to optimize my life.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.880]   With housing being one of our largest expenses, I thought it would be amazing
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.480]   to do an episode about reducing your cost of living through house hacking,
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.880]   something I did for almost a decade that helped me save over $100,000.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.880]   And who better to have on than Andrew Kerr, a seasoned real estate investor and
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.600]   the founder of Financial Independence by Real Estate Investing, or FiByRia.com.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.720]   He's also worked for years in residential and small commercial banking, but most
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.880]   relevant to our conversation is that he's the host of the House Hacking Podcast.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.400]   In our conversation, we'll talk about the six different types of house hacks you
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.640]   can use to start saving money, roommate.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.600]   We'll also talk about some of his tips for buying and selling properties,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.280]   including in a hot market, and how to start thinking about real estate as
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.400]   a way to build your wealth.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.080]   It's going to be a great episode.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.000]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.560]   After I remind you.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.560]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.520]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.560]   and do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.280]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.720]   upon for investment decisions.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.360]   Andrew, thanks for being here.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.560]   Awesome, man.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.920]   Chris, I'm so excited.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.880]   We finally got the time to connect.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.800]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.760]   Yeah, I am excited.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.680]   And I just want to dive in really quick.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.400]   I don't know if everyone listening to this knows what house hacking is.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.680]   So I just want to start off by hearing you explain in your
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.000]   words, what house hacking is.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.680]   Awesome.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.840]   Yeah, I like the fact that you said my words, because it's sort of changed
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.160]   over the world and the way media has talked about house hacking, it's
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.320]   sometimes only talked about one way.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.960]   To me, house hacking is doing anything creative with your housing options
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.160]   to help reduce your housing costs.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.240]   You know, the average person spends 30% of their income on housing.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.920]   So if you can take a housing choice, pick how you're going to live to
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.920]   reduce any of that or all of that cost, to me, that is house hacking.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.080]   And whenever anyone says, you know, the goal is to cut all these costs, I feel
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.720]   like it often comes with a connotation of, you know, living in a crappy,
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.960]   rundown apartment, this isn't that though, right?
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.120]   So that is one option.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.800]   And that's where, you know, a lot of the articles that are online are doing
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.960]   roommates or room rental style house hacking, where it's the young person in
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.040]   their twenties that's getting and living in a big house and having four or five
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.720]   roommates.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.360]   And, you know, to me, that is definitely a big sacrifice.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.120]   I could never convince my wife to do that, but house hacking can be pretty
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.640]   luxurious, dependent on the style that you pick and where you're living.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.360]   So like me and my wife, we're in the Bywater here in New Orleans.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.840]   It's a historic district.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.280]   We're in a historic home that runs about $600,000 once we're finishing out our
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.720]   renovations, and we've got a tenant on the other side and we live in our side
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.560]   and they cover almost all of our housing costs.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.880]   So, you know, we're living in a amazing neighborhood.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.280]   We can walk to everything.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.680]   We rarely drive our car and it's just a beautiful building and it costs us
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.800]   almost nothing to live here.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.360]   So there's a lot of different ways to do house hacking, but most people prefer not
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.760]   that like dingy, dirty, a million roommate style of house hacking.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.680]   Yep. And these are, you said on the other side, are they in your sharing
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.760]   living space or is this completely separate?
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.840]   No. So this is what I'm doing is what we sort of call a small multifamily house
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.320]   hack. So it's where you buy a duplex, a triplex or a fourplex.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.960]   So, you know, in New Orleans, it was traditional where a family would buy a
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.320]   piece of land, build a building and make it into a two unit or a duplex.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.120]   So they've got their own entrance, own exit.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.080]   We even fenced off the backyard.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.640]   You know, we share a common wall all the way down the middle.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.400]   But outside of that, you know, we only see them if they're hanging out on the front
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.240]   porch and we're hanging out on the front porch.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.360]   Wow. And so that's one kind of house hacking.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.120]   The roommate style, you mentioned it, anyone could buy a place and get a bunch of
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.520]   roommates and charge rent.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.440]   Are there some other categories or is there a way you break it down?
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.520]   Yeah. So I sort of look at the six styles.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.640]   There's that room rental, the roommate style.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.600]   There's the small multifamily where you're buying the two unit, three unit or four
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.440]   unit. Then you've got the income suite.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.000]   So maybe you've got that walk up attic or that unfinished walk out
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.040]   basement and you convert that into an income suite.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.440]   So, you know, for folks that are maybe more in their 30s, they might remember a show.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.080]   I think it was like HDTV.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.640]   It was called Income Suite.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.880]   And that's all they did was take people's basement and convert it into an income
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.360]   suite. And that way there's no shared space.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.640]   The other way is called the ADU house hack.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.880]   So an ADU is a term for an accessory dwelling unit.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.200]   It's essentially an outbuilding on your land.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.360]   It's a sort of zoning or building code definition.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.120]   But that's where a lot of folks will, especially in California, where they've got
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.600]   that pool house, guest house or garage and convert it into an apartment.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.640]   And now you've got sort of your main building and a small building on the same lot.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.640]   Then the next is a work provided house hacking where you specifically choose a career
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.120]   path or if you want to change careers, pick a career path where housing is provided.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.760]   So that could be, you know, teaching abroad, careers in the military.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.680]   There's a lot of sort of upper level white collar jobs where they're going to post
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.320]   you somewhere for three months, six months, a year, and they'll provide corporate
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.400]   housing. And then the last option is a live in flip and a slow
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.000]   flip. So most folks are familiar with flipping a house.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.440]   You know, you go and you fix it up as quick as you can.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.800]   You sell it. But the idea with the slow flip is you live in it for at least a year,
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.320]   ideally two years.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.000]   That way, as you fix it up, it drastically appreciates in value.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.360]   And then when you go to sell it because you lived it in for two years, you don't have
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.240]   to pay taxes on any gain up to two hundred fifty thousand dollars if you're single
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.080]   or half a million if you're married.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.480]   So whereas a normal flipper, they'll flip a house and they could be paying 30, 40
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.520]   percent in taxes on that money they made on the flip.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.800]   So those are the sort of six main styles.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.360]   You can combine them and there's a lot of other things you can do.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.640]   But those are the sort of six ways.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.560]   And do they all require buying a property or is there any type of rental based house
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.120]   acting?
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.080]   Yeah. So that's actually a question I get a lot.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.640]   Folks will say, look, hey, I don't know what I can do yet.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.800]   My credit's not quite right.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.520]   I need to save money for a down payment.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:26.240]   Well, go rent a big house, get a big flat lease and put the lease in your name only.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.120]   And then you rent out the rooms to all your friends.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.200]   Or maybe you can find that house that does have that walkout basement and you can close
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.800]   it off and then separate it and put it on Airbnb or rent it out to travel nurses or
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.240]   put in a long term tenant.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.600]   Just the one thing you want to be careful of if you're renting a space is just look
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.080]   through the lease and make sure it's OK to sublease parts of the property or to do
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.080]   things like Airbnb in the portions of the property you're not using.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.240]   Have you found that if leases don't allow that, are landlords ever willing to
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.600]   negotiate here or if it's not allowed, kind of move on?
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   It depends on the landlord.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.240]   Now, here's the thing, being a landlord myself, and I know you've been one.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.240]   If someone comes to me and says, hey, I'm going to pack more people into the property,
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.720]   my mind automatically goes to, OK, that's more maintenance costs.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.080]   That's more wear and tear on the property.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.240]   But now if they say, hey, we've got this unfinished basement or this finished
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.520]   basement and I'm going to rent it out long term or I'm going to put travel nurses in
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.200]   there for three months at a time, would that be OK?
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.920]   And by the way, I'll throw you an extra 100 bucks a month or 200 bucks a month.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.760]   I'm going to say, hey, great, I'll take that extra increased rent.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.800]   And I think if you have the conversation that way with the landlord of, hey, they're
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.200]   all being screened, they're going through a process, they're paying their own security
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.520]   deposit, I'm still going to be responsible for everything.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.320]   I think a landlord, if you have a decent conversation with them and they see the
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   benefit to them of, hey, there's more money coming into that property, so there's a
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.760]   better chance all continually getting paid.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.520]   And if there's a little more upside for me, that's great.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   I mean, I have a good sort of we'll call him an Internet friend.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.040]   He was in San Diego.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.680]   His housing allowance from the military was three thousand dollars a month.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:18.400]   So he rented a nice big house that had a basement and he put that basement on Airbnb.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.240]   So not only was his rent about three thousand dollars, which took up his whole
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.040]   housing allowance, he was bringing in another fifteen hundred to three grand a
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.720]   month from that Airbnb place.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.880]   So not only was he living for free, but then he was bringing in twenty five, thirty
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.120]   grand a year and he worked it out with his landlord and his landlord didn't care.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.200]   Wow, that's amazing.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.080]   OK, so you could do it if you're renting.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.200]   But I know a lot of these opportunities are much better when you own the home.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.320]   If someone listening hasn't ever purchased a home, are there specific kind of
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.280]   requirements or prereqs that come to buying properties for these purposes that
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.880]   might change for, you know, just a traditional look for your first home?
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.760]   Or are they similar?
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.000]   Very similar.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.160]   And that's the great thing about house hacking is because you're buying the
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.880]   property to live in it, you now qualify for a owner occupied loan.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.240]   So just if I were to go out and buy a house to just normally live in, I can get
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.000]   those same loan programs if I were going to house hack a property.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.120]   Now, in some cases, there's a little extra qualification where they might ask to,
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.160]   you know, have you put down five percent instead of three and a half percent.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.960]   But most loan programs out there.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.600]   So if you're a veteran, there's the VA loan program.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.960]   You can buy a small multifamily property, a property with a walkout basement,
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.160]   exactly the same you would if you just bought a traditional single family home.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.240]   Same thing for an FHA loan.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.240]   You can buy a house three and a half percent down.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:55.840]   You know, so for a $300,000 home, you're looking at $11,000 and buy a two unit or
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.880]   buy that house with that unfinished basement and then use some of your
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.880]   savings to finish that basement.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.640]   So that's the great thing with house hacking is you get to use those same
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.200]   owner occupied loans that the average homeowner's using versus if I were to go
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.480]   buy it as a true investment property, I got to put down 20 percent.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.280]   So, you know, in that $300,000 home, I got to come up with 60 grand to buy that,
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.720]   say, duplex, where if you're house hacking it, you know, you're at $10,500, $11,000.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.800]   Wow.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.400]   And so VA loans, obviously for people who've served in the military,
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.360]   who's an FHA loan for?
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.840]   Pretty much anyone.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:36.680]   They want you to be a first time home buyer or have not owned a home or not
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.680]   had an FHA loan in the past.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.960]   So it's a great option where if you're just going to go out and buy a property,
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.800]   use an FHA loan, low credit score requirement, low down payment requirement.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.720]   You don't have to have perfect credit.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.280]   And then what you get approved for is just based on your income.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.360]   Wow.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.520]   And you, and you said you only have to put down three and a half percent.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.200]   Yep.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.400]   Three and a half percent.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.080]   And then one of the really cool things when you go to buy a home and you can do
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.120]   this, if you're just buying it yourself, is you can negotiate with the seller to
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.240]   give you credits for closing costs.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:14.280]   So a lot of the times with those FHA loan programs, you can get credits, you can
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.880]   get a down payment assistant grant to help reduce that even lower.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.680]   Is there a limit on FHA loans?
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.480]   Yes, there is.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.400]   Great question.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.080]   So the FHA loan limit is going to be based off of where you live and based off
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.840]   of how many units in the property.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:34.040]   So one thing to touch on, you know, I say small multifamily, that's up to four
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:39.000]   units, soon as a property has five units or more in it, it's considered commercial.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.280]   So that's why you want to stick at those four units.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:48.160]   An FHA loan program will have a max loan limit for one unit, it increases for two
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.120]   unit and goes up for three and goes up for four.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.200]   So I think when I was looking a couple months back, buying a four unit there in
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.360]   Los Angeles, it was almost like a little over a million dollars was the FHA loan
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:13:59.720]   limit.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.320]   Now, obviously that's a higher priced part of the country versus say here in
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.800]   Louisiana where I'm at in New Orleans, the FHA loan limit is not going to be as
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.120]   high.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:13.320]   Or if you're in, you know, a very rural part of Iowa, the loan limit is going to
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.560]   be a bit lower.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.600]   Now, even if you're not eligible for FHA loan, you can still buy these as kind of
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.240]   traditional conventional mortgages and get a lot of the benefits of owning it by
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.520]   living in it, like property tax deduction and mortgage interest deduction and those
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:28.800]   things.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.600]   So there's always like what I'd say the four pillars of building wealth and real
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.160]   estate, right?
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.400]   So there's going to be appreciation.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.600]   So over the long term, you know, if you look at the Case-Shiller Index, which
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.120]   looks at real estate prices over the past, I think almost a hundred years, it's
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.240]   appreciated on average 3% a year.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.320]   There'll be dips, pullbacks, recessions, but you'll, you'll have that consistent
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.960]   appreciation over the longterm.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.760]   You've got your debt pay down.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.040]   So you've got a loan and you'll be generating income from some part of the
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:57.640]   property.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.640]   You get your tax benefits as well from your deduction.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.480]   And then, you know, you start to build some experience as a landlord as well.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.960]   And with that comes some potential cashflow where if you're getting monthly
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:16.760]   cashflow as well, on top of all the sort of maintenance and debt required to pay
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.520]   for the property.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.720]   So clearly you've put a lot of frameworks around this.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.800]   I mentioned earlier that, you know, you have a whole podcast about this.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.360]   How did you get started in house hacking and make this kind of your brand and
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:28.760]   passion?
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.040]   So it was really by accident.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.000]   So I'm 20 years old at this time, back in 2002.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   So starting to age myself just a little bit, but I was actually in the mortgage
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.440]   industry.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.600]   I was doing really well.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.120]   I started at 19, started doing sales.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.280]   I think that year I was making a little over a hundred grand.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.480]   I was getting ready to go rent a place with my buddy.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.520]   And we were looking at places and it's like two bedrooms, decent places, you
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.760]   know, a thousand bucks a month.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:59.520]   And then I was like, wait, a thousand dollars a month, I'm helping people go
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:04.080]   through loan applications and they're buying places and their payments were,
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.720]   you know, with taxes and insurance, eight, 900 bucks a month.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.960]   I was like, this doesn't make sense.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.920]   Like I'm going to go buy a place and then my buddy can rent a room from me.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.080]   And that's how it sort of all started where I started with house hacking and
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:22.160]   then started growing a real estate portfolio and then got away from house
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:22.520]   hacking.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.440]   But then when me and my wife got really serious and started building our life
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.320]   together, we went back to house hacking.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.080]   You know, she had never owned a property.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.880]   We had just moved to New Orleans.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.680]   And I said, you know, we really love to travel.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.080]   We're paying at that time, I think we're paying like $1,500 a month of rent.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.800]   And I was like, you know, that's 20 grand a year.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.240]   Why don't we do a house hack?
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:45.240]   We each put in some money and find a really cool property that lets us live
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:45.920]   for free.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.640]   And then that 20 grand that we're saving, we can use for travel.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.080]   And that just sold her on it.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.440]   We ended up having this really cool property in New Orleans.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.080]   We converted it from this whole corner store to three high-end
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.400]   apartments with a ADU out back.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.320]   We lived in this two bedroom, one bathroom.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.720]   And folks, let me tell you this.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.800]   My wife wasn't going to live in a dump by any means.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.160]   I mean, we had like this 60 gallon soaker tub with the jacuzzi jets.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.120]   She had that clay fire house, farm sink thing that she really wanted.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.240]   You know, 11 foot ceilings, hardwood floors.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.120]   And it was perfect for us at two bedrooms and one bathroom and saving
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.160]   20 grand a year.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:31.040]   And that property also gave us an extra eight to 10 grand a year in profit on top
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.320]   of paying all the expenses for the property because we had so many units in it.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.720]   So it worked out phenomenal for us.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.160]   And that convinced her to do my fourth house hack, which we went from that two
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.360]   bedroom, one bathroom to now, you know, we're going to be in a three bedroom,
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.040]   three bathroom on our side.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.920]   So, you know, that, that was sort of how I started, went on a little bit of a
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.200]   tangent. We got away from a different point of life and then we started to get
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.960]   back to it just to say like, "Hey, you know, she had her finances.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.800]   I had mine.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.160]   Let's start building our financial life together."
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.200]   And house hacking is a great way to do it.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.600]   And again, you know, we didn't need a fancy car.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.600]   We'd rather just go travel and put our money towards that.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.280]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.160]   So I didn't know house hacking was a thing until I similarly found out that,
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.400]   "Oh, I guess I was doing it."
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.840]   So our story is a little similar.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.320]   We were looking for a place in San Francisco.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.360]   And one of the reasons I often tell people not to buy a home is that, you
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.520]   know, the cost of buying and selling a home, there's real estate commissions and
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.680]   closing costs and everything.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.640]   And so the kind of general rule of thumb is if you're not going to be somewhere
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.480]   for five years, you probably won't recoup all those costs.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.480]   And when you're young, you know, you think, "Well, I need a place that I'll be
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.200]   able to live in for five years."
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.360]   So you're kind of incentivized to buy the place that you think you would need five
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.440]   years from now, which might not be a one-bedroom.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.240]   It might be a two-bedroom or a three-bedroom.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.480]   And I've always said, you know, you don't want to prepay for all that space.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.520]   So if in four years you need a three-bedroom place, but right now you
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.080]   don't, if you buy, you're going to end up paying for three bedrooms for a few
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.320]   years that you don't need it.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.320]   And so when you compare it to renting, it should be fair to compare it to, "Well,
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.920]   for two years, I'll rent a one-bedroom.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.520]   And then two years, I'll rent a two-bedroom.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.320]   And then I'll switch."
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.200]   And so I often think until you're at a place where the kind of house you're
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.800]   renting is the same kind of size and style of what you'd need five years from
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.560]   now, that's a challenge.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:31.080]   And, but we're still looking, we're still, you know, taking, touring some open
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.600]   houses.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   And this was probably around 2010, 2011.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:40.720]   And we saw this house and it was three bedrooms, but on the ground floor, it was
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.840]   kind of a San Francisco style, walk up, enter on the second floor.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.960]   But the ground floor had its own entrance.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.080]   And we thought, "Oh my gosh.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.440]   Well, one day we might want three bedrooms, but we can't afford a home that has
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.600]   three bedrooms now.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.880]   But if we bought one and then immediately started renting it out, we could use that
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:03.040]   rental income to offset the cost of buying a house that was bigger than we needed.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.200]   And then at some point in the future, if we want a third bedroom, instead of
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.840]   selling a two-bedroom house and buying a three-bedroom house, we just stop renting
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.960]   out our, as you call it, income suite.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.840]   And I think something that maybe people don't realize, and this is maybe much more
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:25.960]   true in, you know, urban areas with lots of places to eat nearby, but you don't need a
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.880]   full kitchen suite to have an income suite.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:34.680]   We turned a bedroom with its own en suite bathroom into a rental and rented it for
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.720]   almost seven, eight years.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.280]   And there wasn't a kitchen in there.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.360]   And people knew that.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.240]   Some people worked at Google and got their meals paid for.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.960]   Some people just went out to a coffee shop and some people use a microwave, a
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.920]   hot plate and a mini fridge, but we were able to just turn a regular bedroom with
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.360]   its own entrance into a rental unit.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.760]   And that effectively covered our mortgage payment for almost seven years.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.600]   That's awesome.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.640]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.400]   the cracks start to emerge.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.560]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.520]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:19.160]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025, one 37,000.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.680]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.040]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.

[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.120]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less close their books in
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.840]   days, not weeks and drive down costs.

[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:26.000]   allthehacks.com/netsuite, N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.160]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.880]   is actually so good for you.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.640]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.040]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.480]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:48.720]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.040]   year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.800]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.160]   toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.640]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.880]   pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.640]   and are so travel friendly.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.920]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.600]   Pu-erh for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-erh, which helps kickstart
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.760]   digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.400]   one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.000]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research backed
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.280]   benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.720]   And then be happy that Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.560]   than all other teas in the world.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.120]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.920]   offers free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:52.520]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:58.800]   tea samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.320]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.280]   You know, I think you mentioned a good point.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.920]   Like people don't always need a lot of stuff or need that full kitchen.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.480]   You know, the way I always looked at it is there's three types of tenants.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.680]   You've got your short-term tenant, you know, folks that are
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.640]   going to stay less than 30 days.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.720]   When people hear short-term tenants or short-term rentals, they
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.640]   think of like Airbnb, VRBO.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.840]   So a lot of times if you've got that income space that could become an income
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.000]   suite and it doesn't have a full kitchen or really any kitchen, I mean, you can
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.560]   throw in a microwave and like a kettle for some coffee or French press or
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.920]   a Keurig or something like that.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.320]   Those folks, most of the time they're in a city, they want to go out and eat.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.600]   And then, you know, the next step up is a midterm tenant.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.400]   You know, those are folks that usually stay 30 days to six months.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.480]   These are, you know, traveling corporate executives, they need a furnished place.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.000]   They don't want to be in a hotel for three months or your traveling nurse.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.600]   You know, we've rented to a lot of traveling nurses.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:02.320]   And while the place we had for those midterm tenants had a small little
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.800]   kitchenette, they were eating in the hospital cafeteria every time they were
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.240]   working.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.400]   And since they were only there for three months when they weren't working, they
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.040]   were out at the coffee shop, they were out, you know, enjoying dinner at a local
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.720]   hotspot.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.640]   And then that third tenant base is that long-term tenant that's there for 12
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:18.960]   months.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.600]   But even then, a lot of times the longer-term tenants, they don't need a lot
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.240]   of space.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.240]   You know, the grad student or the person like at like a Google that has all those
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.320]   benefits there at work.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.880]   So there's a lot of options.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.360]   And if you think through like, "Hey, what's the best type of house hack that
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.160]   fits my need?"
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.480]   And then pair that with, "What's the best type of tenant base that also fits the
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.440]   space and what I like as well?"
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.120]   Yeah, I think it's interesting.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:51.200]   I've always been a bit turned off by rental properties as a thing to own because
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.480]   I wasn't really that excited about being a full-time landlord.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:00.120]   But I think I found when I was running this, I guess, income suite, when it's
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:05.400]   nearby and it's a house you know and understand because it's yours, it's much
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:10.480]   less work than if you had a property 40 minutes away or even 15 minutes where
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.480]   you've got to drive over and figure out what happens.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.280]   And so I actually found it to be a little less work than I thought.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.440]   But earlier, you said something about net profit.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.320]   And I think something that maybe I naively didn't think about was anytime
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.600]   you're buying something that you wouldn't otherwise need for the purpose of
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.960]   generating income, you still have to look at it like a business.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:36.400]   And you could think that, "Oh, if I could get this much for rent, it would break
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:36.760]   even."
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:42.120]   But you might not realize it's hard to keep a place occupied 100% of the time.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.720]   And there are maintenance things.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.720]   Could you walk through all the things that you would be thinking about if you
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:52.680]   were considering getting a space to rent it out, the different costs, and how to
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.280]   make sure it really will be a good income producer?
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.320]   Yeah, so I'll start with maybe just an overview of what you'd want to think if
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.160]   it was a true investment property.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.320]   And then we can sort of tie in how that relates to house hacking.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.280]   Because I think you should have that same mentality of, "Am I going to buy this
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.800]   property, just a house hack, and then sell it when I'm done?
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.640]   Or do I want to turn it into a long-term rental?"
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:20.600]   So the place my wife and I bought in Uptown, New Orleans, our goal was to turn
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.280]   that into a full rental property.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.120]   So that's still cash flowing and it's great.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.600]   So first thing I look at is, what could be the gross rent?
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.520]   You can use a tool like Rent-A-Meter.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.560]   And there's a lot of other things that will say, "Hey, here's what a one-bedroom
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.000]   should rent for in your city," or a three-bedroom and two-bathroom.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.040]   And then you want to look at vacancy.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.760]   So you just Google your city and average vacancy rate, it's going to come up.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.320]   But what you want to think about is, even if a tenant moves out on day one, you're
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.400]   going to have to clean it, you're going to have to do some stuff, and you start
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.880]   marketing it, there's very few tenants that want to move in the next day.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.960]   So you got to figure it's going to be empty for at least a week, if not a month.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:06.920]   So figure out vacancy, plan to have it empty two to four weeks out of a year if
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.560]   a tenant's turning over every year.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.000]   You want to look at what's called maintenance.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.040]   So this is little things like, "Hey, the thermostat's not working.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.880]   I got to call the HVAC guy," or, "The fridge went out," little things like that.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:26.000]   Then you want to look at CapEx, so CapEx is a big capital expenditure.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   It's like the roof.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.440]   When's the roof going to go out?
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.000]   So you can say, "Hey, my roof's going to cost 20 grand to replace,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.040]   and it's due in 10 years.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:39.280]   I should be setting aside two grand a year over the next 10 years so I can afford it."
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:45.160]   And so you can figure out some of the bigger things on your house and then back
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:49.200]   those out over a period of a year to figure out how much you'd be setting aside.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:54.760]   The rule of thumb for maintenance is to set aside five to 10% of your gross rent.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:29:01.360]   So if you're renting a duplex and you're getting $1,500 for each side, $3,000 a
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:06.320]   month, you're going to want to set aside about $150 to $250 a month.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.960]   Some months, you'll never have maintenance.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.200]   And then other months, all of a sudden, the fridge goes out, can't be fixed.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.400]   You got to buy a brand new fridge, a thousand bucks.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.800]   And then you're just going to want to look at any, what I call miscellaneous
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:24.080]   stuff, utilities, do I got to do trash, lawn care, shoveling snow, things like that.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.920]   A lot of that you can do yourself or you can hire it out if you don't want to.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.880]   And then the last thing to think about is property management.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.560]   So do I actually want to manage the tenants?
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.680]   If they're on the other side of the property or they're in my finished
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.640]   basement, maybe I don't mind doing it.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.200]   Or, Hey, I want a house that can not deal with anyone.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.000]   Let me hire a property manager.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.840]   Property manager is going to take eight to 10% of those gross rents.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.520]   So if you've got a place that's renting for $1,500, figure a property manager is
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:00.720]   going to take on average about $150 of that, so you sort of look at those
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.200]   expenses of a rental and then you should do that for a house act, but say, great.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.520]   Well, if, if I'm living in one part, what, what should this part rent for?
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:10.880]   Okay.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.960]   So I should be thinking about that for setting aside for maintenance.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.840]   I should be thinking about what the big things are for
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.720]   CapEx, setting those aside.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.600]   Obviously there's not going to be vacancy on my side.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.160]   There will be on the tenants portion.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.840]   And then you can sort of look at that and say, great.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.560]   You know, how is that working out compared to what the mortgage is?
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.280]   And then the other thing I think about is housing savings.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.840]   So, you know, when me and my wife moved to new Orleans, the place we were
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.080]   renting was like $1,500 a month.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:46.360]   So we realized, Hey, we could go into this house hack and we could bring in
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.640]   enough income to cover all the mortgage.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.880]   And if we rented out the ADU, we'd have an upside, but we looked at it of great.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:59.160]   So we're breaking even we're covering the mortgage taxes and insurance, but now all
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.120]   of a sudden, you know, that that's breaking us even, but we're saving $1,500 a month
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.720]   from what we were previously paying.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.080]   So there's that savings there.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:08.880]   So we said, great.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.840]   If we are saving 1,500 a month, let's put aside 500 for maintenance and CapEx.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:19.000]   And then if our, our outbuilding or ADU guest house, anything we get above
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.560]   that is the gravy money.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:25.400]   So, you know, for in that situation, we went from renting paying 20 grand a year
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:30.720]   to living in the house act, saving 20 grand a year from not paying rent, plus
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:35.320]   having an extra eight to 10 grand a month on top of that, on top of paying all of
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.360]   that mortgage taxes and insurance.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.960]   So that's sort of like a, a long, long way to think about how to look at a house
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:48.560]   hack and then how to think about analyzing a rental property of all the fees you
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.200]   need to think about that could be in there.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:55.320]   Is there any kind of ratio of average rent to average purchase price to get a
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.480]   sense of like, is this a good place to, you know, whether it's a rental property
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.640]   or a house hack to do it?
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.120]   So the, there used to be this old rule of thumb called the 1% rule.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.560]   And I look at this as just it's back to the napkin rule of thumb.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:14.800]   So if you're buying a place for a hundred thousand, it should rent for 1%, a thousand
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:20.240]   a month in very high cost of living areas that just doesn't work very well.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.080]   And again, that's just a rule of thumb.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.640]   I, I use that as, Hey, a realtor sent me a deal.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.200]   They think it'll be a good rental property.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.840]   I can really quickly look and say, you know, does it meet the 1% rule?
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.960]   Is it close to it?
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.520]   If so, then I'll go spend the time of walking through the property.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.400]   It's just tough to see if it will actually work in a place like a San
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.200]   Francisco or a New York city.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.200]   Most of the other parts of the country, it's a nice little rule of thumb to use.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.080]   But again, it's just that it's just a rule of thumb.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:51.880]   That makes sense.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:57.320]   And, you know, as much as I enjoyed being a landlord from the income producing
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.960]   side, the, you mentioned a property manager and that was something that I, I
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.440]   never considered, but does that include all the maintenance issues is hiring a
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.720]   property manager going to mean that at midnight, if the sink stops up, I'm
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.960]   not getting the phone call.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.320]   So a property manager is really going to do three areas, right?
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.480]   It's, we're going to take, take over the property in the sense
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.080]   of here's the rental unit.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.360]   They're going to market it.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.000]   They're going to find tenants.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.920]   They're going to screen tenants, make sure, you know, credit background
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.640]   check, they're going to price the unit.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.400]   And then there, when they find a good applicant, they're going to go through
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.240]   signing a lease and they're going to put the tenant in it.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.320]   So I sort of that first piece of property management does is
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.880]   market and fill the unit.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.880]   The second piece they do is manage the property ongoing.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:49.080]   So if that tenant calls at two in the morning, says the toilets broke in and
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:54.080]   backed up or the sink won't stop running, they're going to be calling the property
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.280]   management company, not you.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.000]   And then the property management company is going to send out a maintenance person.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.160]   Now their fee won't cover the maintenance costs, that service costs.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.080]   So if the plumber sends them a bill for 250, they're going to
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.200]   pass that bill on to you to pay.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.960]   But they're managing that process, which is pretty nice because a lot of times
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.720]   when stuff seems to go wrong with the property, it goes wrong when you're
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.480]   traveling or you're at work in a meeting and can't get your phone.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.400]   So it's, it's great to have the property management take care of that.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.120]   So they sort of do that ongoing management.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.480]   And then the third piece that the property management will take
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.200]   care of is what I call the lease renewal or turnover.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:39.120]   So, you know, the tenant signed a one-year lease, you know, the lease
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.080]   is getting ready to expire in 45 days.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.600]   The property management company is going to reach out to them,
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.240]   ask them to re-sign a lease.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.560]   They'll go through that re-signing process, update the lease,
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.480]   re-verify any information.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.640]   Or if they're going to move out, they'll go through the whole move-out process,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:01.120]   getting the property cleaned back up and ready to go back into that first
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.200]   phase of remarketing and filling it.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.120]   I always say for new folks, you should manage your property for at least the
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:11.200]   first year, just so you understand the process and then turn it
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.600]   over to a property manager.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.520]   It'll make you more effective at working with a property manager because
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.280]   you'll understand what, what they're doing.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.200]   But again, if you're that person that says, look, I'd love the house act.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.600]   I just don't ever want to deal with the tenants.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.520]   There's a lot of folks that will tell the tenants that they're just a renter
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:32.320]   also, and the property manager takes care of it and they don't know who the owner is.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.880]   So there's a lot of different ways you can approach it.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.160]   But property management is a great, great way to go.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.120]   If you want to be hands-off as possible.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:40.960]   That's amazing.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.160]   I love the idea of not, not telling the other person that you're the owner.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.960]   So you can kind of be, "Oh, that terrible owner.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.720]   You know, this thing's always clogging up."
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.320]   I want to jump back to a couple of the types of house hacking.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.120]   And one in particular is ADUs.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:00.800]   And if I run through them again, it's kind of obvious, you know, room rental,
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.000]   renting, having roommates makes sense, buying a duplex, turning something in
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.240]   the house, whether it's a basement, an attic, or an extra bedroom that has an
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.640]   entrance into an income suite.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.600]   But ADUs are interesting because I don't know a lot about them.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:17.560]   Is this something where it's easy to just build one on your property?
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.800]   Do you need permits?
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:25.720]   So the thing I love about an ADU is right now the multifamily market is so hot.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:30.600]   Like if you try to find a duplex or a triplex, they go really quick because so
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.760]   many people want to be in real estate.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.560]   But if you look at properties that have that detached building, you're just going
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.400]   to be competing with the average home buyer.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:45.040]   And then a lot of folks nowadays, when you've got homes, they like the garage
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.800]   actually attached to the building.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.960]   So it's a really easy way to find a property to house hack.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.680]   You specifically look for those detached buildings.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.040]   And then what you can do is if the building's existing, it's pretty
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.440]   easy to get it converted.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:03.280]   You do need to get some permits if you got to run new electrical and plumbing to it.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.280]   You know, luckily with like the ADU, we had plumbing and electrical lines were
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:12.760]   already ran out there and we were able to keep a one-car garage and then
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.080]   convert it into this two-story loft.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.880]   So it just sort of depends on that side.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.120]   If it's an existing building, it's a lot easier.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.280]   Now, if you have the space to build a building, that's going to
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.760]   be a little bit more challenging.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.960]   So one of the things down in LA that they did is there's
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.600]   obviously a housing problem.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:35.760]   So one of the ways to solve a housing problem is you allow more density in housing.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.040]   So they actually passed laws to let people start to build ADUs because
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.240]   they said, "Hey, this is an easy way to add more rental units.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.880]   Let someone build an accessory dwelling unit."
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.160]   So you can actually go through the process of having plans drawn up, building a brand
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:56.360]   new building and making that guest house, outside building rental.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.000]   And it's a pretty cool process because you can customize it.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.480]   I'll send you for your show notes.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:06.800]   We actually interviewed a designer and builder that builds ADUs.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.600]   That's all he specializes in.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:12.520]   And he has some really, really cool knowledge about how to build a smaller
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.360]   space, make it really more effective.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.880]   And he works specifically in California, but it was a phenomenal episode.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.720]   And he talks about going through the zoning and building permitting process.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.000]   But it's one of those phenomenal things that you can do where you can build an ADU.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.840]   And while maybe you live in the ADU and you rent the big house when you're young
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:36.160]   and you're single, or maybe you're just a young couple, and then once you start a
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:41.680]   family, move into the bigger building and now rent the ADU, you can rent the ADU on
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.280]   Airbnb, you can rent it to travel nurses, you can do a long-term tenant.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.560]   And then as your life changes and you've got that teenager and you don't want them
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.680]   in the house because they're moody and they hate mom and dad, put them out in
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:58.600]   that ADU, right? And now the ADU can just be this really cool way of how you can
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.920]   live in that property.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.520]   And over a 10 or 15 year period, that property can transition with you through
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:09.960]   life by starting the smaller unit and renting the bigger unit and then switching.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:13.880]   And then it's just a cool way to have it work with you through life.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.920]   It sounds like a great idea if you have the space.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.840]   How much ballpark does it cost to build an ADU on your land?
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:30.000]   I think $40,000 to $75,000, just depending where you're at in the country, any
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.720]   permitting fees that are out there and how big you want to make it.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:39.480]   Obviously, if you're trying to make a three-bedroom ADU completely from scratch,
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.840]   they got to pour a foundation.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:46.280]   Our ADU, because it was this old existing barn building, the frame was there, it had
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:51.760]   a roof on it. We had to replace the roof, the windows were good, we had to do new
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.840]   siding. But we probably spent $25,000 on our ADU.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.960]   And right now we have travel nurses in it at $1,000 a month.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:07.120]   So if you're looking at just a basic ROI, even if we spent $40,000 on it, that's
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:12.360]   bringing in $12,000 a year, simple ROI, you're making a really good return there.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.840]   And I assume when you turn around, if you ever sell that property, the value of that
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.960]   property goes up as well.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.800]   It's not just extra income, but the whole value goes up.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:27.040]   Yep. Now, an ADU isn't valued the exact same way as the main building, but because
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:32.760]   it's a heated and cooled condition space, it does drastically increase the value of
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.400]   the property.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:38.480]   Can the cost that you need to build an ADU, can you add that to your mortgage?
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:43.400]   Is there a way to build it if you don't have the $40,000, $70,000 in cash?
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:49.720]   Yeah. So a lot of people, they'll get a first mortgage and then they'll say, "Hey,
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.040]   great, we're buying this property.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.760]   There's like a garage building on there.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:57.400]   We know we want to convert it or there's space and our city and county will let us
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:02.280]   build it." So they'll either use savings or if they've got, say they've been living
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.480]   in the property, like, "Hey, we can actually do this." A lot of folks will use an
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.400]   equity line. So they'll get that second mortgage equity line on their property and
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:16.600]   they'll get that equity line for $50,000 and use that to pay for that building.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.280]   And then once the building's done, the value of the property is increased.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.480]   They refinance and pay off that equity line or second mortgage.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.960]   And now they've just got the one flat rate, low payment mortgage.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.480]   And then you've got that higher appraise value to do that.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:38.960]   Yeah. One thing we didn't talk about much, when you said the straight cost, right?
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.560]   You just get $1,000 a month, that's $12,000 a year.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.240]   How do taxes play into house hacking?
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.840]   And I know neither of us are CPAs, but we'd love your...
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.920]   Good disclaimer.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:55.920]   Yeah. So you're definitely going to want to work with an accountant.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.440]   A good accountant is going to save you more money than they cost.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:04.280]   So one of the things, when you look at a property to house hack, when you're living in it,
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:10.120]   let's just say, I'll use that, our property we had in Uptown, three units in the main
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.200]   building, and then we had an ADU.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.520]   We were living in roughly 25% of the building.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:22.640]   So what our accountant did is say, great, the other 75% of the property is rental, is
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.960]   considered rental property.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.760]   That was generating X amount in gross rent.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:34.360]   We could back out 75% of our mortgage, 75% of our taxes, 75% of the utility bills for
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:39.800]   the property. We paid all the exterior lights, any maintenance costs were deducted from
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.480]   those gross rents that we are collected.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.680]   And then what was left, we had depreciation.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:52.320]   And this is one of the big wealth builders for depreciation is, I'll try to oversimplify
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:57.680]   this, depreciation, the IRS says, let's take the value of the property, divide it by 27
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.760]   and a half years.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:04.480]   And that gives you a depreciated value where the value of the property should be less
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:10.680]   each year. So with our Uptown property, we had about 16 to 18 thousand dollars in
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.880]   depreciation a year.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.280]   And that was essentially wiping out all of our gain.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.000]   And I'm doing air quotes for folks that are only listening.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:26.200]   So we ended up paying zero taxes on all that extra income we had after paying all of
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:32.320]   the expenses. And that's why so many millionaires and multi-millionaires own real
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.720]   estate is because it's such an incredibly wealth building tool.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:41.840]   You've got that tax benefit, you've got the appreciation, the tenants are paying down
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.840]   the mortgage, which is essentially like a forced savings account for you.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.440]   And then you're getting the cash flow as well.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.360]   So it's a beautiful, beautiful way to build wealth.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:56.440]   Yeah. I mean, the one thing you just said, the forced savings vehicle, I think, is a
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:01.280]   really important point to hit on, because when we were in San Francisco, we had an
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.000]   apartment and the rent was covering the mortgage payment.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.400]   And I often had people say, well, what about the property tax?
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:12.000]   I said, OK, well, it didn't cover all of that, but the mortgage payment was paying
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.880]   down the house. And so, you know, I was thinking, OK, well, I'm actually able when
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.400]   we sell the house to recoup a lot of the equity value I've put in.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:28.200]   So, you know, if you're looking at these costs, in some ways you could say, as long
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.600]   as the amount I'm making covers all of my expenses, the property tax, the
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:37.080]   maintenance, and it doesn't actually have to cover your whole mortgage, even if it
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.480]   just covers the interest portion of the mortgage.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:44.240]   That's all of your outlay, because the way I like to think about it is every dollar
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.040]   you put towards the principle of your home, that's a dollar you get back later in
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.720]   life. Obviously, it's possible that home value doesn't go up.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:55.720]   But in general, like you said, in the long run, all your principle payments are
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.480]   coming back to you when you sell the house.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.800]   So you don't have to cover the whole mortgage for this to still be a good deal.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.560]   Well, just since we've been talking about our property in uptown, the tenants are
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:10.880]   paying down the mortgage, which is putting about $10,000 to $11,000 here in
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.480]   2021, paying down on the principle.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.640]   You know, that's $11,000 that our net worth is increasing on top of the cash flow, on
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.040]   top of the appreciation.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.760]   And, you know, I love real estate for so many reasons, but let's say the property
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.560]   never appreciates. Let's just say it always stays flat.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:31.720]   You're still going to have equity growth because of that principle pay down.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.400]   So if the property stays flat, you win.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.520]   If the property value goes up, you win.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:41.280]   If the property value goes down and only stays down, you lose.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.560]   But most likely what's going to happen if you're looking at a longer hold period,
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.720]   it'll go down and then it'll go back up.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.320]   So there's just so many ways to benefit from real estate investing.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:54.720]   And, you know, house hacking is this great tool to get your foot in the door to do
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.160]   broader real estate investing.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:01.160]   But if you never want to be a real estate investor, just use house hacking as an
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.520]   amazing life hack, right?
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:07.320]   Use it for three, four or five years to get ahead financially, to pay down your
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.240]   student loans, to pay down the credit cards that you ran up.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.680]   Maybe you're just having your first child and say, hey, you know, we can live in a
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.440]   small two bedroom for, you know, four or five years.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:23.400]   Use that savings to max out a bunch of money into a 529 plan for your child and
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.600]   then stop putting money in.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.480]   And, you know, when they're ready for college, there'll be plenty of money in
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.560]   there for them. It's a really amazing hack that you can use.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.400]   As long as you want, or as short as you want.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.440]   Or like you said, take it and travel.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.240]   Something we both love doing.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:45.760]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact, and Trade Coffee is a
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.040]   great addition to your new year routine.

[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:28.720]   But this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.040]   Bark the Moon, and it's so delicious.

[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:57.120]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.240]   up your cooking at home?
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.760]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.160]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:09.000]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.320]   cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:13.960]   this episode.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.320]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.760]   scratch in the microwave.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.320]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.520]   and simplifies the process so much.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:31.320]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:36.720]   reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.080]   too.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:41.320]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I highly
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.360]   recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.760]   It is so good.

[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.320]   year, you have to check it out.

[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.800]   Over the years, it sounds like you've bought and sold quite a few properties.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:32.080]   You know, I know not everyone here is thinking about house hacking, but, you
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.880]   know, many people are thinking about buying homes or selling homes.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:39.960]   Are there hacks or tips or tricks you'd give people, whether it's for a house
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:43.680]   hack, a rental property, or a primary residence when you're looking for a house
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:47.160]   or selling a house to keep in mind that not everyone knows about?
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:52.360]   Yeah, so on the buying side, I would say look for the problems.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.560]   Look for the ugly houses.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:59.320]   If you can find the ugliest house in the best neighborhood, you can go in and spend
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.440]   time to fix it up.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:04.680]   You know, if you put in a little bit of TLC, a little bit of love, you can end up
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.800]   with a great deal and then you can really customize the house.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:12.960]   I love when I see pictures online of houses and they've got the pink tubs and the
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:18.360]   pink tiles that are from the 70s because to me that says, "Hey, this is awesome.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.880]   I can customize that bathroom and bring it up to date."
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:26.240]   And that's really going to increase the value where the average homeowner might
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.000]   walk through and be like, "Oh my goodness, this is a horrible bathroom.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.080]   I would never live here."
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.400]   And they go out.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:36.760]   I love smelly houses as well because the average person doesn't want to deal with
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.720]   the smelly house.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.680]   Me, I think a smelly house, I'm like, "This is awesome."
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.400]   You know, I get a smile on my face when the realtor is like, "It's gross."
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:50.720]   Because you rip out all the carpet, you wash everything down with this cleaner
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.680]   called TSP, you run a no-zone machine and that kills the smell.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:59.160]   And then you do a kill paint sealer on everything and then you put it back
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:50:59.600]   together.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:04.720]   So I look for the things that the average homeowner doesn't want to deal with.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:11.120]   I also like when I go look on like realtor.com or Redfin, I do the reverse
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:11.480]   search.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.640]   So usually I say, "Hey, this property just came on two hours ago."
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.400]   Everyone's looking at that one.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:20.680]   I say, "Show me the property that's been on the longest," because that person is
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:24.400]   probably willing to negotiate and willing to cut their price.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.960]   And then the other thing when you're buying a property, it's sometimes hard to
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:34.240]   do in a really hot market, but ask the seller to pay a portion of the closing
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:34.560]   cost.
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.400]   They can give you a seller credit or a seller concession, and that can just
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.160]   reduce your cash to closing.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:47.240]   So even if you've got 20, 30, 50 grand saved up, closing costs can easily run
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.760]   you depending on where you're at in the country, eight to 10 grand.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:54.480]   So if you can get the seller to pay part of that, look at that as a lever.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:59.680]   So maybe they, for whatever reason, they have to have a five, they've got to sell
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.000]   their house for 500,000.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.800]   So say, "Great, I'll give you that 500,000, but can you give me $7,000 in
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.680]   closing costs credit?"
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:16.520]   And a lot of times folks will say yes to that, but they won't say yes to a $493,000
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.320]   sales price.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:21.560]   So look at the different levers that you can pull and a good realtor can help you
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:22.200]   with those.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:28.000]   For the house we just purchased last year, there were a handful of things that were
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.160]   just part of the staging.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.920]   And we were like, "We just really like this TV.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.320]   It's already mounted to the wall.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.720]   It's exactly where we'd want it."
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:40.200]   We really liked these lime trees that were all around the yard that weren't part of
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.160]   the yard because they were staged plants.
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:46.880]   And we're like, "We'll do this deal, but can you just throw in a long list of
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.360]   things?"
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:52.160]   And especially these things that have prices that are kind of unknown, but
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:55.720]   relative to the cost of the house, everyone knows they're pretty small.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:01.480]   The sellers were willing to flex, but they were not willing to flex on the price.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:06.560]   So I love this idea of just finding all the ways that you can kind of get something
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:08.280]   out of the deal that aren't the price.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:08.880]   Yep.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:14.080]   Because yeah, so many people, they mentally get stuck on this idea of like, "I need
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.360]   this certain price because they'll feel good about it."
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:22.080]   And maybe the lime trees were only $200 a lime tree or maybe they were $1,000 a lime
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.800]   tree, but to them it's like, "Oh, it's a little lime tree in a pot.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:25.400]   Great.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.600]   Like I'm getting my number."
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.920]   So yeah, flex on that.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.960]   So those are a couple of things on the buy side.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:34.840]   If you're getting ready to sell a property, deep clean your property and then bring
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:37.680]   someone in to help stage it or declutter it.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:43.160]   I'm really big on, I know what I'm good at and it's worth spending money on experts.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.920]   You know, one of my early real estate mentors, he goes, "Andrew, if you ever get
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:51.920]   in financial trouble with tenants over leases or potential lawsuits or
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:57.120]   negotiation issues, figure out the best lawyer you think you can hire and then go
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.200]   hire someone better.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.440]   It'll pay off."
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.440]   And I'm that same way.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.960]   If I'm going to sell a property, I'm not going to try to skimp.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.240]   You know, I don't want the realtor that's going to cut a quarter percent off or a
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:12.720]   half percent off and then miss out on the realtor that's the rockstar that has the
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.960]   giant team, has the giant network.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.840]   I feel like I'm okay with design.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.200]   My wife is even better.
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:22.400]   But even with that, you know, this is stuff that we're emotionally attached to.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.000]   I want someone else to come in and say like, "Hey, you need to declutter this
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.520]   stuff. You need to remove that.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.280]   It's to your taste.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:33.920]   It's not common enough or generic enough that it's going to appeal to everyone."
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:38.320]   So I always say like, bring cleaners in to do a deep clean and then bring someone in
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.640]   to help declutter.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:44.360]   And even if you're keeping your stuff in there while it's being sold, have someone
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:46.240]   help stage it and rearrange it.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.800]   You know, maybe you've got the living room laid out where it's perfect for you all
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.640]   for sitting at the TV and it's comfortable and you've got all the extra pillows on
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.160]   it and, you know, throw rugs and all sorts of weird stuff.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:01.800]   But for the person coming in, the layout might seem a little funkier or might not
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:04.560]   flow with stuff or might not make the house present as well.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:09.560]   So to me, that curb appeal and that presentation on the inside really do go a
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.240]   long way.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:16.480]   Yeah, we paid a premium for good staging when we sold our San Francisco apartment and
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:21.520]   I regretted it for like the first week and then the house sold in a week and I did not
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:26.760]   regret it. And I think it's tough because, like you said, your style isn't always the
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.920]   style that sells.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:32.040]   And when you hire someone that's been doing this a lot, they know the style that
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:36.640]   sells. And they designed the house in a way that I was like, "I wouldn't want to live
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:39.360]   here." But, you know, it's what everyone wanted.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.240]   So I really like that advice.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:45.960]   The only thing I'll add, my brother-in-law gave me this advice, is when you're buying,
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:50.720]   whether it's through the real estate agent or if you can somehow get in touch with the
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:55.760]   sellers, if you can find out what the priority is, some people want to sell fast, some
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.080]   people want the highest number.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.240]   There's always one lever.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:05.280]   And if you identify that someone wants to get the highest offer, well, then you don't
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:09.120]   necessarily need to worry as much about how quickly you can close and maybe you could
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:12.280]   put in some contingencies, maybe not in today's market.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:17.000]   But if you find out that someone just cares about closing as fast as possible, then you
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.720]   can put in a time to close.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:25.480]   And the advice that he gave me, which I will caveat this with, it's certainly a risky
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.600]   move, was you can always...
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:32.680]   It's easier to extend an offer that's been accepted than it is to ask for longer time
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:38.000]   up front. So he said, "We guarantee a 15-day close." And I asked him, "How long did the
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.840]   bank say they could close?" And he's like, "Oh, they said 21." But I figured that once
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:47.040]   we're 15 days in, if I need seven more days, they'd rather give it to me than start the
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.480]   whole process over again and look for another person.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.680]   It's like, "Well, we're already almost all the way through with them, so let's give them
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.720]   a little bit more."
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:58.160]   So you mentioned hiring the best lawyer you can and then upgrading that if you have
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.440]   financial trouble with tenants.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.480]   I'll just ask, you've had a lot of tenants.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:06.200]   Have you had any fun stories or terrible things or interesting tales?
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:13.320]   So my original investing career was very focused on affordable housing and what I would
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:17.960]   call like student housing, college housing by universities back in North Carolina.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:23.440]   The affordable housing, I did a lot of aid work overseas, worked in places like
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.960]   Indonesia, Philippines, Kenya, Haiti.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:32.040]   So this idea of community development in very challenging places, coming back to where I
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:36.440]   lived, I was like, "Oh, this is nothing." So I did a lot of affordable housing and I
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:41.560]   wouldn't recommend affordable housing for anyone that's new, but it was a great way
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:42.240]   to get started.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:48.120]   I mean, I had a property where I was under contract on it and the SWAT team raided the
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:51.600]   apartment. So I think that would probably freak out most people.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:55.040]   What happened to me was I'm getting a better discount.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:59.560]   You know, so I mean, literally they came in, they knocked the doors off one of the
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:03.840]   rental units. This was a fourplex that I was buying and folks in the top unit were
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:04.880]   selling some drugs.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.120]   I knew it was a bad area.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.120]   I was planning on clearing out the unit.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:12.600]   But to me, that was automatically like, "This is a problem and a challenge.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:17.680]   There's upside for me." So I went back to the owner and I said, "Look, hey, this
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:22.400]   building," you know, I pretended to be nervous and scared and, "Oh my goodness, this
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:26.480]   is so horrible. I didn't know this was going on." And we negotiated the price down
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.120]   lower. But from my standpoint, it was like, "Well, I was going to put new doors on all
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:35.280]   the units. I wanted to get rid of that tenant anyways." So that just sort of solved
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:38.560]   that problem. And I could use that as a negotiating tool.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:43.840]   And then also in that affordable housing, I unfortunately had to do a lot of
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.120]   evictions. I think I probably did 20, 25 evictions.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:53.320]   I did them all myself except for one where the tenant appealed and then we had to go
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:54.560]   to a higher level court.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:57.520]   And at that level, I brought in a lawyer.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:02.640]   But the reason I won all of them was because I used leases.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:06.720]   So even if you're going to house hack and you're bringing in a friend to live in a
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:11.000]   room, get a lease and make sure to follow everything in that lease.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.440]   So I had great leases.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:15.720]   And if a tenant was late, I would deliver the notice.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:19.840]   And if they still hadn't paid, then we'd file in court and they'd come to court and
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:24.760]   they'd complain and say, "Oh, you know, this and that," or "He's a bad guy." And the
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:28.080]   judge will say, "Well, he brought you to court for not paying." And he delivered the
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.360]   notice. And here's proof that I delivered the notice.
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:31.520]   "Okay, why didn't you pay?
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:37.800]   Okay, great. Well, he wins." So if you have good leases, if something does come up in
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:42.000]   a worst case scenario, having all that stuff in writing is super valuable to have.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.360]   It's easy when you're house hacking and it feels a little less professional than
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.920]   running a rental property to kind of let things get a little casual.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:56.200]   I remember we had a friend of a friend looking for a place and we didn't take a
[00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:00.360]   security deposit because we were like, "Oh, it's just a friend." And then one day
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:04.120]   before they were supposed to move in, they backed out and we couldn't find a tenant
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.760]   on a day's notice. So we had about a month's worth of rent that ended up getting
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.560]   lost. And it was just a learning moment for me.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:16.240]   So my takeaway now is find a place that's smelly, that has a pink bathtub, and
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.480]   ideally that the SWAT team has recently raided.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.040]   Yes, yes, yes. If you find those three, that's the trifecta.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.040]   You're going to get a great deal on the property.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:29.880]   That's amazing. So right now, it's definitely a hot real estate market across
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:34.760]   the country. Does that make house hacking more appealing, less appealing? Any tips
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.800]   to take advantage of it?
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:43.880]   Yeah. So I'd say it can be both. Rents have gone up across the country. Obviously,
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.400]   there was in some areas last year due to COVID, where rental prices went down in
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.560]   major cities. But if you look at it, it's rebounding all across the country. If
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:59.520]   you're paying 30% or 40% of your income towards rent and you're not getting ahead
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:05.080]   financially, if you're making $20,000 a month and you're spending $8,000 on your
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:09.880]   housing and you've got $5,000 left over to put towards investments, cool, you're
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:14.640]   probably in a good spot. But for most folks, housing's taking up so much, it's
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:19.320]   not letting them pay down debt or put money away for investment. So to me, I'd
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.880]   say yes, you should really look at house hacking. And then in any market, there's
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.600]   going to be assets that are overvalued and there's going to be assets that are
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:32.480]   undervalued. And that's the same thing in real estate. You just got to go out and
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.280]   look at that property, that asset that's being undervalued for whatever reason,
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.800]   and then use that as a good property to house hack. So you get a lot of upside
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:47.440]   while reducing your housing costs. So even if there is a housing correction in
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:54.200]   the next two years and housing drops 10 or 15%, or say even 20%, but if you bought
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:02:00.360]   that property that was undervalued by 10 or 15%, and then you're able to go in and
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:05.480]   buy it and do some work to then increase it 10 or 15%. So even if there is that
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.680]   drop in two years, you're still going to be coming out pretty even if you can hold
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.840]   it for another year or two. And one other tip maybe I'll throw in here is in a hot
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.720]   market, if you think a property is good, and there's multiple offers, you can do
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:23.240]   something called an escalation clause, where basically says, here's my offer. If
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.640]   someone else comes in higher, you actually have to show me that offer. But
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:34.000]   my offer will automatically beat that offer by $1,000 or $2,000 or 5,000. And
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.160]   basically your offer will automatically escalate up into a cap. So maybe you want
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:44.080]   to buy this property for 300 grand. You'll say, great, here's what my offer is. I
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:49.040]   know the property still works up to $310,000. So I'm going to add in an
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:54.760]   escalation clause for $2,500 will automatically go up in a $2,500
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:01.320]   increment above any other offer at that cap. So that's a great way to get a
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.000]   property. You just got to be careful because some people will get emotional
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.600]   about a property and then overpay. But if you can find that undervalued asset,
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:14.320]   it's a great way to get into real estate, whether you're going to house hack or
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.380]   not. But I definitely think house hacking works in any market. And right now with
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:22.320]   housing so expensive and rent so expensive, it's a good tool to get ahead
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:26.520]   financially. Absolutely. I think most people aren't out there looking to house
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:32.360]   hack. So I know when we looked at places, having an ADU, having an income
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:36.360]   suite, especially when they're not labeled as such. When we were in San
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.920]   Francisco, it was a third bedroom with a second entrance. It wasn't marketed as an
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.840]   income suite. So being able to spot that, it wasn't charging a premium over
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.960]   other three bedrooms. So keep in mind as you're walking through a place, could we
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.880]   convert this to a rental? Could we make this an in-law unit? Could we build an ADU
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:57.440]   here? And you might be able to get yourself a really good deal. Well, I mean,
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.080]   the way most places with basements are marketed, it's like, "Oh, basement for
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:07.440]   kids or for the man cave." And someone's paying extra for that space when they
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:11.000]   might not need it. Where for us, we don't mind paying a little extra for that
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.640]   space because it can become a rental unit. So yeah, you just got to be open and
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:19.720]   creative and look for those hidden gems for properties. Awesome. This has been so
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.400]   fantastic. There will be a lot of links in the show notes that you guys have a
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.000]   guide about house hacking, your podcast, a couple of the episodes you mentioned.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.960]   Where can people find you and all this information online? Yeah, my website is

[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:43.400]   was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:47.640]   their employer's retirement plan. And that's just one of the many fascinating
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.720]   stats he shared. The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone. It's
