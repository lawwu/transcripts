[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.

[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.400]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.200]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.400]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to find all
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.200]   the hacks to optimize my life.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.360]   With housing being one of our largest expenses, I thought it would be
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.080]   amazing to do an episode about reducing your cost of living through house
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.880]   hacking, something I did for almost a decade that helped me save over $100,000.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.680]   And who better to have on than Andrew Kerr, a seasoned real estate investor
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.600]   and the founder of Financial Independence by Real Estate Investing, or fiibyria.com.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.720]   He's also worked for years in residential and small commercial banking, but most
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.880]   relevant to our conversation is that he's the host of The House Hacking Podcast.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.400]   In our conversation, we'll talk about the six different types of house hacks you
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.680]   can use to start saving money, roommate.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.600]   We'll also talk about some of his tips for buying and selling properties,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.160]   including in a hot market, and how to start thinking about real estate
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.400]   as a way to build your wealth.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.080]   It's going to be a great episode.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.000]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.560]   After I remind you.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.560]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.520]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.560]   and do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.000]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.680]   relied upon for investment decisions.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.360]   Andrew, thanks for being here.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.560]   Awesome, man.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.920]   Chris, I'm so excited.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.880]   We finally got the time to connect.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.800]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.760]   Yeah, I am excited.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.680]   And I just want to dive in really quick.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.400]   I don't know if everyone listening to this knows what house hacking is.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.680]   So I just want to start off by hearing you explain in your
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.000]   words, what house hacking is.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.680]   Awesome.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.840]   Yeah, I like the fact that you said my words because it's sort of changed
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.160]   over the world and the way media has talked about house hacking, it's
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.320]   sometimes only talked about one way.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.960]   To me, house hacking is doing anything creative with your housing options
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.160]   to help reduce your housing costs.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.240]   You know, the average person spends 30% of their income on housing.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.920]   So if you can take a housing choice, pick how you're going to live to
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.920]   reduce any of that or all of that cost, to me, that is house hacking.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.080]   And whenever anyone says, you know, the goal is to cut all these costs, I feel
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.720]   like it often comes with a connotation of, you know, living in a crappy,
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.920]   rundown apartment, this isn't that though, right?
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.120]   So that is one option.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.800]   And that's where, you know, a lot of the articles that are online are doing
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.960]   roommates or room rental style house hacking, where it's the young person in
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.040]   their twenties that's getting and living in a big house and having four or five
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.720]   roommates.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.360]   And, you know, to me, that is definitely a big sacrifice.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.120]   I could never convince my wife to do that, but house hacking can be pretty
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.640]   luxurious, dependent on the style that you pick and where you're living.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.360]   So like me and my wife, we're in the Bywater here in New Orleans.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.840]   It's a historic district.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.280]   We're in a historic home that runs about $600,000 once we're finishing out our
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.040]   renovations.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.640]   And we've got a tenant on the other side and we live in our side and they cover
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.520]   almost all of our housing costs.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.880]   So, you know, we're living in a amazing neighborhood.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.280]   We can walk to everything.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.680]   We rarely drive our car and it's just a beautiful building and it costs us
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.800]   almost nothing to live here.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.360]   So there's a lot of different ways to do house hacking, but most people prefer not
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.760]   that like dingy, dirty, a million roommate style of house hacking.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.920]   Yep. And these are, you said on the other side, are they in your sharing living
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.760]   space or is this completely separate?
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.840]   No. So this is what I'm doing is what we sort of call a small multifamily house
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.320]   hack. So it's where you buy a duplex, a triplex or a fourplex.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.960]   So, you know, in New Orleans, it was traditional where a family would buy a
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.320]   piece of land, build a building and make it into a two unit or a duplex.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.120]   So they've got their own entrance, own exit.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.080]   We even fenced off the backyard.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.640]   You know, we share a common wall all the way down the middle.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.400]   But outside of that, you know, we only see them if they're hanging out on the front
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.240]   porch and we're hanging out on the front porch.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.360]   Wow. And so that's one kind of house hacking.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.120]   The roommate style, you mentioned it, anyone could buy a place and get a bunch of
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.520]   roommates and charge rent.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.440]   Are there some other categories or is there a way you break it down?
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.520]   Yeah. So I sort of look at the six styles.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.640]   There's that room rental, the roommate style.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.600]   There's the small multifamily where you're buying the two unit, three unit or four
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.440]   unit. Then you've got the income suite.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.160]   So maybe you've got that walk up attic or that unfinished walk out basement and you
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.000]   convert that into an income suite.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.440]   So, you know, for folks that are maybe more in their 30s, they might remember a show.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.040]   I think it was like HDTV.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.600]   It was called Income Suite.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.840]   And that's all they did was take people's basement and convert it into an income
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.360]   suite. And that way there's no shared space.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.640]   The other way is called the ADU house hack.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.880]   So an ADU is a term for an accessory dwelling unit.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.200]   It's essentially an outbuilding on your land.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.360]   It's a sort of zoning or building code definition.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.120]   But that's where a lot of folks will, especially in California, where they've got
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.600]   that pool house, guest house or garage and convert it into an apartment.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   And now you've got sort of your main building and a small building on the same lot.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.640]   Then the next is a work provided house hacking where you specifically choose a career
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.120]   path or if you want to change careers, pick a career path where housing is provided.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.760]   So that could be, you know, teaching abroad, careers in the military.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.760]   There's a lot of sort of upper level white collar jobs where they're going to post you
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.040]   somewhere for three months, six months, a year, and they'll provide corporate housing.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.720]   And then the last option is a live in flip and a slow flip.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.680]   So most folks are familiar with flipping a house, you know, you go and you fix it up as
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.040]   quick as you can, you sell it.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.360]   But the idea with the slow flip is you live in it for at least a year, ideally two years.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.040]   That way, as you fix it up, it drastically appreciates in value.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.480]   And then when you go to sell it because you lived it in for two years, you don't have to
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.040]   pay taxes on any gain up to two hundred fifty thousand dollars if you're single or half a
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.120]   million if you're married.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.800]   So whereas a normal flipper, they'll flip a house and they could be paying 30, 40 percent
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.560]   in taxes on that money they made on the flip.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.800]   So those are the sort of six main styles.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.360]   You can combine them and there's a lot of other things you can do.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.640]   But those are the sort of six ways.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.560]   And do they all require buying a property or is there any type of rental based house
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.080]   hacking? Yeah, so that's actually a question I get a lot.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.640]   Folks will say, look, hey, I don't know what I can do yet.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.800]   My credit's not quite right.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.520]   I need to save money for a down payment.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.240]   Well, go rent a big house, get a big flat lease and put the lease in your name only.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.120]   And then you rent out the rooms to all your friends.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.200]   Or maybe you can find that house that does have that walkout basement and you can close
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:39.040]   it off and then separate it and put it on Airbnb or rent it out to travel nurses or put
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.240]   in a long term tenant.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.760]   Just the one thing you want to be careful of if you're renting a space is just look through
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.600]   the lease and make sure it's OK to sublease parts of the property or to do things like
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.080]   Airbnb in the portions of the property you're not using.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.840]   Have you found that if leases don't allow that, are landlords ever willing to negotiate
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.600]   here or if it's not allowed, kind of move on?
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   It depends on the landlord.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.680]   Now, here's the thing, being a landlord myself, and I know you've been one, if someone
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.000]   comes to me and says, hey, I'm going to pack more people into the property, my mind
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.240]   automatically goes to, OK, that's more maintenance costs, that's more wear and tear on
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.840]   the property. But now if they say, hey, we've got this unfinished basement or this
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.960]   finished basement and I'm going to rent it out long term or I'm going to put travel
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.200]   nurses in there for three months at a time, would that be OK?
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.560]   And by the way, I'll throw you an extra hundred bucks a month or two hundred bucks a
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.760]   month. I'm going to say, hey, great, I'll take that extra increased rent.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.960]   And I think if you have the conversation that way with the landlord of, hey, they're all
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.200]   being screened, they're going through a process, they're paying their own security
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.520]   deposit. I'm still going to be responsible for everything.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.760]   I think a landlord, if you have a decent conversation with them and they see the benefit
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.640]   to them of, hey, there's more money coming into that property, so there's a better
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.760]   chance all continually getting paid.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.520]   And if there's a little more upside for me, that's great.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   I mean, I have a good sort of we'll call him an Internet friend.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.040]   He was in San Diego.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.680]   His housing allowance from the military was three thousand dollars a month.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.400]   So he rented a nice big house that had a basement and he put that basement on Airbnb.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.640]   So not only was his rent about three thousand dollars, which took up his whole housing
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.640]   allowance, he was bringing in another fifteen hundred to three grand a month from that
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.840]   Airbnb place. So not only was he living for free, but then he was bringing in, you
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.680]   know, twenty five, thirty grand a year.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.120]   And he worked it out with his landlord and his landlord didn't care.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.200]   Wow, that's amazing.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.560]   OK, so you could do it if you're renting, but I know a lot of these opportunities are
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.200]   much better when you own the home.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.280]   If someone listening hasn't ever purchased a home, are there specific kind of
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.480]   requirements or prereqs that come to buying properties for these purposes that might
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.760]   change for, you know, just a traditional look for your first home or are they similar?
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.040]   Very similar. And that's the great thing about house sacking is because you're buying
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.880]   the property to live in it, you now qualify for a owner occupied loan.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.440]   So just if I were to go out and buy a house to just normally live in, I can get those
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.960]   same loan programs if I were going to house act a property.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:25.560]   Now, in some cases, there's a little extra qualification where they might ask to, you
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:31.040]   know, have you put down five percent instead of three and a half percent, but most loan
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.600]   programs out there. So if you're a veteran, there's the VA loan program.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:41.200]   You can buy a small multifamily property, a property with a walkout basement, exactly
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.160]   the same you would if you just bought a traditional single family home.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.280]   Same thing for an FHA loan.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.440]   You can buy a house three and a half percent down, you know, so for a three hundred
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.440]   thousand dollar home, you're looking at ten, eleven thousand dollars and buy a two
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.520]   unit or buy that house with that unfinished basement and then use some of your savings
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.880]   to finish that basement.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.000]   So that's the great thing with house hacking is you get to use those same owner
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.760]   occupied loans that the average homeowner is using versus if I were to go buy it as a
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.480]   true investment property, I got to put down 20 percent.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.800]   So, you know, in that three hundred thousand dollar home, I got to come up with 60
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.280]   grand to buy that, say, duplex, where if you're house hacking it, you know, you're at
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.720]   ten, five, eleven thousand.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:28.320]   Wow. And so VA loans, obviously, for for people who served in the military, who's an
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.360]   FHA loan for?
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.200]   Pretty much anyone, they want you to be a first time homebuyer or have not owned a
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.680]   home or not had an FHA loan in the past.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.320]   So it's a great option where if you're just going to go out and buy a property, use an
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.800]   FHA loan, low credit score requirement, low down payment requirement.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.760]   You don't have to have perfect credit.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.280]   And then what you get approved for is just based on your income.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.560]   Wow. And you and you said you only have to put down three and a half percent.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.440]   Yep, three and a half percent.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.360]   And then one of the really cool things when you go to buy a home and you can do this if
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.880]   you're just buying it yourself is you can negotiate with the seller to give you credits
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.240]   for closing costs.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:14.520]   So a lot of the times with those FHA loan programs, you can get credits, you can get a
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.880]   down payment assistant grant to help reduce that even lower.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.680]   Is there a limit on FHA loans?
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.400]   There is. Yeah, great question.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.480]   So the FHA loan limit is going to be based off of where you live and based off of how
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.880]   many units in the property.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:34.640]   So one thing to touch on, you know, I say small multifamily, that's up to four units.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.040]   Soon as a property has five units or more in it, it's considered commercial.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.320]   So that's why you want to stick at those four units.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:46.600]   An FHA loan program will have a max loan limit for one unit.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.160]   It increases for two unit and goes up for three and goes up for four.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.520]   So I think when I was looking a couple months back, buying a four unit there in Los
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.760]   Angeles, it was almost like a little over a million dollars was the FHA loan limit.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.360]   Now, obviously, that's a higher priced part of the country versus, say, here in
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.160]   Louisiana where I'm at in New Orleans, the FHA loan limit is not going to be as high.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:14.600]   Or if you're in a very rural part of Iowa, the loan limit is going to be a bit lower.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.640]   Yeah. Now, even if you're not eligible for FHA loan, you can still buy these as kind of
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:24.600]   traditional conventional mortgages and get a lot of the benefits of owning it by living
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.840]   in it, like property tax deduction and mortgage interest deduction and those things.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.640]   Yeah. So there's always like what I'd say the four pillars of building wealth in real
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.400]   estate. Right. So there's going to be appreciation.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:40.520]   So over the long term, if you look at the Case-Shiller Index, which looks at real
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:45.400]   estate prices over the past, I think, almost 100 years, it's appreciated on average
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.720]   three percent a year. There'll be dips, pullbacks, recessions, but you'll have that
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.960]   consistent appreciation over the long term.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.800]   You've got your debt pay down.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.680]   So you've got a loan and you'll be generating income from some part of the property.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.680]   You get your tax benefits as well from your deduction.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.480]   And then you start to build some experience as a landlord as well.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.640]   And with that comes some potential cash flow where if you're getting monthly cash flow
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:17.040]   as well, on top of all the sort of maintenance and debt required to pay for the
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.720]   property. So clearly, you've put a lot of frameworks around this.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.880]   I mentioned earlier that you have a whole podcast about this.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.800]   How did you get started in house hacking and make this your brand and fashion?
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.080]   Yeah. So it was really by accident.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.040]   So I'm 20 years old at this time back in 2002.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.240]   So I'm starting to age myself just a little bit.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.480]   But I was actually in the mortgage industry.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.640]   I was doing really well.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.120]   I started at 19, started doing sales.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.320]   I think that year I was making a little over 100 grand.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.480]   I was getting ready to go rent a place with my buddy.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.760]   And we were looking at places and it's like two bedrooms, decent places, you know, a thousand bucks a month.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.560]   And then I was like, wait, a thousand dollars a month.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.320]   I'm helping people go through loan applications and they're buying places.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:08.760]   And their payments were, you know, with taxes and insurance, eight, nine hundred bucks a month.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.960]   I was like, this doesn't make sense.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   Like, I'm going to go buy a place and then my buddy can rent a room from me.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.280]   And that's how it sort of all started, where I started with house hacking and then started growing a
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.560]   real estate portfolio and then got away from house hacking.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:28.320]   But then when me and my wife got really serious and started building our life together, we went back to house hacking.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.080]   You know, she had never owned a property.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.880]   We had just moved to New Orleans.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.680]   And I said, you know, we really love to travel.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.080]   We're paying at that time, I think we're paying like fifteen hundred dollars a month of rent.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.800]   I was like, you know, that's 20 grand a year.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.280]   Why don't we do a house hack?
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.920]   We each put in some money and find a really cool property that lets us live for free.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.640]   And then that 20 grand that we're saving, we can use for travel.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.080]   And that just sold her on it.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.440]   We ended up having this really cool property in New Orleans.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:17:00.400]   We converted it from this old corner store to three high end apartments with ADU out back.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.320]   We lived in this two bedroom, one bathroom.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.800]   And folks, let me tell you this, my wife wasn't going to live in a dump by any means.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.160]   I mean, we had like this 60 gallon soaker tub with the jacuzzi jets.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:20.240]   She had that clay fire house, farm sink thing that she really wanted, you know, 11 foot ceilings, hardwood floors.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.160]   And it was perfect for us at two bedrooms and one bathroom and saving 20 grand a year.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:35.320]   And that property also gave us an extra eight to 10 grand a year in profit on top of paying all the expenses for the property because we had so many units in it.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.760]   So it worked out phenomenal for us.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:48.040]   And that convinced her to do my fourth house hack, which we went from that two bedroom, one bathroom to now, you know, we're going to be in a three bedroom, three bathroom on our side.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.400]   So, you know, that that was sort of how I started, went on a little bit of a tangent.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.280]   We got away from a different point of life.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.800]   And then we started to get back to it just to say like, hey, you know, she had her finances, I had mine.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.160]   Let's start building our financial life together.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.200]   And house hacking is a great way to do it.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.600]   And again, you know, we didn't need a fancy car.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.640]   We'd rather just go travel and put our money towards that.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.280]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:17.400]   So I didn't know house hacking was a thing until I similarly found out that, oh, I guess I was doing it.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.840]   So our story is a little similar.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.320]   We were looking for a place in San Francisco.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:33.720]   And one of the reasons I often tell people not to buy a home is that, you know, the cost of buying and selling a home, there's real estate commissions and closing costs and everything.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:39.480]   And so the kind of general rule of thumb is if you're not going to be somewhere for five years, you probably won't recoup all those costs.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:45.240]   And when you're young, you know, you think, well, I need a place that I'll be able to live in for five years.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:51.440]   So you're kind of incentivized to buy the place that you think you would need five years from now, which might not be a one bedroom.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.240]   It might be a two bedroom or a three bedroom.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.480]   And I've always said, you know, you don't want to prepay for all that space.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:08.320]   So if in four years, you need a three bedroom place, but right now you don't, if you buy, you're going to end up paying for three bedrooms for a few years that you don't need it.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:16.280]   And so when you compare it to renting, it should be fair to compare it to, well, for two years, I'll rent a one bedroom and then two years, I'll rent a two bedroom and then I'll switch.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:27.560]   And so I often think until you're at a place where the kind of house you're renting is the same kind of size and style of what you'd need five years from now, that's a challenge.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.120]   And but we're still looking.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.560]   We're still, you know, taking, touring some open houses.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.640]   And this was probably around 2010, 2011.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.600]   And we saw this house and it was three bedrooms.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.840]   But on the ground floor, it was kind of a San Francisco style walk up, enter on the second floor.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.920]   But the ground floor had its own entrance.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:53.600]   And we thought, oh, my gosh, well, one day we might want three bedrooms, but we can't afford a home that has three bedrooms now.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:03.040]   But if we bought one and then immediately started renting it out, we could use that rental income to offset the cost of buying a house that was bigger than we needed.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:12.960]   And then at some point in the future, if we want a third bedroom, instead of selling a two bedroom house and buying a three bedroom house, we just stop renting out our, as you call it, income suite.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:28.880]   And I think something that maybe people don't realize, and this is maybe much more true in, you know, urban areas with lots of places to eat nearby, but you don't need a full kitchen suite to have an income suite.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:36.720]   We turned a bedroom with its own en suite bathroom into a rental and rented it for almost seven, eight years.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.280]   And there wasn't a kitchen in there.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.240]   And people knew that some people worked at Google and got their meals paid for.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.200]   Some people just went out to a coffee shop and some people use a microwave, a hot plate and a mini fridge.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.360]   But we were able to just turn a regular bedroom with its own entrance into a rental unit.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.760]   And that effectively covered our mortgage payment for almost seven years.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.600]   That's awesome.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.200]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:02.920]   I get it.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:08.480]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.560]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:20.000]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.040]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.880]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:31.800]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:41.360]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:48.520]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection of beer, wine and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:59.560]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.520]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.440]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.800]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.000]   You know, I think you mentioned a good point.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.640]   Like people don't always need a lot of stuff or need that full kitchen.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.200]   You know, the way I always looked at it is there's three types of tenants.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.360]   You've got your short-term tenant, you know, folks that are going to stay less than 30 days.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.400]   When people hear short-term tenants or short-term rentals, they think of like Airbnb, VRBO.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:44.640]   So a lot of times if you've got that income space that could become an income suite and it doesn't have a full kitchen or really any kitchen, I mean, you can throw in a microwave and like a kettle for some coffee or a French press or a Keurig or something like that.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.080]   Those folks, most of the time they're in a city, they want to go out and eat.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.360]   And then, you know, the next step up is a midterm tenant.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.160]   You know, those are folks that usually stay 30 days to six months.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.840]   These are, you know, traveling corporate executives.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.200]   They need a furnished place.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.760]   They don't want to be in a hotel for three months or your traveling nurse.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.360]   You know, we've rented to a lot of traveling nurses.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:15.000]   And while the place we had for those midterm tenants had a small little kitchenette, they were eating in the hospital cafeteria every time they were working.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.480]   And since they were only there for three months when they weren't working, they were out at the coffee shop.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.480]   They were out, you know, enjoying dinner at a local hotspot.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.720]   And then that third tenant base is that long term tenant that's there for 12 months.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.000]   But even then, a lot of times the longer term tenants, they don't need a lot of space.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.080]   You know, the grad student or the person like at like a Google that has all those benefits there at work.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.640]   So there's a lot of options.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.920]   And if you think through like, hey, what's the best type of house hack that fits my need?
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:49.200]   And then pair that with what's the best type of tenant base that also fits the space and what I like as well.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.880]   Yeah, I think it's interesting.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:24:02.280]   I've always been a bit turned off by rental properties as a thing to own, because I wasn't really that excited about being a full time landlord.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:20.240]   But I think I found when I was running this, I guess, income suite, you know, when it's nearby, and it's a house, you know, and understand because it's yours, where you're, you know, it's much less work than if you had a property, you know, 40 minutes away, or even 15 minutes where you've got to drive over and figure out what happens.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.080]   And so I actually found it to be a little less work than I thought.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.200]   But earlier, you said something about net profit.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:38.760]   And I think something that maybe I naively didn't think about was, anytime you're buying something that you wouldn't otherwise need for the purpose of generating income, you still have to look at it like a business.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:44.520]   And, you know, you could think that, "Oh, if I could get this much for rent, it would break even."
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:51.480]   But you might not realize it's hard to keep a place occupied 100% of the time, and there are maintenance things.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:25:03.000]   Could you walk through all the things that you would be thinking about if you were considering getting a space to rent it out, the different costs and how to make sure it really will be a good income producer?
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:13.240]   Yeah, so I'll start with maybe just an overview of what you'd want to think if it was a true investment property, and then we can sort of tie in how that relates to house hacking.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:23.360]   Because I think you should have that same mentality of, "Am I going to buy this property, just a house hack, and then sell it when I'm done, or do I want to turn it into a long-term rental?"
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:30.000]   So the place my wife and I bought in Uptown New Orleans, our goal was to turn that into a full rental property.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.840]   So that's still cash flowing, and it's great.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.320]   So first thing I look at is, what could be the gross rent?
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:45.040]   You can use a tool like Rent-A-Meter, and there's a lot of other things that will say, "Hey, here's what a one-bedroom should rent for in your city," or a three-bedroom and two-bathroom.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.720]   And then you want to look at vacancy.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.680]   So you just Google your city and average vacancy rate, it's going to come up.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:59.920]   But what you want to think about is, even if a tenant moves out on day one, you're going to have to clean it, you're going to have to do some stuff, and you start marketing it.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.720]   There's very few tenants that want to move in the next day.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.680]   So you got to figure it's going to be empty for at least a week, if not a month.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:16.560]   So figure out vacancy, plan to have it empty two to four weeks out of a year, if a tenant's turning over every year.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.720]   You want to look at what's called maintenance.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   So this is little things like, "Hey, the thermostat's not working.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.520]   I got to call the HVAC guy," or, "The fridge went out," little things like that.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.320]   Then you want to look at CapEx.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.760]   So CapEx is a big capital expenditure.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.640]   It's like the roof.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.080]   When's the roof going to go out?
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:41.680]   So you can say, "Hey, my roof's going to cost 20 grand to replace, and it's due in 10 years.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.960]   I should be setting aside two grand a year over the next 10 years so I can afford it."
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:57.360]   And so you can figure out some of the bigger things on your house, and then back those out over a period of a year to figure out how much you'd be setting aside.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:02.480]   The rule of thumb for maintenance is to set aside 5% to 10% of your gross rent.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:14.560]   So if you're renting a duplex and you're getting $1,500 for each side, $3,000 a month, you're going to want to set aside about $150 to $250 a month.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.640]   Some months, you'll never have maintenance.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.840]   And then other months, all of a sudden, the fridge goes out, can't be fixed.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.000]   You got to buy a brand new fridge, a thousand bucks.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.760]   And then you're just going to want to look at any what I call miscellaneous stuff.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.840]   Utilities, do I got to do trash, lawn care, shoveling snow, things like that.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.440]   A lot of that you can do yourself, or you can hire it out if you don't want to.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.600]   And then the last thing to think about is property management.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.400]   So do I actually want to manage the tenants?
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:48.320]   If they're on the other side of the property or they're in my finished basement, maybe I don't mind doing it.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.880]   Or, "Hey, I want a house I can not deal with anyone.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.120]   Let me hire a property manager."
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:57.520]   Property manager is going to take 8% to 10% of those gross rents.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:03.120]   So if you've got a place that's running for $1,500, figure a property manager is going to take,
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.800]   on average, about $150 of that.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:12.880]   So you look at those expenses of a rental, and then you should do that for a house act, but say,
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:18.240]   "Great, well, if I'm living in one part, what should this part rent for?
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.880]   Okay, so I should be thinking about that for setting aside for maintenance.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.680]   I should be thinking about what the big things are for CapEx, setting those aside.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.480]   Obviously, there's not going to be vacancy on my side.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.120]   There will be on the tenants portion."
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.440]   And then you can sort of look at that and say, "Great.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:40.480]   How is that working out compared to what the mortgage is?"
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.960]   And then the other thing I think about is housing savings.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:49.120]   So when me and my wife moved to New Orleans, the place we were renting was like $1,500 a month.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:53.120]   So we realized, "Hey, we could go into this house act,
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.680]   and we could bring in enough income to cover all the mortgage.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.240]   And if we rented out the ADU, we'd have an upside."
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.760]   But we looked at it of, "Great, so we're breaking even.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:09.520]   We're covering the mortgage taxes and insurance, but now all of a sudden that's breaking us even,
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.320]   but we're saving $1,500 a month from what we were previously paying.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.760]   So there's that savings there."
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.800]   So we said, "Great.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.360]   If we are saving $1,500 a month, let's put aside $500 for maintenance and CapEx.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:28.560]   And then if our outbuilding, our ADU guest house, anything we get above that is the gravy money."
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:33.440]   So in that situation, we went from renting, paying $20,000 a year,
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:38.000]   to living in the house act, saving $20,000 a year from not paying rent,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.520]   plus having an extra $8,000 to $10,000 a month on top of that,
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.960]   on top of paying all of that mortgage taxes and insurance.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:52.560]   So that's a long way to think about how to look at a house hack and then how to think about
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:57.840]   analyzing a rental property, all the fees you need to think about that could be in there.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:04.080]   Is there any kind of ratio of average rent to average purchase price to get a sense of like,
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.720]   "Is this a good place to... Whether it's a rental property or a house hack to do it?"
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.800]   Yeah. So there used to be this old rule of thumb called the 1% rule.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.760]   And I look at this as just, it's back to the napkin rule of thumb. So if you're buying a
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:25.600]   place for 100,000, it should rent for 1%, 1,000 a month. In very high cost of living areas,
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:31.280]   that just doesn't work very well. And again, that's just a rule of thumb. I use that as,
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.840]   "Hey, a realtor sent me a deal. They think it'll be a good rental property."
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:42.240]   I can really quickly look and say, "Does it meet the 1% rule? Is it close to it? If so,
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:47.360]   then I'll go spend the time of walking through the property." It's just tough to see if it will
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:52.480]   actually work in a place like a San Francisco or a New York City. Most of the other parts of the
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.440]   country, it's a nice little rule of thumb to use. But again, it's just that. It's just a rule of
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:05.040]   thumb. Yeah. That makes sense. And as much as I enjoyed being a landlord from the income producing
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.440]   side, you mentioned a property manager and that was something that I never considered.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.560]   But does that include all the maintenance issues? Is hiring a property manager going to mean that
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.480]   at midnight, if the sink stops up, I'm not getting the phone call?
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:25.840]   Yeah. So a property manager is really going to do three areas, right? We're going to take over the
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:31.040]   property in the sense of here's the rental unit. They're going to market it. They're going to find
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:36.560]   tenants. They're going to screen tenants, make sure credit background check. They're going to
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:41.600]   price the unit. And then when they find a good applicant, they're going to go through signing
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.920]   a lease and they're going to put the tenant in it. So sort of that first piece of property
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:52.000]   management does is market and fill the unit. The second piece they do is manage the property
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.120]   ongoing. So if that tenant calls at two in the morning and says, "The toilet's broken and backed
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:02.240]   up," or, "The sink won't stop running," they're going to be calling the property management
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:08.000]   company, not you. And then the property management company is going to send out a maintenance person.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.840]   Now, their fee won't cover the maintenance cost, that service cost. So if the plumber sends them
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:20.000]   a bill for 250, they're going to pass that bill on to you to pay. But they're managing that process,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.720]   which is pretty nice because a lot of times when stuff seems to go wrong with the property,
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.120]   it goes wrong when you're traveling or you're at work in a meeting and can't get your phone.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:33.520]   So it's great to have the property management take care of that. So they sort of do that
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:40.000]   ongoing management. And then the third piece that the property management will take care of is what
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.800]   I call the lease renewal or turnover. So the tenant signed a one-year lease, the lease is
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:52.240]   getting ready to expire in 45 days. The property management company is going to reach out to them,
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:58.400]   ask them to re-sign a lease. They'll go through that re-signing process, update the lease,
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.360]   re-verify any information. Or if they're going to move out, they'll go through the whole move
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:09.120]   out process, getting the property cleaned back up and ready to go back into that first phase
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:14.320]   of remarketing and filling it. I always say for new folks, you should manage your property for
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.840]   at least the first year just so you understand the process and then turn it over to a property
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.800]   manager. It'll make you more effective at working with a property manager because you'll understand
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   what they're doing. But again, if you're that person that says, "Look, I'd love the house act.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:33.120]   I just don't ever want to deal with the tenants." There's a lot of folks that will
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:38.720]   tell the tenants that they're just a renter also and the property manager takes care of it and they
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:44.160]   don't know who the owner is. So there's a lot of different ways you can approach it. But property
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.560]   management is a great, great way to go if you want to be hands-off as possible. That's amazing.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:53.040]   I love the idea of not telling the other person that you're the owner. So you can kind of be,
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.240]   "Oh, that terrible owner. This thing's always clogging up."
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:02.800]   I want to jump back to a couple of the types of house hacking. And one in particular
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:08.400]   is ADUs. And if I run through them again, it's kind of obvious. Room rental,
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:13.040]   renting and having roommates makes sense. Buying a duplex, turning something in the house,
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.280]   whether it's a basement, an attic, or an extra bedroom that has an entrance into an income suite.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.200]   But ADUs are interesting because I don't know a lot about them.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:26.560]   Is this something where it's easy to just build one on your property? Do you need permits?
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:34.160]   So the thing I love about an ADU is right now, the multifamily market is so hot. If you try to
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:40.400]   find a duplex or a triplex, they go really quick because so many people want to be in real estate.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:46.400]   But if you look at properties that have that detached building, you're just going to be
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.600]   competing with the average homebuyer. And then a lot of folks nowadays, when you've got homes,
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:56.560]   they like the garage actually attached to the building. So it's a really easy way to find a
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:01.520]   property to house hack. You specifically look for those detached buildings. And then what you can do
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:08.240]   is if the building's existing, it's pretty easy to get it converted. You do need to get some permits
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:14.720]   if you got to run new electrical and plumbing to it. Luckily with the ADU, we had plumbing and
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:20.400]   electrical lines were already ran out there. And we were able to keep a one-car garage and then
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.360]   convert it into this two-story loft. So it just sort of depends on that side. If it's an existing
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:31.120]   building, it's a lot easier. Now, if you have the space to build a building, that's going to be a
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:37.200]   little bit more challenging. So one of the things down in LA that they did is there's obviously a
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.880]   housing problem. So one of the ways to solve a housing problem is you allow more density in
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:49.360]   housing. So they actually pass laws to let people start to build ADUs because they said, "Hey,
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:54.880]   this is an easy way to add more rental units. Let someone build an accessory dwelling unit."
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.040]   So you can actually go through the process of having plans drawn up, building a brand new
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:06.240]   building and making that guest house, outside building rental. And it's a pretty cool process
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.640]   because you can customize it. I'll send you for your show notes. We actually interviewed a
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:17.600]   designer and builder that builds ADUs. That's all he specializes in. And he has some really,
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.320]   really cool knowledge about how to build a smaller space, make it really more effective.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:27.920]   And he works specifically in California, but it was a phenomenal episode. And he talks about going
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.920]   through the zoning and building permitting process. But it's one of those phenomenal
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:37.840]   things that you can do where you can build an ADU. And while maybe you live in the ADU and
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:42.480]   you rent the big house when you're young and you're single, or maybe you're just a young couple.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.760]   And then once you start a family, move into the bigger building and now rent the ADU.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:53.360]   You can rent the ADU on Airbnb. You can rent it to travel nurses. You can do a long-term tenant.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.680]   And then as your life changes and you've got that teenager and you don't want them in the house
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:04.320]   because they're moody and they hate mom and dad, put them out in that ADU. And now the ADU can just
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:10.080]   be this really cool way of how you can live in that property. And over a 10 or 15-year period,
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:15.760]   that property can transition with you through life by starting the smaller unit and renting
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.960]   the bigger unit and then switching. And then it's just a cool way to have it work with you
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:28.880]   through life. It sounds like a great idea if you have the space. How much ballpark does it cost to
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:36.560]   build an ADU on your land? I think $40,000 to $75,000, just depending where you're at in the
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:41.760]   country, any permitting fees that are out there, and how big you want to make it. Obviously,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:47.760]   if you're trying to make a three-bedroom ADU completely from scratch, they got to pour a
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:53.520]   foundation. Our ADU, because it was this old existing barn building, the frame was there.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:59.840]   It had a roof on it. We had to replace the roof. The windows were good. We had to do new siding.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:07.280]   But we probably spent $25,000 on our ADU. And right now, we have travel nurses in it at $1,000
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:15.120]   a month. So if you're looking at just a basic ROI, even if we spent $40,000 on it, that's bringing
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:21.520]   in $12,000 a year, simple ROI, you're making a really good return there. And I assume when you
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.600]   turn around, if you ever sell that property, the value of that property goes up as well.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.720]   It's not just extra income, but the whole value goes up.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:35.120]   Yep. Now, an ADU isn't valued the exact same way as the main building. But because it's a
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:41.040]   heated and cooled conditioned space, it does drastically increase the value of the property.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.160]   Can the cost that you need to build an ADU, can you add that to your mortgage?
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:51.360]   Is there a way to build it if you don't have the $40,000, $70,000 in cash?
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:57.760]   Yeah. So a lot of people, they'll get a first mortgage and then they'll say, "Hey, great. We're
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.240]   buying this property. There's a garage building on there. We know we want to convert it or their
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:08.880]   space and our city and county will let us build it." So they'll either use savings or if they've
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.800]   got... Say they've been living in the property and like, "Hey, we can actually do this." A lot
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   of folks will use an equity line. So they'll get that second mortgage equity line on their property
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:24.240]   and they'll get that equity line for $50,000 and use that to pay for that building.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:29.360]   And then once the building's done, the value of the property is increased. They refinance
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.080]   and pay off that equity line or second mortgage. And now they've just got the one flat rate,
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:39.040]   low payment mortgage. And then you've got that higher appraised value to do that.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:46.560]   Yeah. One thing we didn't talk about much, when you said the straight cost,
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:52.320]   you just get $1,000 a month, that's $12,000 a year. How do taxes play into house hacking?
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.240]   And I know neither of us are CPAs, but we'd love your...
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:04.640]   Disclaimer. Yeah. So you're definitely going to want to work with an accountant. A good accountant
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:10.240]   is going to save you more money than they cost. So one of the things when you look at a property,
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:16.640]   the house hack, when you're living in it, let's just say, I'll use our property we had in Uptown,
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:22.640]   three units in the main building, and then we had an ADU. We were living in roughly 25% of the
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:30.720]   building. So what our accountant did is say, "Great. The other 75% of the property is considered
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:38.160]   rental property." That was generating X amount in gross rent. We could back out 75% of our mortgage,
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:44.880]   75% of our taxes, 75% of the utility bills for the property. We paid all the exterior lights.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:50.000]   Any maintenance costs were deducted from those gross rents that we are collected.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.480]   And then what was left, we had depreciation. And this is one of the big wealth builders for
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:02.960]   depreciation is... I'll try to oversimplify this. Depreciation, the IRS says, "Let's take the value
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:10.320]   of the property, divide it by 27 and a half years, and that gives you a depreciated value where the
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:16.880]   value of the property should be less each year." So with our Uptown property, we had about $16,000
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:23.920]   to $18,000 in depreciation a year, and that was essentially wiping out all of our gain.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:30.320]   And I'm doing air quotes for folks that are only listening. So we ended up paying zero taxes
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:36.960]   on all that extra income we had after paying all of the expenses. And that's why so many
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:42.480]   millionaires and multi-millionaires own real estate is because it's such an incredibly wealth
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:49.440]   building tool. You've got that tax benefit, you've got the appreciation, the tenants are paying down
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:54.960]   the mortgage, which is essentially like a forced savings account for you. And then you're getting
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:42:00.720]   the cash flow as well. So it's a beautiful, beautiful way to build wealth. Yeah. The one
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:05.760]   thing you just said, the forced savings vehicle, I think is a really important point to hit on.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:11.200]   Because when we were in San Francisco, we had an apartment and the rent was covering the mortgage
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.600]   payment. And I often had people say, "Well, what about the property tax?" I said, "Okay. Well,
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:21.200]   it didn't cover all of that. But the mortgage payment was paying down the house." And so
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.680]   I was thinking, "Okay. Well, I'm actually able when we sell the house to recoup a lot of the
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:34.560]   equity value I've put in." So if you're looking at these costs, in some ways, you could say,
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:41.360]   "As long as the amount I'm making covers all of my expenses, the property tax, the maintenance."
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:45.520]   And it doesn't actually have to cover your whole mortgage. Even if it just covers the
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:50.960]   interest portion of the mortgage, that's all of your outlay. Because the way I like to think
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.000]   about it is every dollar you put towards the principal of your home, that's a dollar you get
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.600]   back later in life. Obviously, it's possible that home value doesn't go up. But in general,
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:04.880]   like you said, in the long run, all your principal payments are coming back to you when you sell the
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.800]   house. So you don't have to cover the whole mortgage for this to still be a good deal.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.680]   Well, just since we've been talking about our property in Uptown, the tenants are paying down
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:22.560]   the mortgage, which is putting about $10,000 to $11,000 here in 2021, paying down on the principal.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:28.960]   That's 11 grand that our net worth is increasing on top of the cashflow, on top of the appreciation.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.520]   And I love real estate for so many reasons, but let's say the property never appreciates. Let's
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:38.720]   just say it always stays flat. You're still going to have equity growth because of that principal
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:44.160]   pay down. So if the property stays flat, you win. If the property value goes up, you win.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:50.240]   If the property value goes down and only stays down, you lose. But most likely what's going to
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.800]   happen if you're looking at a longer hold period, it'll go down and then it'll go back up. So
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:00.240]   there's just so many ways to benefit from real estate investing. And house hacking is this great
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.960]   tool to get your foot in the door to do broader real estate investing. But if you never want to
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:11.520]   be a real estate investor, just use house hacking as an amazing life hack. Use it for three, four,
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:16.960]   five years to get ahead financially, to pay down your student loans, to pay down the credit cards
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.600]   that you ran up. Maybe you're just having your first child and say, "Hey, we can live in a small
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:29.840]   two-bedroom for four or five years." Use that savings to max out a bunch of money into a 529
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.160]   plan for your child and then stop putting money in. And when they're ready for college, there'll
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:40.240]   be plenty of money in there for them. It's a really amazing hack that you can use as long
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:45.040]   as you want or as short as you want. Or like you said, take it and travel.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:49.360]   Something we both love doing. I just want to thank you,
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:54.720]   Quick, for listening to and supporting the show. Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.080]   Over the years, it sounds like you've bought and sold quite a few properties.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:17.360]   I know not everyone here is thinking about house hacking, but many people are thinking about
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:22.400]   buying homes or selling homes. Are there hacks or tips or tricks you'd give people, whether it's
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:27.040]   for a house hack, a rental property, or a primary residence when you're looking for a house or
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.560]   selling a house to keep in mind that not everyone knows about?
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:37.760]   Yeah. So on the buying side, I would say look for the problems. Look for the ugly houses. If
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:42.640]   you can find the ugliest house in the best neighborhood, you can go in and spend time
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:48.320]   to fix it up. If you put in a little bit of TLC, a little bit of love, you can end up with a great
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:54.240]   deal. And then you can really customize the house. I love when I see pictures online of houses and
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:59.440]   they've got the pink tubs and the pink tiles that are from the '70s, because to me that says,
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:05.200]   "Hey, this is awesome. I can customize that bathroom and bring it up to date."
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:09.760]   And that's really going to increase the value where the average homeowner might walk through
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:14.160]   and be like, "Oh my goodness, this is a horrible bathroom. I would never live here." And they go
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:19.920]   out. I love smelly houses as well because the average person doesn't want to deal with the
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:25.680]   smelly house. Me, I think a smelly house, I'm like, "This is awesome." I get a smile on my face
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:32.400]   when the realtor's like, "It's gross." Because you rip out all the carpet, you wash everything
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:37.760]   down with this cleaner called TSP, you run a no-zone machine, and that kills the smell.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   And then you do a kill paint sealer on everything, and then you put it back together. So I look for
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:49.440]   the things that the average homeowner doesn't want to deal with. I also like when I go look
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:56.320]   on like realtor.com or Redfin, I do the reverse search. So usually I say, "Hey, this property just
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:00.720]   came on two hours ago." Everyone's looking at that one. I say, "Show me the property that's
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:06.480]   been on the longest," because that person is probably willing to negotiate and willing to
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:11.840]   cut their price. And then the other thing when you're buying a property, it's sometimes hard
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:17.760]   to do in a really hot market, but ask the seller to pay a portion of the closing costs. They can
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:23.200]   give you a seller credit or a seller concession, and that can just reduce your cash to closing.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:30.720]   So even if you've got 20, 30, 50 grand saved up, closing costs can easily run you depending
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.280]   where you're at in the country, eight to 10 grand. So if you can get the seller to pay part of that,
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:42.000]   look at that as a lever. So maybe they, for whatever reason, they have to have a five,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.240]   they've got to sell their house for $500,000. So say, "Great, I'll give you that $500,000.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:55.360]   But can you give me $7,000 in closing costs credit?" And a lot of times folks will say yes
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:02.000]   to that, but they won't say yes to a $493,000 sales price. So look at the different levers
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.640]   that you can pull and a good realtor can help you with those. Yeah. For the house we just purchased
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:13.280]   last year, there were a handful of things that were just part of the staging. And we were like,
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:19.040]   "We just really like this TV. It's already mounted to the wall. It's exactly where we'd want it.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:23.600]   We really like these lime trees that were all around the yard that weren't part of the yard
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:28.080]   because they were staged plants." And we were like, "We'll do this deal. But can you just
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:34.880]   throw in a long list of things?" And especially these things that have prices that are unknown,
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.640]   but relative to the cost of the house, everyone knows they're pretty small.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:45.200]   The sellers were willing to flex, but they were not willing to flex on the price. So
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:50.480]   I love this idea of just finding all the ways that you can get something out of the deal that
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.360]   aren't the price. Yep. Because yeah, so many people,
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:58.720]   they mentally get stuck on this idea of like, "I need this certain price," because they'll feel
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:04.800]   good about it. And maybe the lime trees were only $200 a lime tree, or maybe they were $1,000 a
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.960]   lime tree. But to them, it's like, "Oh, it's a little lime tree in a pot. Great. I'm getting
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:13.200]   my number." So yeah, flex on that. So those are a couple of things on the buy side.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:18.560]   If you're getting ready to sell a property, deep clean your property and then bring someone in to
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:24.880]   help stage it or declutter it. I'm really big on, I know what I'm good at, and it's worth spending
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:30.080]   money on experts. One of my early real estate mentors, he goes, "Andrew, if you ever get in
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:36.720]   financial trouble with tenants over leases or potential lawsuits or negotiation issues,
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:42.320]   figure out the best lawyer you think you can hire and then go hire someone better. It'll pay off."
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:48.400]   And I'm that same way. If I'm going to sell a property, I'm not going to try to skimp. I don't
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:53.440]   want the realtor that's going to cut a quarter percent off or a half percent off and then miss
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:58.240]   out on the realtor that's the rockstar that has the giant team, has the giant network.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:04.080]   I feel like I'm okay with design. My wife is even better. But even with that, this is stuff that
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:08.880]   we're emotionally attached to. I want someone else to come in and say, "Hey, you need to declutter
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:15.200]   this stuff. You need to remove that. It's to your taste. It's not common enough or generic enough
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.320]   that it's going to appeal to everyone." So I always say bring cleaners in to do a deep clean
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:25.600]   and then bring someone in to help declutter. And even if you're keeping your stuff in there while
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:30.880]   it's being sold, have someone help stage it and rearrange it. Maybe you've got the living room
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:35.520]   laid out where it's perfect for y'all for sitting at the TV and it's comfortable and you've got all
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:42.080]   the extra pillows on it and throw rugs and all sorts of weird stuff. But for the person coming
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:46.560]   in, the layout might seem a little funkier or might not flow as enough or might not make the
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:51.680]   house present as well. So to me, that curb appeal and that presentation on the inside
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:58.080]   really do go a long way. Yeah. We paid a premium for good staging when we sold our
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:03.920]   San Francisco apartment. And I regretted it for the first week and then the house sold in a week
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:09.600]   and I did not regret it. And I think it's tough because like you said, your style isn't always
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:14.800]   the style that sells. And when you hire someone that's been doing this a lot, they know the style
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:20.080]   that sells. And they designed the house in a way that I was like, "I wouldn't want to live here."
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:25.520]   But it's what everyone wanted. So I really like that advice. The only thing I'll add,
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:30.400]   my brother-in-law gave me this advice is when you're buying, whether it's through the real
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:35.760]   estate agent or if you can somehow get in touch with the sellers, if you can find out what the
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:41.520]   priority is. Some people want to sell fast. Some people want the highest number. There's always
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:48.240]   one lever. And if you identify that someone wants to get the highest offer, well then you don't
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:52.240]   necessarily need to worry as much about how quickly you can close. And maybe you could put
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:57.600]   in some contingencies, maybe not in today's market. But if you find out that someone just cares about
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:04.480]   closing as fast as possible, then you can put in a time to close. And the advice that he gave me,
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:11.840]   which I will caveat this with, it's certainly a risky move, was you can always... It's easier to
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:16.960]   extend an offer that's been accepted than it is to ask for longer time upfront. So he said,
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:22.080]   "We guarantee a 15-day close." And I asked him, "How long did the bank say they could close?"
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:27.680]   And he's like, "Oh, they said 21." But I figured that once we're 15 days in, if I need seven more
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:32.080]   days, they'd rather give it to me than start the whole process over again and look for another
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.840]   person. It's like, "Well, we're already almost all the way through with them, so let's give them
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:40.880]   a little bit more." So you mentioned hiring the best lawyer you can and then upgrading that if
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:45.520]   you have financial trouble with tenants. I'll just ask, you've had a lot of tenants. Have you had any
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:52.960]   fun stories or terrible things or interesting tales? So my original investing career was very
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:59.680]   focused on affordable housing and what I would call student housing, college housing by universities
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:06.160]   back in North Carolina. The affordable housing, I did a lot of aid work overseas, worked in places
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:13.280]   like Indonesia, Philippines, Kenya, Haiti. So this idea of community development in very challenging
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:18.800]   places, coming back to where I lived, I was like, "Oh, this is nothing." So I did a lot of affordable
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:24.640]   housing and I wouldn't recommend affordable housing for anyone that's new, but it was a great way to
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:31.120]   get started. I mean, I had a property where I was under contract on it and the SWAT team raided the
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:36.640]   apartment. So I think that would probably freak out most people. What happened to me was I'm
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:42.480]   getting a better discount. So I mean, literally they came in, they knocked the doors off one of
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:47.440]   the rental units. This was a fourplex that I was buying and folks in the top unit were selling some
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:52.400]   drugs. I knew it was a bad area. I was planning on clearing out the unit. But to me, that was
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:57.520]   automatically like, "This is a problem and a challenge. There's upside for me." So I went back
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:04.800]   to the owner and I said, "Look, hey, this building," I pretended to be nervous and scared and, "Oh my
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.440]   goodness, this is so horrible. I didn't know this was going on." And we negotiated the price down
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:14.000]   lower. But from my standpoint, it was like, "Well, I was going to put new doors on all the units. I
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.360]   wanted to get rid of that tenant anyways." So that just sort of solved that problem and I could use
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:26.480]   that as a negotiating tool. And then also in that affordable housing, I unfortunately had to do a
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:32.480]   lot of evictions. I think I probably did 20, 25 evictions. I did them all myself, except for one
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:38.960]   where the tenant appealed and then we had to go to a higher level court. And at that level,
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:45.840]   I brought in a lawyer. But the reason I won all of them was because I used leases.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:50.480]   So even if you're going to house hack and you're bringing in a friend to live in a room, get a
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:56.640]   lease and make sure to follow everything in that lease. So I had great leases. And if a tenant was
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:01.760]   late, I would deliver the notice. And if they still hadn't paid, then we'd file in court and
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:07.520]   they'd come to court and they'd complain and say, "Oh, this and that," or, "He's a bad guy." And
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:11.680]   the judge will say, "Well, he brought you to court for not paying and he delivered the notice. And
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:16.240]   here's proof that I delivered the notice. Okay, why didn't you pay? Okay, great. Well, he wins."
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:21.920]   So if you have good leases, if something does come up in a worst-case scenario,
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.880]   having all that stuff in writing is super valuable to have.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:31.040]   It's easy when you're house hacking and it feels a little less professional than running a rental
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:36.880]   property to let things get a little casual. I remember we had a friend of a friend looking
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:42.160]   for a place and we didn't take a security deposit because we were like, "Oh, it's just a friend."
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:46.720]   And then one day before they were supposed to move in, they backed out and we couldn't find
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:51.280]   a tenant on a day's notice. So we had about a month's worth of rent that ended up getting lost.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:57.280]   And it was just a learning moment for me. So my takeaway now is find a place that's smelly,
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:01.760]   that has a pink bathtub, and ideally that the SWOT team has recently rated.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.920]   Yes, yes, yes. If you find those 3, that's the trifecta. You're going to get a great
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:11.520]   deal on the property. That's amazing. So right now is definitely a hot,
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:16.240]   hot real estate market across the country. Does that make house hacking more appealing,
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:21.520]   less appealing? Any tips to take advantage of it? Yeah. So I'd say it can be both.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:29.840]   Rents have gone up across the country. Obviously, there was in some areas last year due to COVID,
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:33.280]   where rental prices went down in major cities. But if you look at it,
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:40.320]   it's rebounding all across the country. If you're paying 30% or 40% of your income towards rent,
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:46.320]   and you're not getting ahead financially, if you're making 20 grand a month and you're spending
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:52.400]   eight grand on your housing and you've got five grand left over to put towards investments,
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:57.440]   cool. You're probably in a good spot. But for most folks, housing's taking up so much,
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.880]   it's not letting them pay down debt or put money away for investment.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:06.640]   So to me, I'd say, yes, you should really look at house hacking. And then in any market,
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:11.680]   there's going to be assets that are overvalued and there's going to be assets that are undervalued.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:17.040]   And that's the same thing in real estate. You just got to go out and look at that property,
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:22.640]   that asset that's being undervalued for whatever reason, and then use that as a good property to
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:28.480]   house hack. So you get a lot of upside while reducing your housing costs. So even if there
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:35.680]   is a housing correction in the next two years and housing drops 10% or 15%, or say even 20%,
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:42.320]   but if you bought that property that was undervalued by 10% or 15%, and then you're
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:48.480]   able to go in and buy it and do some work to then increase it 10% or 15%. So even if there is that
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:53.280]   drop in two years, you're still going to be coming out pretty even if you can hold it for another
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:58.240]   year or two. And one other tip maybe I'll throw in here is in a hot market, if you think a property
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:02.960]   is good and there's multiple offers, you can do something called an escalation clause, where
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:09.760]   basically says, "Here's my offer. If someone else comes in higher, you actually have to show me that
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:17.440]   offer, but my offer will automatically beat that offer by $1,000 or $2,000 or 5,000." And basically
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:23.120]   your offer will automatically escalate up into a cap. So maybe you want to buy this property for
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:29.120]   300 grand. You'll say, "Great. Here's what my offer is. I know the property still works
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:36.880]   up to 310,000. So I'm going to add an escalation clause for $2,500 will automatically go up in a
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:44.960]   $2,500 increment above any other offer at that cap." So that's a great way to get a property.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:49.200]   You just got to be careful because some people will get emotional about a property and then
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:55.760]   overpay. But if you can find that undervalued asset, it's a great way to get into real estate,
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:59:00.320]   whether you're going to house hack or not. But I definitely think house hacking works in any
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:05.120]   market. And right now with housing so expensive and rent so expensive, it's a good tool to get
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:09.920]   ahead financially. Absolutely. I think most people aren't out there looking to house hack.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:16.800]   So I know when we looked at places, having an ADU, having an income suite, especially when
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.880]   they're not labeled as such. When we were in San Francisco, it was a third bedroom with a
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:25.440]   second entrance. It wasn't marketed as an income suite. So being able to spot that,
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:30.960]   it wasn't charging a premium over other three bedrooms. So keep in mind as you're walking
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:35.920]   through a place, "Could we convert this to a rental? Could we make this an in-law unit?
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:39.760]   Could we build an ADU here?" And you might be able to get yourself a really good deal.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:43.440]   Yeah. Well, the way most places with basements are marketed, it's like, "Oh,
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:49.520]   basement for kids or for the man cave." And someone's paying extra for that space
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:54.400]   when they might not need it. Where for us, we don't mind paying a little extra for that space
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:58.320]   because it can become a rental unit. So yeah, you just got to be open and creative and look
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:03.440]   for those hidden gems for properties. Awesome. This has been so fantastic.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:07.760]   There will be a lot of links in the show notes that you guys have a guide about house hacking,
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:12.400]   your podcast, a couple of the episodes you mentioned. Where can people find you and all
