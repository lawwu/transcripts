[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   The real foundation of Marx's political philosophy
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.600]   was the economic argument that there would be a tendency
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.140]   for the rate of profit to fall.
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.040]   And that tendency for the rate of profit to fall
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.480]   would lead to capitalists battening down workers harder,
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.860]   paying them less than their subsistence,
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.120]   a revolt by workers against this,
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.840]   and then you would get socialism on the other side.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.000]   So what he called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.280]   played a critical role in his explanation
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.160]   for why socialism would have to come about.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.160]   If you look at Marx's own vision of the revolution,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.720]   it was gonna happen in England.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.600]   The advanced economies would be first
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.220]   to go through the revolution.
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.340]   The socialist, the primitive economies
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.680]   would have to go through a capitalist transition.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.520]   And this is the difference
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.040]   when the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.040]   So the Mensheviks,
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.600]   and Hyman Minsky came out of the Menshevik family,
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.980]   the Mensheviks believed you had to go
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.480]   through a capitalist phase.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.240]   Russia had to go through a capitalist period
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.880]   before it becomes socialist.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.640]   The Bolsheviks believed they could get there in one go.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.240]   - The following is a conversation with Steve Keen,
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.120]   a brilliant economist that criticizes
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.680]   much of modern economics
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.060]   and proposes new theories and models
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.640]   that integrate some ideas and ditch others
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.760]   from very thinkers from Karl Marx to John Maynard Keynes
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.480]   to Hyman Minsky.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.040]   In fact, a lot of our conversation is about Karl Marx
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.840]   and Marxian economics.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.240]   He has been a scholar of Karl Marx's work for many years.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.360]   So this was a fascinating exploration.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.560]   He has written several books I recommend,
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.280]   including "The New Economics Manifesto"
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.640]   and "Debunking Economics."
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.600]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.580]   To support it,
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.240]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.380]   And now, dear friends, here's Steve Keen.
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.320]   Let's start with a big question.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.800]   What is economics?
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.040]   Or maybe what is or should be the goal of economics?
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.040]   - Well, it should be I understand
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.800]   how human civilization comes about
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.240]   and how it can be maintained.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.040]   And that's not what it's been at all.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.760]   So we have a discipline which has the right name
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.200]   and the wrong soul.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.680]   - What is the soul of economics?
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.840]   - The soul of economics really is to explain
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.320]   how do we manage to build a civilization
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   that elevates us so far above the energy and consumption
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   and knowledge levels of the base environment of the earth?
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.120]   'Cause if you think about,
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.320]   and this is actually a work I've learned from Tim Garrett,
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.160]   who's one of my research colleagues
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.800]   as an atmospheric physicist.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.520]   And his idea is that we exploit
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.040]   these high-grade energy sources
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.760]   from the sun itself to coal, nuclear, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.720]   which means we can maintain a level of human civilization
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.640]   well above what we'd have if we were just still running
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.240]   around with rocks and stones and spears.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.920]   So it's that elevation above the base level of the planet,
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.800]   which is human civilization.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.560]   And if we didn't have this energy we were exploiting,
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.800]   if we didn't use the environment to elevate ourselves
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.200]   above what's possible in the background,
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.280]   then you and I wouldn't be talking into microphones.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.400]   We might be doing drumbeats and stuff like this,
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.560]   but we wouldn't be having the sort of conversation we have.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.960]   So it would explain how that came about,
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.200]   that was the economics should be doing and it's not.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.560]   - So this is the greatest thing
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.600]   that the earth has ever created
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.440]   is what you're saying in this conversation?
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.920]   - Yeah, we're the most elaborate construction on the planet.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.360]   And that's not what we've done,
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.600]   we've denigrated the planet itself.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.080]   We don't have respect for the fact that life itself
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.480]   is an incredible creation.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.080]   And my ultimate, if I had to say how humanity's
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.440]   gonna survive what we're putting ourselves through,
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.160]   then we'd have to come out of it as a species
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.400]   which sees its role as preserving and respecting life.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.440]   - I like how you took my silly, incredible statement
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.440]   and made it into a serious one about how amazing life is.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.160]   - Life is incredible and we humans don't respect it enough,
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.400]   we trash it.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.640]   And that's what's economics,
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.360]   I think it's played a huge role in that.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.320]   So I actually regard my discipline,
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.360]   I would never call it a profession, let alone a science.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.840]   My discipline has probably helped bring about
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.440]   the termination potential,
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.960]   the feasible termination of human civilization.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.840]   - Strong words.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.000]   Okay, let's return to the basics of economics.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So what is the soul and the practice of economics?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.360]   What should be the goal of it?
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.000]   Because you're speaking very poetically,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.400]   but we'll also speak pragmatically
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.920]   about the tools of economics, the variables of economics,
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.760]   the metrics, the goals, the models.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.480]   Practically speaking, what are the goals of economics?
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.000]   - Well, in terms of the tools we use,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.840]   we should be using the tools that engineers use, frankly.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.200]   And that sounds ridiculously simple
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.320]   because you would expect that economists
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.360]   are using up-to-date techniques
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.800]   that are common in other sciences
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.880]   where you're dealing with similar ideas of stocks and flows
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.080]   and interactions between the environment
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.680]   and a system and so on.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.000]   And that's fundamentally systems engineering.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.480]   And that's what we should be using
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.040]   as the tools of economics.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.640]   Now, if you look at what economists actually do,
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.360]   the sophisticated stuff involves difference equations.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.800]   And difference equations,
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.120]   if you've done enough mathematics as you have,
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.640]   you know difference equations are useful
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.800]   for individual-level processes.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.160]   If you're talking about autonomous,
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.440]   it'll go from state T to T plus one, T plus two, and so on.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.280]   But not when you're talking at the aggregate level.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.040]   There you use differential equations to measure it all.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.520]   Economists have been using difference equations.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.640]   So there's a book, I think it's by Sargent and one other,
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.080]   called Advanced Methods in Economics Using Python,
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.640]   two-volume set.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.160]   It's about close to 2,000 pages,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.680]   and four of those pages are on differential equations.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.960]   The rest is all difference equations.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.720]   So they're using entirely the wrong mathematics
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.800]   to start with.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.720]   - For people listening,
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.320]   what is difference equations versus differential equations?
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.720]   - Okay, a difference equation is like you can do
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.560]   in a spreadsheet.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.840]   You'll have, this is the value for 1990,
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.200]   this is the value for 1991, '92, '93, '94.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.680]   So you have discrete jumps in time.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.240]   Whereas the differential equation says
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.360]   there's a process moving through time.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.040]   And you will have a rate of change of a variable
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.480]   is a function of the state of itself and other variables
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.640]   and rates of change of those variables.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.000]   And that is what you use
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.320]   when you're doing an aggregate model.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.840]   So if you're modeling water, for example, or fluid dynamics,
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.520]   you have a set of differential equations
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.400]   describing the entire body of fluid moving through time.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.520]   You don't try to model the discrete motion
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.280]   of each molecule of H2O.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.720]   So at the aggregate level,
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.800]   you use differential equations for processes
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.320]   that occur through time.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.880]   And that's economics, it occurs through time.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.200]   You should be using that particular technology.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.680]   But some economists do learn differential equations,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.720]   but they don't learn stability analysis.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.000]   So they simply assume equilibrium is stable
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   and they work in equilibrium terms all the time.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.440]   And that's, it is the technical level,
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.160]   it's an incredibly complicated way of modeling the world
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.000]   using entirely the wrong tools.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.560]   - Okay, we'll talk about that
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.440]   because it's unclear what the right tools are.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.400]   Maybe it's more clear to you, but--
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.120]   - I've got to make it clear to an audience.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.600]   - Well, so this is a very complicated world.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.920]   It's a complex world.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.800]   You talk about there, some of the most complex
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.920]   systems on Earth are the human mind,
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.480]   the economy, and the biosphere.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.920]   So we'll go, we'll go to that place.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.720]   I'm fascinated by complex systems.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.360]   I'm humbled by them, even at their simplest level
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.820]   of like cellular automata.
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.840]   I'm not sure what the right tools are to understand that,
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   especially when part of the complex system
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.600]   is like a hierarchy of other complex systems.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.280]   So you said the economy is a fascinating complex system,
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.920]   but it's made up of human minds.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.320]   And those are interesting.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.800]   Those are interesting, perhaps impossible to model,
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.000]   but we can try and we can try to figure out
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.120]   how to approximate them,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.400]   and maybe that's the challenge of economics.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.040]   Okay, we'll keep returning to the basics.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.380]   Let us try to learn something from history.
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.640]   I also see as part of economics
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.520]   is us trying to figure out stuff,
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.600]   and there's a few smart folks that write books
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.120]   throughout human history,
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.520]   and sometimes they name schools of economics after them.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.520]   So let us take a stroll through history.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.040]   - Okay.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.760]   - Can you describe at a high level
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.240]   what are the different schools of economics,
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.160]   perhaps ones that are interesting to you,
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.680]   perhaps ones that the difference between which
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.680]   reveal something useful or insightful for our conversation?
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.880]   So you could, classical, post-Keynesian, Austrian,
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.280]   I like the biophysical economics, and so on.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.600]   Other heterodox economic schools that you find interesting.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.120]   - Okay, I actually find interesting a school
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.920]   which went extinct about 250 years ago.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.340]   That's where I'd like to start from,
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.340]   and they're called the physiocrats.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.920]   And the name itself implies
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.160]   where their knowledge came from,
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.600]   because if you go back far enough in history,
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.320]   we didn't do autopsies.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.700]   But when you started doing autopsies,
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.360]   they found wires, they found tubes, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.280]   And they started seeing the body as a circulation system,
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.120]   and they applied the same sort of logic to the economy.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.600]   And they came out of an agricultural economy,
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.800]   which was France,
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.040]   and they saw that the wealth came effectively from the sun.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.360]   So they saw all wealth comes from,
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.880]   they said the soil, but what they really mean is sun.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.000]   The soil absorbs the energy of the sun.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   One seed plants, a thousand flea seeds come back.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.800]   There is no surplus.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   We are simply mining what we can find
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.440]   out of the natural economy.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.560]   That's where we should have stayed
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.720]   and developed from that forward.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.960]   We then went through the classical school of economics,
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.600]   which comes out of Adam Smith.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.960]   And Smith, coming from Scotland,
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.640]   looked at what the physiocrats said,
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.120]   and what the physiocrats argued
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.540]   was that agriculture is the source of all wealth,
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.080]   and the manufacturing sector is sterile.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.400]   That's literally the term they used
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.720]   to describe the manufacturing sector.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.800]   - What does sterile mean?
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.840]   - Sterile means you don't extract value.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.160]   You simply change the shape of value.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.320]   - So the value comes from the soil.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.840]   - Yeah, it comes from the soil.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.240]   That's the free gift of nature.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.280]   That's literally the phrase they used.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.240]   And we then distribute the free gift of nature around,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.680]   and we need carriages,
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.640]   which was the manufacturing term they used at the time,
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.240]   as well as wheat.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.860]   So to make the carriages,
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.720]   we take what's been taken from the soil,
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.260]   and we convert it to a different form,
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.940]   but there is no value added in manufacturing.
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.240]   So Smith looked at that and said,
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.440]   "Well, I'm from Scotland,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.120]   "and we've got these industries,
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.400]   "and we make stuff, and it's machinery."
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.880]   And he said, "No, it's not land
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.280]   "that gives us the source of value, it's labor."
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.120]   Now, that led to the classical school of thought,
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.120]   and that said that all value comes from labor,
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.920]   that value is objective,
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.920]   so it's the amount of effort you put in,
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.760]   that the price two things will exchange for
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.080]   reflects the relative effort
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.860]   that's involved in the manufacturing.
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.760]   So this computer takes two hours to make,
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.060]   and this bottle takes two minutes to make,
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.520]   then this is worth 60 times as much as that.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.640]   They didn't talk about marginal cost.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.520]   It was absolute cost, effectively.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.880]   They didn't talk about utility as a subjective thing.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.440]   They ridiculed subjective utility theory.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.380]   That led to Marx,
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.300]   and Marx is probably the most brilliant mind
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.380]   in the history of economics.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.780]   The only other competitor I'd see is Schumpeter,
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.820]   possibly Keynes, but in my terms of ranking of intellects,
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.260]   I view Marx, Schumpeter, Keynes
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.620]   in terms of the outstanding capacities to think.
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.180]   But Marx then turned that classical school,
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.700]   which was pro-capitalism and anti-feudal,
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.980]   into a critique of capitalism,
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.740]   which led to the neoclassical school
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.260]   coming along as a defense of capitalism,
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.660]   but they defended it using the ideas
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.980]   of the subjective theory of value,
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.780]   so that value does not reflect effort.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:42.500]   It's the satisfaction individuals get from different objects
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.620]   that determines their value, marginal utility.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.420]   It's the marginal cost
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.480]   that determines how much they sell for.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.900]   Capitalism equilibrates marginal cost and marginal utility,
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.500]   and the concepts of equilibrium
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.300]   and marginal this and marginal that
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.100]   became the neoclassical school,
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.580]   and that's still the dominant school now 150 years later.
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.500]   So that's the one that everybody learns,
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.980]   and when you first learn economics,
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.500]   if you don't have the critical background
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.380]   that I managed to acquire,
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.940]   that's what you think is economics,
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.460]   the marginal utility, equilibrium-oriented analysis
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.020]   of mainstream economics,
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.380]   and for example, they ignore money.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.620]   People think economists, you must be an expert on money
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.700]   because you're an economist.
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.980]   Well, in fact, economists learn literally
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.660]   in the first few weeks at university
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.500]   that money is irrelevant.
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.020]   They say money illusion.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.900]   So they represent people's tastes
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.900]   using what they call indifference curves,
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.220]   and they're like isoquants on a weather map.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.180]   If you look at an isoquant,
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.960]   it shows you all the points of the same pressure.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.580]   So you can be here or you can be in Denver,
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.300]   and the air pressure can be the same
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.660]   if you're in the same weather unit,
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.780]   so you just draw a cell that links together.
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.260]   Well, they do the same thing with utility
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.220]   and say lots of bananas and very few coconuts
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.380]   can give you the same utility
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.460]   as lots of coconuts and very few bananas,
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.660]   and you draw basically like a hyperbola
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.580]   running down and linking the two,
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.620]   and they'll say, well, that's your utility.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.300]   That describes your tastes,
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.560]   and then we have your income,
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.820]   and given your income,
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.460]   you can buy that many bananas completely
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.500]   or that many coconuts
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.660]   or a straight line combination of the two,
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.000]   and then if we double the price,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.420]   nominal price of coconuts
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.580]   and double the nominal price of bananas
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.780]   and double your income,
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.720]   what happens, and the correct answer is oh, nothing, sir.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.920]   You stay at the same point of tangency
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.880]   between what your budget is
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.620]   and which particular utility curve
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.920]   gives you the maximum satisfaction,
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.200]   so that gets ingrained into them,
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.840]   and I think anybody who worries about money
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.160]   suffers from money illusion.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.660]   You are therefore ignorant
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.160]   of the deep insights of economics
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.040]   if you think money actually matters,
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.400]   so you have an entire theory of economics
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.760]   which presumes we exchange through data.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.080]   I'll swap you that Microsoft Surface for,
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.160]   no, actually, I'll take two of those for one of these.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.960]   We do this bartering type arrangement.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.920]   In fact, that only works
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.880]   if money plays no creative role in the economy,
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.840]   and that's where you'll find, reading Schumpeter,
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.160]   the insight that's the school of thought that I come from
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.080]   that says money is essential.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.760]   Money actually adds to demand,
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.040]   and we'll talk about that later on,
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.680]   so that's the neoclassical school
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.600]   that ends up being subjective theory of value,
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.680]   non-monetary, as though everything happens in barter,
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.040]   and focusing on equilibrium,
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.160]   as though everything happens in equilibrium,
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.920]   or if you get disturbed from equilibrium,
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.920]   you return back to it again,
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.720]   and that mindset describes capitalism.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.040]   Its most interesting feature
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.000]   is that it reaches equilibrium.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.440]   Now, what planet are we on to believe that?
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.120]   Because if you look at the real world,
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.120]   the real exciting world of capitalism in which we live,
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.320]   change is by far the most obvious characteristic of it.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.720]   - There's no equilibrium.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.840]   - There's no equilibrium.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.440]   It's unstable, and as a mathematician,
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.600]   it's easy to, you work with stability analysis.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.560]   You work out what the Jacobian is,
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.160]   you work out your Lyapunov exponents in a complex system.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.080]   You're used to the idea that equilibrium is unstable,
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.280]   but economists get schooled in believing
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.400]   that everything happens in equilibrium,
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.280]   and they don't learn stability analysis,
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.140]   so all that stuff is missing,
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.040]   so onto the schools of thought,
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:32.080]   treating the economy as an equilibrium system,
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.000]   which was what the neoclassical school did,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.500]   is what Keynes disturbed,
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.160]   and he really disturbed it by talking about,
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.720]   fundamentally, that uncertainty determines
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.500]   our decisions about the future,
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.440]   so when we consume, you know,
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.640]   if you like Pfizer or whatever particular drink
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.880]   you wanna have, you know the current situation,
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.020]   but to invest, you must be making guesses about the future,
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.680]   but you don't know the future, so what do you do?
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.320]   You extrapolate what you currently know,
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.480]   and as you said, this is a terrible basis
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.240]   on which to plan for the future,
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.740]   but this is the only thing you can do
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.680]   where there is no possibility of solid calculation,
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.960]   so investment is therefore subject to uncertainty,
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.580]   and therefore, you will get volatility out of investment.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.100]   You will get fads, of course, booms and slumps
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.880]   coming out of that, 'cause people extrapolate
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.520]   for the current conditions,
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.280]   and that's the normal state of a capitalist economy,
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.120]   and Schumpeter argued that that's what gives us
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.920]   this creativity as well,
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.000]   the fact that you can perceive a potential demand,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.600]   but first of all, you don't know
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.400]   whether that demand's going to work,
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.440]   secondly, you don't know who your competitor's going to be,
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.680]   whether somebody's going to be ahead of you or behind,
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.340]   if there's a fad, you'll overinvest, okay?
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.000]   All this stuff is the real nature of capitalism,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.400]   and that's what we should be trying to capture,
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.120]   the dynamic, non-equilibrium, monetary violence
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.960]   and creativity of capitalism,
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.720]   that's what we should be analyzing,
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:03.640]   and the post-Keynesian school has gone in that orientation.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.300]   They've been, in my opinion, inhibited
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.960]   by learning their mathematics from neoclassical economists,
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.240]   so they don't have enough
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.320]   of the technology of complex systems.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.120]   There's only a really tiny handful of people
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.280]   working in complex systems analysis
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.180]   in post-Keynesian economics,
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.000]   but that is, to me, the most interesting area.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.720]   - So their tools may be lacking,
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.000]   but they fundamentally accept the instability of things.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.840]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.280]   - And so that's what makes them interesting.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.640]   So let me try to summarize what you said,
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.520]   and then you say how stupid I am.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.000]   Okay, so then there was the physiocrats
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.840]   that thought value came from the land.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.120]   Then there's Adam Smith, who said,
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.120]   "Nah, value comes from human labor."
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.540]   That was the classical school.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:56.540]   And then neoclassical is value comes
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:01.180]   from bananas and coconuts, human preferences,
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:06.140]   like human happiness, how happy a banana makes you.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:10.460]   And then the Keynesian and the post-Keynesian were like,
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.140]   yeah, well, you can't, you can never,
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.960]   the moment you try to put value to a banana and a coconut,
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.380]   you're already working in the past.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.660]   - Yeah.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.140]   - It's always going to be chaos and stability,
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.080]   and then you just, you're fishing in uncertain waters,
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.460]   and that's why we have to embrace that
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.800]   and come up with tools that model that well.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.060]   And also, Joseph Schumpeter,
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.760]   what school would you put him under?
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.900]   Is he a Keynesian or is he Austrian economics?
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.060]   - He's an Austrian, and the Austrians deny.
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.300]   - Okay. - That's the intriguing.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:50.300]   - He's from Austria, but he's not an Austrian economist.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.840]   - There are elements of the Austrian school of thought
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:53.860]   which are worthwhile.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.460]   - What is Austrian economics
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.140]   in this beautiful whirlwind picture that you painted?
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.940]   - Okay, Austrian economics grew out of the rebellion
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.200]   against the classical school.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.860]   So you had three intellects who mainly led the growth
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.500]   of the neoclassical school back in the 1870s.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.520]   It was William Jevons from England,
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.260]   Menger, who's from Austria,
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.340]   and Vollras from France.
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:21.500]   And Vollras tried to work out a set of equations
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:26.260]   to describe a multi-product economy
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.480]   where there's numerous producers and numerous consumers.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.780]   Everybody's both a producer and a consumer,
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.140]   and you try to work out a vector of prices
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.220]   that will give you equilibrium
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.620]   in all markets instantaneously.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.340]   And that's his equilibrium orientation.
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.100]   Jevons is also one about equilibrium,
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.980]   but he worked more at the aggregate level.
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.940]   So there's a supply curve and a demand curve,
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.780]   and that's what Marshall ultimately codified.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.380]   Menger was pretty much saying that,
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.420]   well, yes, there might be an equilibrium,
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.420]   but you're gonna get disturbed from it all the time.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.420]   You'll be above or below the equilibrium.
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.900]   And what came out of the Austrian school
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.460]   was an acceptance of that sort of vision
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.660]   that a market should reach equilibrium,
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.020]   but then said, well, you'll get disturbed
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.580]   away from the equilibrium.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.180]   And that's what gives you the vitality of capitalism
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.660]   because an entrepreneur will see an arbitrage advantage
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.220]   and try to close that gap,
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.340]   and that will give you innovation over time.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.980]   And Schumpeter went beyond that
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.060]   and saw the role of money and said that
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.060]   an entrepreneur is somebody with a great idea and no money.
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.100]   - Yeah. - Okay?
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.760]   So to become a capitalist, you've gotta get money.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.460]   And therefore, you've gotta approach the finance sector
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.540]   to get the money, and the finance sector creates money
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.380]   and also creates a debt for the entrepreneur.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:41.620]   And so you get this financial engine turning up as well,
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.980]   and you will get movements away from equilibrium
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.820]   out of that.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.380]   You won't necessarily head back towards the equilibrium.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.340]   So Schumpeter has a rich vision of capitalism
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.060]   in which money plays an essential role,
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:58.940]   in which you will be disturbed from equilibrium all the time.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.620]   And that is really, I think, a much closer vision
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.320]   of actual capitalism than anything by,
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:10.320]   even the leading Austrians, Hayek, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.500]   they, and certainly Ron Bardo, I find totally,
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.980]   like reading a cardboard cutout version
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.980]   of the wealth of nations, I find his worth trivial.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.280]   But Schumpeter was rich,
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.900]   but with the same foundations as the Austrians.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.140]   But because he talked about the importance of money,
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.860]   that took him away from the Austrian vision,
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.980]   which was very much based on a hard money idea of capitalism.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.020]   Schumpeter said you needed the capacity
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.360]   of the financial sector to create money,
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.620]   to empower entrepreneurs.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.800]   And that's a very important vision.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.580]   - So Schumpeter's argument is the deviation from equilibrium,
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.960]   that's where all the fun happens,
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.220]   that's where all the magic happens.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.780]   - That's the magic of capitalism.
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:52.700]   And like the Austrians,
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.180]   because they focus on the deviation from equilibrium
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.940]   are better than their classicals,
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.100]   but they still have this belief in the,
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.620]   you'll reach equilibrium ultimately,
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.060]   or you'll head back towards it.
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:07.380]   Whereas they don't have an explanation of capitalism
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.360]   that gives you cycles
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.100]   apart from having the wrong rate of interest.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.780]   So there's no role for an accumulation of debt over time.
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.000]   So what Schumpeter gave us was a vision
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.340]   of the creativity of capitalism
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.300]   being driven by entrepreneurs
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.180]   who are funded by money creation by the finance sector.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.120]   And that's fundamentally the world in which we live.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.420]   - So there's also,
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:35.420]   kids these days are all into modern monetary theory.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.660]   What's that about?
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.860]   - Okay, modern monetary theory is accounting.
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.140]   I wanna summarize it bluntly.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.180]   It's simply saying, let's do the accounting
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.740]   because what money is,
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.300]   is a creature of double entry bookkeeping.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.700]   - What's double entry bookkeeping?
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.180]   - Banks, this was invented back in the 1500s in Italy.
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.140]   I've forgotten the particular merchant who did it
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.260]   based on some Arabic ideas as well.
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.080]   But the thing is,
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.220]   if you wanna keep track of your financial flows,
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.380]   then you divide what you,
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.220]   all the financial claims on you,
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.380]   you divide into claims you have on somebody else,
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.740]   which are your assets,
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.100]   claims somebody else has on you,
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.580]   which are your liabilities,
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.100]   and the gap between the two is your equity.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.620]   So you record every transaction twice on one row.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.460]   Okay, so for example,
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.220]   if you and I do a financial transfer,
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.780]   you have a bank account, I have a bank account,
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.900]   your bank account will go down, mine goes up, okay?
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.880]   And that's, the sum of the operation is zero, okay?
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.280]   But on the other hand, if I go to a bank and borrow money,
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.400]   then my account goes up,
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.000]   they put money in my deposit account,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.360]   the bank's assets go up, okay?
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.920]   And there's still the same sum applies,
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.960]   assets minus liabilities minus equity equals zero.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.480]   Now that's simply saying money is an accounting,
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.860]   a creature of accounting,
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.920]   it's not a creature of a commodity.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.520]   So if you think about how Austrians think about money,
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.320]   and how gold bugs think about money,
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.920]   and Bitcoin enthusiasts, if there are any left,
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.400]   think about money,
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.240]   what they see is money is an object, okay?
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.640]   And you and I can both have more gold,
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.920]   if we're both willing to go to this,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.860]   you know, a mine somewhere and dig a few holes
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.760]   and get a few specks of gold out.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.280]   So there's no competition or no interaction
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.360]   between you and me if money is gold.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.020]   And I think money should be an object, a commodity.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.240]   But money fundamentally is not a commodity,
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.140]   it's a claim on somebody else.
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.560]   That's money's essence.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.400]   So when you do it,
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.560]   you must use double entry bookkeeping to do it.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.440]   And then when you do,
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.360]   you find all the answers that come out of thinking
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.400]   as money as a commodity are wrong.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.240]   So for example, I've got Elon on this one,
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.880]   so I wanna get this rid of Elon,
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.880]   'cause I saw him making a comment about this
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.360]   a few weeks ago on Twitter.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.960]   He said that it's wrong for the government,
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.440]   effectively it seems wrong for the government
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.680]   to always be in deficit.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.280]   Okay, now when you look at it and say,
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.380]   well, how is money created?
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.320]   How does money come about
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.800]   when it's not a commodity like gold,
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.400]   which you dig up out of the ground,
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.000]   when it's actually social relations
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.080]   between people that create money?
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.840]   Well, money is the,
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.200]   they're fundamentally the liabilities of the banking sector.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.360]   If we make a transfer between us,
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.020]   your deposit account goes down,
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.400]   my deposit account goes up.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.720]   Those are exchanges on the liability side
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.520]   of the banking sector.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.000]   But if we have a transaction with a bank,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.520]   then if the bank lends us money,
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.760]   its assets loans go up, its deposits go up,
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.080]   again, that same balance.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.640]   So you've gotta look and say,
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.400]   money therefore is fundamentally
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.680]   the liabilities of the banking sector.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.440]   So how do you create additional liabilities?
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.600]   You must have an operation which occurs
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.120]   both on the liability side
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.840]   and the asset side of the banking sector.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.000]   So if you and I make a new transaction,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.080]   no money is created.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.440]   Existing money is redistributed.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.520]   But if you go to a bank and take out a bank loan,
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.680]   then money is created by the bank loan.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.800]   So the liabilities of the banking sector rise,
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.240]   the assets rise, they're balanced,
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.560]   but more liabilities means,
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.040]   the banking sector means more money.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.960]   So that's how private banks create money.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.540]   And that's what I first started working on
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.960]   when I became an academic about 35 years ago,
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.280]   the actual dynamics of private money creation.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.480]   But the government has the same sort of story.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.400]   If the government runs a deficit,
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:26.400]   it spends more money on the individuals in the economy
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.880]   than it taxes them,
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.360]   which means their bank accounts increase.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.320]   So a government deficit creates money
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.440]   for the private sector.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.240]   So that's where money creation occurs from the government.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:44.120]   So it puts more money into people's bank accounts
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.840]   by spending, by welfare payments
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.040]   than it takes out by taxation.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.840]   So that's creating new money.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.280]   And then on the other side of the bank,
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.280]   the money turns up in the reserve accounts of the banks,
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.680]   which are basically the private banks' bank accounts
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.400]   at the central bank.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.700]   So rather than the asset of private money creation
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.000]   being loans,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.500]   the asset of government money creation is reserves.
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.140]   Okay?
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:11.980]   - Right.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.320]   Money creation.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.160]   - Money creation.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.320]   - Is a good thing.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.840]   So you mentioned a bunch of stuff
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.240]   like private money creation
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.720]   with the liabilities in the banks,
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.160]   and then how the government is doing,
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.520]   the reserves, blah, blah, blah.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.960]   At the end of the day,
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.560]   there's a bunch of printers that are printing money.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.480]   And then you also said something interesting,
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.680]   which is social relations between humans
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.560]   is what creates money.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.040]   I think my mind was blown several times
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.300]   over the past minute.
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.920]   So it's difficult for me to reconstruct
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.580]   the pieces of my mind back together.
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.880]   But basic question,
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.760]   is money creation a good thing or a bad thing?
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.440]   - Money creation is a good thing
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.640]   because money creation is what allows commerce to happen.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.560]   - Isn't there a conservation of--
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.400]   - No, there isn't.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.360]   I had arguments with physicists over this,
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.200]   and it took me a long time to answer it.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.520]   They thought the sum total of all money is zero.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.340]   - Yeah.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.180]   - Okay.
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.640]   It's the sum total of all assets and liabilities is zero.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.880]   So if you imagine your assets
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.620]   minus your liabilities is your equity,
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.400]   and your asset is somebody else's liability,
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.560]   and your liability is somebody else's asset.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.520]   When we're talking about financial assets,
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.920]   and this is another mind blowing thing
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.820]   that I've just recently solved myself.
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.320]   So the sum total of all financial assets
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.860]   and liabilities is zero.
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.640]   - Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.880]   I'm gonna interrupt you rudely.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.140]   What are assets?
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.200]   What are liabilities?
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.040]   - Assets are your claims on somebody else.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:41.880]   So--
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.720]   - Specific.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.600]   Give me an example of an asset.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.680]   - Okay, do you have a mortgage for this house?
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.160]   - No, I'm renting.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.080]   - You're renting, there you go.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.120]   Well, if you had a mortgage, that'd be your liability.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:52.960]   - That would be my liability.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.800]   - Okay.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.200]   The mortgage would be the bank's asset.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.040]   - Right.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.600]   - Okay, if you add the two together, you get zero.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.000]   - Okay, so that's zero.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.840]   - That's zero.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.920]   The money is the liability side of the banking sector.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.800]   - Okay.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.880]   - Okay, assets are the,
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.020]   the assets on the other side
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.880]   can be either created by the banking sector,
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.960]   which is where you get bank loans,
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.560]   or created by the government where you get reserves.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.000]   But money is the liabilities.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.160]   Money is, if you think about protons and anti-protons
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.720]   in that sense, money is like the anti-proton.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.640]   It's the negative, the liability.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.600]   - But wait, wait, wait.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.280]   The liability is the negative.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.120]   - Yeah.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:32.940]   - But how's that money?
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.780]   I thought money is the positive.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.960]   - What is a liability for the banking sector
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.800]   is an asset for you and me.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.340]   - And assets includes money?
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.000]   - Okay.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.240]   - If you have a bank, like you'd have a bank account,
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.200]   and you'd have some cash, okay?
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.280]   Okay, those are your assets.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.080]   But the bank account is a liability to the banking sector,
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.900]   and the cash is a liability to the Federal Reserve.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.020]   - Okay, so what's money?
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:01.040]   - Well, money is the promise of a third party
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.200]   that we both accept to close our transaction.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.040]   And this is--
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:05.860]   - And that's a bank?
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:06.700]   - That's a bank.
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.360]   Yeah, this is, one of the most important works I've ever read
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.080]   is a work by a wonderful, now unfortunately deceased,
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.800]   tiny Italian economist-- - It's a tiny--
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.680]   - Called Augusto Graziani.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.600]   - Oh, big guy. - And he's the most
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.160]   wonderful personality.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.920]   Augusto, I've met him on a few occasions,
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.520]   is one of the few human beings
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.600]   who can speak in perfectly formed paragraphs, okay?
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.120]   Superbly eloquent.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.160]   And what he did was write a paper called
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.000]   "The Monetary Theory of Production."
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.120]   You can find it, download it on the web.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.560]   It's pretty much open source now.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.400]   And what he said is,
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.040]   what distinguishes a monetary economy from a barter economy?
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.440]   So he said, "In a barter economy,
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.500]   "what we do is, I'll give you two of these
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.680]   "for one of those."
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.880]   Yeah, okay, barter.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.880]   Just working at a relative price.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.000]   There are two of us involved,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.500]   and there are two commodities.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:02.360]   So with money, money is a triangular transaction, okay?
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.920]   There is one commodity,
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.840]   I wanna buy that can of drink off you,
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.320]   two people, and the price that's worked out
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.960]   ends up being in a transfer from the promises to pay
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.880]   the bank that the buyer has,
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.160]   to the promises to pay the bank that the seller has.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.960]   So if I, so what you have is a monetary transaction
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.360]   in a capitalist economy involves three agents,
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.520]   the buyer, the seller, and the bank.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.000]   - So the bank always has to be part of it.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.320]   - Well, the bank has to be part of it.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.480]   When I hand you the money,
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.720]   you accept that as you've now got,
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.320]   rather than it's the bank promising to pay me something,
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.280]   it's now the bank promising to pay you something.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.440]   And we exchange the promises of banks,
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.000]   and that's fundamentally money.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.320]   - So money is fundamentally a threesome,
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.280]   and everybody gets fucked.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.160]   Is that a good way to put it?
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.000]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.440]   - At least, for the guys who's actually like,
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.400]   oh, now I can use French in this conversation.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.240]   That's good.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.240]   - That's not French, that's a different language.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.520]   I'll explain it to you one day.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.640]   You Australians will never understand.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.960]   Okay, if I can return to,
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.360]   we'll jump around if it's okay.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.240]   - That's fine.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.520]   - So you mentioned Karl Marx
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:17.520]   as one of the great intellects, economic thinkers ever.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.980]   He might be number one.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.140]   You study him quite a bit.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.000]   You disagree with him quite a bit,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.120]   but you still think he's a powerful thinker.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.560]   - A powerful mind.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.400]   - A powerful mind.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.000]   So first of all, let's just explore the human.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.820]   Why do you say so?
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.020]   What's interesting in that mind?
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.260]   In the way he saw the world,
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.920]   what are the insights that you find brilliant?
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.720]   - The Marx once described his major work
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.720]   as towards a critical examination of everything existing.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.280]   (laughing)
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.120]   So he's a modest bastard.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:59.600]   So he wanted to understand and criticize everything.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:04.360]   And even, he wasn't trained directly by Hegel,
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.920]   but his teachers were Hegelian philosophers.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.540]   And what Hegel developed was a concept called dialectics.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:15.260]   And dialectics is a philosophy of change.
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:19.580]   And when most people hear the word dialectics,
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.020]   they come up with this unpronounceable trio of words
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.820]   called thesis, antithesis, synthesis.
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.980]   I can barely get the words out myself.
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.380]   And that actually is not Hegel at all.
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.700]   That's another German philosopher called Fichte.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.220]   - Oh, I thought it was Kant.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.200]   - No, Fichte.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.040]   Well, I'm not sure.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:35.860]   - I'm mixing them up.
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:36.700]   All Germans look the same to me.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:38.060]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.620]   (laughing)
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.540]   So, but if you look,
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.740]   there's a beautiful book called "Marx and Contradiction."
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.940]   You wanna find a great explanation for Marx's philosophy.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:46.780]   I've forgotten the author.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.860]   I think it's Wilde, W-I-L-D-E, "Marx and Contradiction."
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:54.380]   And he points out the actual origins of Marx's philosophy.
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.100]   I didn't know that when I first read Marx.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.940]   So I became exposed to Marx
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.380]   when I was a student at Sydney University.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.400]   And we'd had a strike at the university
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.360]   over the teaching of philosophy.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.640]   And what happened was the philosophy department
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.240]   had a lot of radical philosophers in it
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.440]   and a conservative chief philosopher.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.920]   And the radicals wanted to have a course
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.560]   on what they called feminist aspects of philosophical,
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.440]   sorry, philosophical aspects of feminist thought.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.240]   And the staff voted in favor of it.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.080]   This is back in the days
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.600]   when university departments were democratic.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.000]   The professor opposed it.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.280]   He got it blocked at a high level.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.160]   The staff leapfrogged over that.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.540]   And then finally the vice chancellor blocked it.
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.220]   So that led to a strike over the teaching of philosophy
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.180]   at Sydney University, which at one stage,
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.120]   over half the students were on strike.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.940]   Economics began out of that.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.580]   - Over teaching of a philosophy of feminism.
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:49.420]   - Yes.
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.260]   - That's good to be.
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:53.120]   - That's such a different life to what we're living now.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.660]   That's the academic milieu in which I developed
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.780]   all my ideas.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.860]   And I had become a critic.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.060]   I've gone from being a believer of mainstream economics
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.800]   when I was a first year student
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.020]   to disbelieving at halfway through first year.
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.020]   Okay, and I then spent a long time trying to change it,
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.180]   getting nowhere.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.860]   And then this philosophy strike happened
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.540]   and we took it on in economics
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:18.340]   and we formed what's called the political economy movement
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.840]   and had a successful strike.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.940]   We actually managed to pressure the university
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.540]   into establishing a department of political economy
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:28.980]   at Sydney University, as well as the department of economics.
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.260]   - What was the foundational ideas?
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.020]   Were you resistant to the whole censorship
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:38.020]   of why can't you have a philosophy of anything course?
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.300]   - Well, it was much more libertarian
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:44.380]   in the genuine sense of the word period of time
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.300]   at the end of the 60s, beginning of the 70s
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.580]   than the word libertarian has been corrupted since then.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.420]   But it really was about free thought.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.080]   And you went to university to learn.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.540]   It was about education.
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:57.300]   I remember having a fight with my father once
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.100]   where dad was angry about the marks
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.020]   I was getting for some of my courses.
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.540]   And he said, "If you don't get a decent result,
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.260]   "you won't get a decent job."
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.460]   And I said, "I'm not here to get a job.
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.420]   "I'm here to get an education."
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.260]   - Oh, wow.
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.220]   - Okay, now the thing is, ultimately,
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.420]   it's been a pretty good job for me as well.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:12.820]   This is in Sydney, by the way.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.060]   And Sydney in summer is absolutely gorgeous.
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.980]   And what does a bunch of lefties decide to do during summer
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.500]   but read Karl Marx?
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.300]   - Yeah, on the beach or?
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:25.820]   - Actually, inside the room of the philosophy department
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.860]   at the University of Sydney in the main quadrangle.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.380]   There's sandstone all around us.
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.500]   And we, a bunch of about 20 or 30 of us
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.540]   reading our way through Marx.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.220]   - Capital, which capital?
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.100]   - Volume I Capital.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:42.320]   And I remember walking off to that meeting
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.780]   with one of my friends who's a law student.
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.900]   And this was a period of a huge construction boom in Sydney.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.860]   So the whole skyline, which we could see from the campus,
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.000]   was full of what they call kangaroo cranes,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.660]   which were an Australian invention.
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.300]   That are cranes that can be leapfrogged over each other
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.900]   to build a skyscraper.
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.980]   - So here you are reading Karl Marx,
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.900]   looking at the mechanisms of capitalism.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.260]   - And I looked at those mechanisms
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.940]   and I knew Marx argued that labor
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.940]   was the only source of value.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.740]   And he said machinery doesn't add value.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.820]   - So the cranes are worthless.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.100]   - I'm looking at these cranes and thinking,
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.100]   I want a very good explanation by Marx
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.340]   as to why these cranes don't add value.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.140]   So reading through the first seven chapters of Capital,
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:26.080]   what you found was Marx applying this dialectic.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.960]   And like the fiction and stuff is bullshit.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.680]   That is not how Marx thought at all.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.080]   I was reading, trying to find the thesis, antithesis,
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.960]   synthesis, and it's not there at all
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.280]   in any of Marx's works.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.200]   And I've read everything he's ever written on economics
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   from 1844 to 1894 when his last books were published.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.400]   There's not one word of mention of that.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.880]   What he does talk about is foreground
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.440]   and background and tension.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.120]   And his idea of a dialectic is that there is,
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:57.060]   a unity will exist in society.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.500]   And that unity can be an individual,
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.180]   that can be a commodity, anything at all.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.000]   The unity will be understood by that society.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.340]   One particular aspect will be focused upon.
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:10.620]   So if you think about the human being in capitalism,
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.260]   the focus on the human being as an object
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.780]   is their capacity to work.
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.020]   You're a worker, okay?
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.620]   That gets put in the foreground.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.980]   The fact that you're human and you wanna play a guitar
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.460]   and go surfing and make love
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.360]   and all the other things that humans do
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.240]   is pushed into the background.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.340]   There's a tension between the two of those.
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.220]   And that can transform that unity over time.
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:37.540]   And that's a beautiful dynamic vision of change.
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.940]   So dialectics is a philosophy of change.
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.880]   - So synthesis, antithesis is what,
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.860]   does every idea have a counter argument?
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.420]   - Yeah, there's a positive and negative
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.660]   and you bring them together somehow.
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:51.340]   - And then Marx has this foreground, background,
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.020]   and tension. - Foreground is all
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.900]   what we think of as economics and background
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.540]   is all the lovemaking we do as humans.
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.380]   - That sort of thing.
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.580]   - And why is there a tension?
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.940]   - Well, because if you mention the unity,
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:07.540]   like if you take a human in any preview,
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.180]   'cause you go back to Cro-Magnon days
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.660]   when we're living in caves and we've gotta go hunting
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.220]   and cook food and stuff like that,
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:18.140]   but there's no social hierarchy as we've become used to.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.420]   So you don't get labored as a worker or a capitalist,
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.620]   you're just a human in that situation.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:26.300]   Then you've got more of an integrated view of who you are.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.580]   And I think that's one of the appeals of a tribal,
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.260]   a genuine tribal culture,
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.460]   that you get treated for the whole of who you are.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.060]   You've certainly categorized, you're male, you're female,
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.780]   you're young, you're old, you're a hunter,
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.380]   you're a tool maker, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.660]   but you're treated as more an integrated object.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.480]   When you get put in a complex society
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.240]   like a capitalist society,
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.220]   then one side of you is emphasized
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.900]   and the others are de-emphasized.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.860]   - So is it fair to say that the background
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:54.260]   is like our basic fundamental humanity
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.820]   and the foreground is the machine of capitalism?
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.460]   - Effectively, and when you look at it in terms of a human.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.500]   But what Marx did is apply this to a commodity.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.580]   So he said, "What is the essential unity
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.140]   "in a capitalist economy?"
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.540]   And the essential unity is a commodity.
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.420]   - The essential unit.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.940]   - The essential unity.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.780]   - What's unity?
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.380]   - Unity is an object in society.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.220]   - Okay.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.300]   - Okay, so he started from the point
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:20.180]   of you are trying to understand how exchange occurs.
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.740]   How do we set prices?
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.540]   And his starting vision was to say
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:28.540]   that a commodity is a unity in a capitalist economy.
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:33.140]   The part of the unity that we focus upon
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.340]   is the exchange value.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.020]   A capitalist produces a commodity,
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.900]   not because of its qualitative characteristics,
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.000]   but because it'd be sold for a profit.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.900]   So the foreground aspect of a commodity
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.020]   is its exchange value.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.780]   The background aspect of it,
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.700]   it won't succeed as a commodity unless it has a use value.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:55.220]   - So the background is the utility thing.
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.340]   - Yeah, see, if you made something which didn't work,
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.500]   - Okay, yeah.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.660]   - Then it has, you might be able to sell it,
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.980]   but it has no utility.
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.900]   That can't, you can't make that into a commodity.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.340]   A broken thing can't be sold.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.940]   - Does that have the subjective?
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.900]   - Yeah, it has to have the subjective side.
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:10.740]   - So people enjoy it.
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.140]   - As well as the objective.
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.020]   So the objective is what capitalists worry about.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.380]   I'll give you my favorite counter example of that.
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.260]   I was in, I took a bunch of Australian journalists to China
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.140]   way back in the period when the Gang of Four
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.940]   was being on trial.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:28.260]   And we did a tour of the Forbidden City in Beijing.
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.660]   And at that stage, all the artifacts of the royal family,
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.500]   the emperor, were actually in the building still.
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.960]   And we walked past one of them,
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.940]   and it was this gold, solid gold bar about this long,
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.060]   shaped like a fist, turned over like this.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.420]   And on this side, there were rubies, emeralds, diamonds.
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.020]   You'd never seen gemstones.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.780]   I mean, gems that big.
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.740]   And one of the journalists asked me what I thought it was,
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:52.620]   and I said, "Oh, it's obvious.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.420]   "Jane, it's a backscratcher, ha, ha, ha."
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.780]   I walked away, she caught up with me
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.860]   about 20 minutes later, said, "I asked one of the guides.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.380]   "It is a backscratcher."
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.580]   So here's a backscratcher for the emperor
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.580]   made of solid gold with diamonds and rubies and emeralds
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.900]   during the scratching.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.620]   Now that's a commodity in a feudal society.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.300]   Cost doesn't matter.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.220]   You want the most elaborate, beautiful thing
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:16.740]   'cause you are the emperor.
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:20.060]   So in a feudal society, the commodity,
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:22.620]   what's focused upon is the utility.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.740]   And the cost of production when you're the emperor
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:25.980]   is immaterial.
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.140]   Capitalism reverses that.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.240]   So the commodity in a capitalist economy
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:35.240]   is a plastic $2 scratcher you can get from Kmart or Target.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:39.900]   And so the use value is necessary,
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.740]   but irrelevant to forming the price.
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.780]   Now that was a completely different vision
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.940]   of exchange in capitalism
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.860]   to what I found in the neoclassical theory
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.640]   'cause that says it's the marginal utility
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.060]   and the marginal cost of everything
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.940]   that determines the exchange ratio.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.180]   And the crazy thing about that
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.720]   is not so much the marginal utility,
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.580]   but the argument in the neoclassical theory
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.680]   is that the price ratio, the price will,
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.960]   when there's an exchange going on,
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.300]   there's two person, two commodity exchange
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.240]   of two commodities between two people,
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:18.540]   they will, the price will change until such time
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.940]   as the ratio of the marginal utilities
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:23.940]   is equal to the ratio of the marginal costs.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.220]   That's supposed to be the equilibrium.
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:26.980]   And Marx says, that's bullshit.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:30.940]   That's a previous society where you exchange stuff
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:32.420]   that you happen to have
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.580]   for stuff somebody else happened to have
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.780]   without any real production mechanism being involved.
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.480]   And he said, that's like when you have
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.680]   two ancient tribes, two tribes meeting
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.200]   for the very first time,
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.600]   and one tribe can make something
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.400]   the other tribe can't make.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.200]   And they will therefore,
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.120]   the price they were willing to pay
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.920]   reflect how unique this other object is
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.320]   that this one tribe can make and the other can't.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.520]   So for example, the story of Manhattan
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.840]   being sold for 40 glass beads,
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.000]   it's actually 40 glass trading beads.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.800]   I believe it is a true story.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.560]   But the thing is, the Indians couldn't make glass beads.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.220]   So they valued the glass beads
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.100]   at the Island of Manhattan,
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.380]   which is a utility-based comparison.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.100]   What Marx said, that's the very initial contact.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.980]   Over time, even if you don't know the technology,
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.820]   over time, you start to realize
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.180]   how much work goes involved
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.020]   to making what they're selling you
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.340]   versus what you're selling to them.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.820]   And you start making stuff specifically for sale.
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.680]   So Elon's not losing personal utility
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.540]   each time a Model 3 goes out the door.
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.420]   He might get utility out of the fact
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.500]   that he's created that vehicle,
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.600]   that concept, and manufactures it and so on,
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.860]   but he's not losing utility
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.260]   each time a Model T Ford goes out the door
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:50.180]   after going back for the ancient commodity there.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:53.260]   So the utility plays no role
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.300]   in setting price in Marx's model,
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.060]   whereas it's essential in the neoclassical model.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.500]   - What's the difference between utility
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.820]   and marginal utility?
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:04.300]   What does the word marginal mean
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.220]   and why is it such a problem?
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.540]   - It turns marginal utility,
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.020]   well, utility itself has different meanings
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.140]   in the two schools of thought.
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.060]   If you take the classical school of thought,
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:15.620]   which when Marx comes from,
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.060]   utility is effectively objective.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.500]   So the utility of a chair is that you can sit in it,
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.400]   not how comfortable it makes you feel.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.100]   - Yeah. - Now, can I,
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.380]   if you think about the utility of the chairs,
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.140]   we're both sitting in, they're identical
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:30.580]   from a classical point of view, we're both sitting.
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.340]   But from a neoclassical point of view,
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.500]   it's how comfortable it makes you feel.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.900]   And that depends upon your subjective feelings of comfort.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.420]   You might be far more comfortable in the identical chair
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.020]   that I'm sitting in than I am.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.980]   And therefore the comparison is difficult.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.420]   And therefore working out a ratio
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.100]   involves you've got a decline in your,
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:53.780]   each time you give away a chair in exchange for an iPhone,
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.780]   you have a fall in your utility.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:47:00.580]   And then therefore you want a higher return
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:03.300]   because you're losing more utility each time.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.420]   The more chairs you give away,
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.220]   the less utility you're getting from chairs.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.500]   So there's a decline in your utility.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.980]   That's your marginal utility.
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.660]   So it's including your subjective valuation
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.260]   in setting the price.
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:18.500]   And what Marx pointed out is this is a caricature
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.740]   of actual change in a capitalist economy.
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:22.340]   'Cause we have in a capitalist economy,
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.820]   huge factories sending out huge quantities
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.620]   specifically for sale.
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:30.740]   They've got no utility to the seller unless they're sold.
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:36.100]   So it's a very different vision of how price is set.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.980]   And Marx used that to explain where profit comes from,
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.180]   but he made a mistake.
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:45.900]   And his argument was that talking about a worker
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.340]   as now your unity,
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.820]   this foreground, background tension thing,
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.100]   the foreground is that you hire a worker
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.780]   for their cost of production.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.220]   And the cost of production is a subsistence wage.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.100]   The utility to the buyer
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.300]   is the fact that they can work in a factory.
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.740]   Now it might take six hours, let's say,
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.540]   to make the means of subsistence.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.820]   And that's the exchange value.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.820]   And that's what the capitalist pays
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.580]   as a wage to the worker.
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.220]   But they can work in the factory for 12 hours.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:19.340]   That's the utility.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:24.700]   12 minus six is six surplus of value hours.
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.780]   And that's where profit comes from.
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:27.940]   And that was Marx's argument.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.100]   And I thought it was brilliant,
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:32.380]   but it also applied to machinery.
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:33.220]   - Right, okay.
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:34.380]   Let's lean on that.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:35.220]   Hold on a second.
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.380]   No, no, deep is good.
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.380]   Just wanted to find terms.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.340]   Don't take that statement out of context,
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.660]   the internet, please.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:42.500]   Okay.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:48.220]   You said buyer, seller, worker.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:51.220]   In a factory, who's the seller, who's the buyer?
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:55.780]   Why is the worker the buyer?
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.140]   - Well, the worker's the commodity in this case.
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:00.260]   If you're gonna make stuff in a factory,
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:01.900]   you've gotta hire workers.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:02.740]   - Yes.
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:03.580]   - And what Marx is saying,
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.060]   the buyer in that situation is a capitalist.
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.620]   So what does the buyer pay?
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.340]   He says he pays the exchange value.
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:11.540]   That's, back to the commodity thing,
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:13.100]   because that's the starting point.
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:14.660]   He said the essential unity
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.220]   in a capitalist economy is the commodity.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.100]   A commodity has two characteristics,
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.100]   exchange value and use value.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.980]   Exchange value of a commodity in a capitalist economy
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:27.060]   will be its cost of production.
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.100]   Use value is what you do with it, okay,
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.140]   once you've purchased it.
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.980]   - But labor is a commodity?
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:38.180]   - In this case, when a worker is being hired for a job, yes.
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:42.260]   - So the worker's labor has an exchange value
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:43.580]   and a use value as well?
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.420]   - Yeah.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.060]   - Use value, use value of a worker's labor.
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.500]   Exchange value.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.220]   Let me think about that.
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:56.740]   So the hours they put in--
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:57.860]   - Is the use value.
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:59.940]   - Interesting.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:04.940]   So what does the worker want in this?
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:06.020]   What are the motivations?
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.820]   Are we not considering the worker in this context
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:09.660]   as a human being?
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:11.980]   - Well, you come, and that's actually,
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:13.700]   that's the next layer.
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:17.020]   What Marx gave was just like a layered cake,
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.180]   starting from a foundation of saying
[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:21.020]   straight commodity exchange,
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:22.780]   and then saying, well, you're treating a worker
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:23.900]   as a commodity.
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:27.260]   Now, a commodity is something like this.
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.700]   Okay, that has, so far as I'm aware, no soul, okay?
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.620]   Not gonna be complaining if I turn it upside down.
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.300]   It'll fall over, but it, yeah.
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.740]   So there's no soul there.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:39.540]   As a human, it's both a commodity and a non-commodity.
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:41.580]   And therefore, there'll be a tension in the person.
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:43.100]   I'm being treated as a commodity here.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.180]   I'm being paid just enough to stay alive.
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.700]   I've got a wife and kids back at home.
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:52.300]   So that is another layer of thinking in Marx.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.580]   And on that layer, he then says, well,
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.900]   workers will therefore demand more than their value.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.740]   - So that's when you get like political.
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:01.020]   - You get political, and you get money coming above that,
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:01.860]   and so on.
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.020]   But the basic idea starts from the commodity
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.140]   is the fundamental unity in capitalism.
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:11.540]   The important commodity in Marx's thinking was the worker,
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.260]   because that's where he said profit came from, okay?
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:16.580]   And then that explains the motivation of the capitalist,
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.020]   and that ultimately leads to the labor theory of value,
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:22.260]   and Marx's arguments about how capitalism
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.380]   will come to an end.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.540]   - Okay, okay, okay.
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:27.700]   So first of all, what is the labor theory of value?
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:30.620]   And actually, before that, what is value?
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:34.340]   Is that, this is like me asking what's happiness.
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.780]   Is there something interesting to say
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.620]   about trying to define value?
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:41.940]   - You vary, and this is a huge problem in economics,
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:45.020]   is arguments of what does value mean?
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:48.340]   And the neoclassicals came down as that it's subjective.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:51.020]   It's value is whatever you get out of it.
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:54.020]   It's your personal evaluation of something,
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:55.420]   your personal feelings.
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.540]   So they've got that very subjective idea of value,
[00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:02.420]   whereas the Marxists, being inheritors of the classical
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.300]   school, talk in terms of objective value.
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.340]   So the value is the number of hours it takes
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:10.660]   to make something, or the effort.
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:13.740]   The value is the effort that goes into making something
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.060]   in the classical school.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:17.780]   - Well, that's just one measure of objective.
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.540]   Where do you fall?
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.860]   Where do you fall?
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:21.700]   - I fall on--
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:25.700]   - Subjective versus objective spectrum of value.
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.500]   - I think you have to have the capacity to move
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.700]   between one and the other in a structured way.
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:31.740]   - A key model of value.
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:35.020]   - Yeah, well, my base model is the objective, okay?
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:37.100]   But above that, as soon as you start talking,
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:39.020]   you said about the worker, for example,
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:42.580]   then you get involved in the subjectivity,
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:47.580]   because a worker will be angry, and justifiably so,
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.260]   about being treated as a commodity.
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:53.140]   Because I'm not a commodity, I'm a human being, okay?
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:56.180]   And that's where Marx saw political organization
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:57.020]   coming from.
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.860]   And that's subjective now.
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:01.700]   And then when you get to money itself,
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:05.100]   Marx actually said, "Well, what's the value of money?"
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:07.180]   Now, if you use an objective theory of value,
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.540]   you would say, "Well, the value of money
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.220]   "is its cost of production.
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.860]   "What's the cost of producing a dollar?
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:15.020]   "It's about two cents."
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:18.060]   So he said, "It can't be, the value of money
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:20.260]   "cannot be its cost of production."
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.260]   Or, "There must value,"
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.260]   I think if I remember the phrase properly,
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:25.860]   or "is value here, as it must mean,
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:30.060]   "the effectively uncertain expectations
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.940]   "or subjective valuation."
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:35.620]   - Uncertain expectation or subjective valuation, okay.
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:36.700]   But he was okay with that?
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:38.180]   - He was okay with that, because he could move
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.460]   between different levels.
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.420]   Because he had a structured foundation
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.460]   of this dialectical vision.
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.340]   Foreground, background tension.
[00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:49.820]   Commodity, having use value, exchange value,
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:51.660]   and a gap between the two.
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.300]   When you're talking about machines,
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.100]   when you're buying stuff for production.
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.860]   And then, at the next level,
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.300]   he could look at workers, worker organization,
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:03.420]   and say that's driven by being treated as a commodity
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.900]   when you're a non-commodity.
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:09.740]   - So the basic labor theory of value
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.700]   that is described to Karl Marx
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:14.420]   is that value at the base layer
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:19.420]   fundamentally comes from the labor you put into something.
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:23.540]   And you say, well, there's some deep truth there,
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.060]   except he misses one fundamental point,
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:30.300]   which is machines can also bring value to the world.
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.820]   He was saying they don't.
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:38.540]   The only thing that matters is human labor, not labor.
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:41.060]   How do you measure what's the role
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:44.580]   of whatever value machines bring to the world?
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.860]   - Okay, this is another intriguing history
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.460]   because Marx, when he first started,
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:55.380]   had what you can call an exclusivist explanation
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:57.500]   for why labor created value.
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:01.700]   And that was to say that labor is the only commodity
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:05.420]   with both what he called commodity and commodity power.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.740]   So you have labor and labor power.
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:11.740]   Labor is the, and I get fuzzy about this,
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:13.860]   I haven't read it for something like 30 years,
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.940]   but labor has both commodity and commodity power.
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:19.900]   The commodity is you can buy labor,
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.940]   which is the means of subsistence.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:25.180]   Labor power is the capacity to work inside a factory.
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:27.220]   There's a difference between the two.
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.580]   Therefore, that difference will give rise to surplus.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:31.220]   And there's no other commodity
[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:34.220]   that has this essence of commodity and commodity power.
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:36.380]   So that was his exclusivist argument.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.980]   In the middle of the 1857,
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:42.780]   he was visited by a guy called Otto Brauer
[00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:44.820]   in his home in Chelsea.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:49.820]   And Otto returned to Marx a copy of Hegel's,
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.480]   I think it's called "Phenomenology of Right."
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.300]   I haven't read it, but that's the book.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.580]   And Marx was then at this stage
[00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:58.420]   reading through all the classical theorists again.
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:01.260]   And he was, suddenly he read Hegel again.
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:02.820]   And if you know Hunter S. Thompson?
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:03.700]   - Mm-hmm, of course.
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:04.540]   - Okay.
[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:06.340]   - Who doesn't know Hunter S. Thompson?
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:08.340]   - Somebody who hasn't had enough drugs, obviously.
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:09.180]   - Yeah.
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.000]   - But Hunter S. Thompson--
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:10.840]   - He comes to you in a dream
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.100]   after you take your first--
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.500]   - Mescaline or whatever.
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.340]   - And of course we've all--
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.700]   - If you know your drugs well enough,
[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.980]   you can tell, okay, he's stoned, okay, he's on cocaine.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:21.180]   Well, Marx suddenly, his writing style
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.100]   in the middle of a book called "The Grundrisse"
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.220]   completely changed.
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.060]   - He switched from weed to cocaine.
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:28.180]   - He switched from Ricardo to Hegel.
[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:29.860]   Okay, and what in Ricardo,
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:31.900]   he had this exclusivist argument about labor.
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:35.860]   And suddenly Hegel is back talking in terms of dialectics,
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:37.140]   not actually using a word,
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:40.100]   but foreground and background and tension.
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.900]   And then he, that's where this use value,
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:44.940]   exchange value, tension thing came from,
[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:47.580]   is rereading Hegel 13 years after
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:48.980]   he stopped reading philosophy.
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:53.340]   'Cause made in '44, he was reading just the economists.
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:55.660]   - So you're saying Karl Marx is human after all?
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:56.500]   - He's human.
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:57.320]   - He could be--
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.180]   - I would love to have a beer with Karl, for a while.
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:00.020]   - For Karl?
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:00.860]   He's Karl to you?
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:01.700]   (laughing)
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:03.460]   - He's Mr. Marx to me.
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:04.300]   - Hang on.
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.580]   Maybe Karl to me, I'm afraid, after all these years.
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.420]   - Yeah, yeah, you've had quite a journey together.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:11.700]   So that's where, after Hegel,
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.020]   his interpretation of the dialectics comes
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:16.260]   in the form of foreground and background.
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.620]   - And then on page 267 of the Penguin edition
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:21.180]   of "The Grundrisse."
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.580]   - Literally, your memory--
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:24.300]   - One and a half pages, long footnote.
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:25.340]   It's pretty hard to forget.
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:28.540]   'Cause when I did this, when I first read Marx
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:32.300]   way, way back when I was, how old was I, 20?
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:35.140]   Okay, I tried to explain my explanation
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.840]   of Marx's use value, exchange value stuff
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.760]   to my colleagues in this philosophy discussion room
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:43.140]   at Sydney University during a beautiful summer
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:47.260]   that we were inside concrete sandstone walls discussing Marx.
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.840]   And I went to say, look, the use value,
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.380]   exchange value argument can be applied to a machine.
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:53.980]   What's the exchange value of a machine?
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.460]   It's cost of manufacturing it.
[00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:56.700]   What's its use value?
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:59.740]   Its capacity to produce goods for sale.
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:01.740]   No relation between the two, there'll be a gap.
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.060]   A machine can be a source of profit.
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:05.900]   Now I said that and I got laughed at.
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.680]   I quite literally laughed at.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.460]   So when I went back to university 13 years later
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:14.400]   to do my master's degree, I chose to read through
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:18.540]   and find in Marx where he first came across this insight.
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.940]   So I made it, my first master's thesis failed, by the way,
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:23.180]   and justifiably so.
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.140]   I was learning, I didn't know the level
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:29.860]   of academic discourse necessary.
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:32.860]   I had an advisor who didn't understand what I was writing.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:36.860]   He got me to write for his New Keynesian audience
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.420]   and it was a mess and it got failed.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:40.260]   So I got rid of him.
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.980]   - Did it get failed because, like, why do you think?
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:44.380]   - It wasn't a good thesis.
[00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:45.980]   I didn't know the level.
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:49.120]   It was written for an audience my supervisor thought
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.740]   that I should be writing for and it was a mess.
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:54.880]   And so I met another guy, Jeff Fishburne,
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:59.340]   as a lecturer at New South Wales University.
[00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:00.740]   And Jeff was open-minded.
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:04.460]   He was not a conventional neoclassical thinker.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:06.380]   And I realized I'd throw out the half
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:09.700]   that Bill had got me to do, focus just on Marx.
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:12.980]   And so I decided to read Marx in chronological sequence
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:15.020]   from his very first works of economics,
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:17.300]   which are called the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:18.820]   of 1844.
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.460]   And he wrote those in a garret in Paris
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:23.700]   after he'd been expelled from Prussia.
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.380]   And so he decided to read the,
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:28.100]   having been an expert on philosophy
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:30.860]   and regarded as the towering intellect
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.980]   of Hegelian philosophy in Prussia,
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.660]   but driven out because he was a radical.
[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:39.700]   He ended up running a newspaper
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:41.580]   or writing for a newspaper.
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:44.660]   And he was reporting about the eviction of peasants
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:48.180]   from the forests, taking away their feudal rights.
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:51.380]   And so this is where his passion for economics
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:52.940]   and humanity came from.
[00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.140]   And he was a poet as well.
[00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.660]   I mean, he wrote love poetry to Jenny von Westhalen.
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.140]   That's his first published works
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.860]   were pretty much in poetry.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:05.180]   He was a rouse about, he was a wild character.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:07.900]   We'd probably fight like crazy, I imagine, if we met.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.300]   - Over the beers?
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.300]   - I'm slightly, even though I can be,
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:17.300]   I can get involved in an argument like nobody's business.
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.220]   - No, really?
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.060]   - No, really.
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.580]   I'm a bit more peaceful of personality.
[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:23.300]   - Oh, you think Marx is feistier than you?
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:27.460]   - He was feisty, but feisty with, he could be arrogant.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.980]   Like I've got intellectual arrogance.
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.580]   I've come to accept that.
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.860]   - But there's like a fundamental humility to you.
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:37.060]   You're saying Marx is like, has ego that's hard to control.
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.300]   - A bit too big ego, yeah.
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.660]   I'm guessing, I mean, I'm never gonna meet him.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:42.380]   - Well, the beard says ego to me.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:43.700]   - The beard is huge, yeah.
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:46.860]   - Okay, so this is interesting.
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.780]   You went chronologically--
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:49.620]   - Right through his works.
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.820]   - The development of the human being through his works.
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:53.340]   - Yeah, and I was trying to find the point
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:56.420]   at which he discovered this use value, exchange value idea.
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:00.860]   And it occurs in a footnote on page 267 to 268
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.540]   of the Penguin edition of the "Grundrisse,"
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.660]   which his notes he was taking,
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.180]   literally not meant for publication,
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:09.360]   literally sitting at a stall inside the British Museum,
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.980]   I think, reading all the classical authors
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.500]   in chronological sequence.
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.580]   And then somebody throws Hegel at him
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.580]   and suddenly he's talking in Hegelian terms.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.600]   And he suddenly says, is not,
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.540]   'cause it's whole value issues, what is value?
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:26.100]   Is it exchange value, use value,
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.340]   how do they relate to each other?
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:28.700]   That's what he was thinking about.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.580]   He said, is not use value,
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.620]   which was left out of the classical school,
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:36.260]   a fundamental aspect of the commodity?
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.300]   Is there not a tension between the use value
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.660]   and exchange value?
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.540]   - Just so we're clear, in that context,
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.000]   use value is kind of the subjective thing,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.060]   exchange value is the objective thing.
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.060]   And Marx found a way to integrate the two.
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:54.060]   - Well, he was focused on labor being the only thing
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:56.420]   that can generate both the use value
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:57.260]   and the exchange value.
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.320]   - But, no, if you look at the classical school,
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.540]   they focused on exchange value, objective.
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:04.900]   Look at the neoclassical,
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.620]   they focused upon use value, subjective,
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.220]   or they call it utility.
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:12.160]   So Marx, coming from the Ricardian tradition,
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.780]   basically dismissed the role of utility.
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.100]   And then, when he reads Hegel,
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:20.260]   he's suddenly starting to think in terms of unities,
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.260]   and exchange value and use value
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:23.740]   is the unity of the commodity.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:27.740]   And he thinks, well, I can't ignore use value.
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.660]   So rather than leaving it out completely,
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.660]   which is what Ricardo and Smith does,
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.040]   I've got to somehow bring it in.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.540]   And this Hegelian insight occurs to him.
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:37.420]   And it's remarkable,
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.040]   I really recommend taking a look at the book,
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.160]   even just to look at that particular page,
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.340]   because what it would have been,
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.840]   it's shown as a footnote,
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.220]   but it would have been him saying,
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.260]   oh, wow, and he's asterisk, asterisk,
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:51.540]   is not use value a fundamental aspect
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.380]   of the unity of a commodity?
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.900]   - So in the notes, you see the discovery of an idea
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:57.020]   in the human mind. - And it's beautiful.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.420]   - The integration of an idea.
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:59.260]   - And he actually writes,
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:02.100]   does this have significance in economics, question mark.
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:04.560]   - And then he probably went home that night,
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.500]   and that idea changed him.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.780]   - Yeah, it changed him completely, okay?
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:09.620]   And from that point on,
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.220]   his writing was completely different,
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.120]   but he still had this idea from the Ricardian days
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.920]   of saying that labor is the only source of value,
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.680]   using an exclusive argument to say
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.760]   there's something unique about labor
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.880]   that explains why it's a source of value.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.520]   But suddenly this insight occurs to him,
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.040]   and he thinks, I can get a positive derivation.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.040]   I can use use value and exchange value,
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.040]   and the fact they're not related to each other,
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.000]   as a dialectical tension to explain surplus value.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.200]   And that's what he does.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.260]   So he goes from a negative explanation
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:41.800]   of where value comes from to a positive explanation
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:44.400]   on that page of the Grundrisse.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.600]   And he then triumphantly uses it
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.420]   to explain why labor is a source of value.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.320]   You buy it for its exchange value,
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.640]   you use its use value, they're unrelated,
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:55.020]   the use value will be bigger,
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.640]   that's where profit comes from.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.320]   Then he does exactly the same thing for machinery,
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.200]   about 30 pages on.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.400]   He says, it also has to be contemplated,
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.680]   which was not done before.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.700]   This is right nice to himself, by the way,
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.500]   it's written in really in a colloquial style,
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:14.100]   that the use value of a machine
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.340]   significantly greater than its exchange value.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:17.700]   He actually left out the word is.
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:20.160]   It's use, this is obviously to be determined,
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:23.060]   it'd be a translation into English of the German, I'm sure.
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.780]   I don't know, I haven't seen the original notes,
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.980]   I'd love to see them.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:29.180]   But he says, he leaves out the word is.
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:32.780]   It also has to be contemplated that the use value
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:35.460]   significantly greater than its exchange value,
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:39.160]   i.e. that the contribution of the machine to production
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.020]   exceeds its depreciation.
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:46.240]   And that was an insight which undermined
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.840]   his explanation for revolution.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.520]   - Okay, can you say that again?
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.960]   The cost of production exceeds its depreciation?
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.800]   - Yeah.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.960]   - Is that, okay, can you linger on that?
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.560]   - Well, what Marx argued, and you read this in "Capital,"
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.920]   and I read this in "Capital" when I first saw
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.040]   the contradiction in his own thought.
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:10.520]   He said that no matter how useful a machine is,
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.800]   whether it has, took 100 hours to make or cost 150 pounds,
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.160]   it cannot, under any circumstances,
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.420]   add more to production than 150 pounds.
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:26.620]   Which, in his old exclusivist logic, he could justify,
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:31.380]   and which in his post-1857 argument is bullshit.
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.180]   - Can you steel man his case?
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:36.000]   Can we go to the mind of Marx in thinking,
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.420]   if a machine costs 100 bucks,
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:43.200]   it can't be ever more, bring more value than 100 bucks.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.400]   - But that contradicts his previous logic,
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.600]   'cause what he said is,
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:51.800]   you'd have a, commodities the essential unity in capitalism.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.800]   Capitalism focuses upon the exchange value.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.600]   That pushes the use value into the background,
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.700]   and there's a tension between the two.
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:02.360]   What that means is the exchange value of a commodity
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.140]   sets its price.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.520]   The use value is independent.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.880]   He called them incommensurable.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.040]   He literally would use the word incommensurability
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.200]   between exchange value and a use value,
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.380]   whereas neoclassicals make them commensurable.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:19.140]   So he's saying exchange value and use value incommensurable.
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:22.800]   And that normally means that exchange value is objective,
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.080]   like the number of hours it takes to make something.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.940]   Use value is subjective, how comfortable the chair is,
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:30.160]   the fact that you can sit in a chair.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.480]   So that's incommensurability.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.960]   But when you apply it in production,
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:36.680]   the exchange value of something is objective.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.800]   It's how many hours it takes to make a machine,
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.680]   or how many hours it takes to make
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.640]   the means of subsistence for a worker.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.760]   The use value is also objective.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.620]   You're making commodities for sale.
[01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:49.500]   And the worker does six hours.
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:53.940]   Six hours of work will make the means of subsistence
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:57.480]   for the worker, but the worker will work a 12-hour day,
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.560]   and the six hours becomes a gap.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.640]   Now, that's incommensurability between use value
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.800]   and exchange value of labor.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.360]   But when you look at what he said about
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.120]   no matter how long it takes to make a machine,
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:13.240]   or how many pounds it costs, he's saying they're identical.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.200]   And that's contradicting his own logic.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.080]   - Well, what's the use value of a machine?
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.780]   - The fact that it can produce goods for sale,
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.320]   exactly the same as the worker.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:27.080]   Now, what I've, in my modern reinterpretation of Marx,
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.460]   which brings in my work on energy,
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:34.460]   I see both labor and machinery as a means to harness energy
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:36.480]   and produce useful work.
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.120]   And they can both do that.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.320]   In fact, they do it together.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.220]   It's a collective enterprise.
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:44.200]   - Okay, so, and we'll go to that.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.800]   So there's no fundamental difference from an exchange value
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:50.160]   and use value perspective between a human and a machine.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.920]   - And therefore, they're using the same logic.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.000]   They can both be a source of surplus,
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.960]   which is what Marx contradicted,
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.860]   because his explanation for where socialism would come from
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.140]   is that only profit comes from,
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:03.580]   like profit comes only from labor.
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.360]   Over time, we'll add more machinery than labor.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.060]   That will mean a falling rate of profit,
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:11.060]   and therefore, a tendency towards socialism.
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:13.420]   And what he did in that insight in 1857
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:18.060]   is contradict his own idea about what would lead to socialism
[01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.380]   and he couldn't cope with it.
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:24.380]   - Okay, what's the difference between Marxian economics
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:30.020]   and Marxist political ideology?
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:33.900]   The gap between the two, the overlap, the differences, what?
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.580]   - The real foundation of Marx's political philosophy
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:40.040]   was the economic argument that there would be a tendency
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.580]   for the rate of profit to fall.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:45.480]   And that tendency for the rate of profit to fall
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:49.940]   would lead to capitalists battening down on workers harder,
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:52.300]   paying them less than their subsistence,
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:55.580]   a revolt by workers against this,
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.300]   and then you would get socialism on the other side.
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:02.420]   So what he called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:04.660]   played a critical role in his explanation
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:07.340]   for why socialism would have to come about.
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:09.060]   - He was saying it would have to come about
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:11.660]   or is it a good thing for it to come about?
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:12.980]   So it should come about?
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:15.580]   - He had a should, but he was trying to say it must.
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:21.040]   So if you look at Marx in the history of radical thought,
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.780]   he was preceded by what were called utopian socialists.
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:27.580]   Saint-Simon, even the Cadbury's company
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.620]   came out of utopian socialist.
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:32.340]   And they had an idea about a perfect society in the future
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.340]   where people were properly rewarded,
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.640]   were treated as human beings
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.380]   rather than cogs in a machine and all this sort of stuff.
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:40.060]   And they said socialism should come about
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:43.580]   because it treats humans better than capitalism does.
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:47.580]   Marx said, "I can prove that socialism must come about."
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:51.060]   So he preferred, he had a utopian vision
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.700]   of a future society,
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:54.980]   but he thought he could prove that it had to come about.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:59.020]   And the proof relied critically upon
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:01.040]   tendency for the rate of profit to fall.
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.980]   And that relied upon labor being the only source of profit.
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:07.740]   - What was his utopian view?
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:10.760]   So this idea from each according to his ability
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.100]   to each according to his needs.
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:16.060]   Is that the utopian?
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:20.260]   - I think it's utopian in the context of our modern world.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:23.820]   It says that you rather than being rewarded,
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:27.180]   like Jeff Bezos gets enormous fortune,
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:31.780]   you get what you need, not what you want necessarily.
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:33.620]   All needs is fulfilled.
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:35.220]   It was a vision of utopia
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.820]   where you could be a fisherman in the morning,
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.060]   a poet in the afternoon and a chef at night.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.760]   Okay, this paraphrasing one of his phrases.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.680]   So he did have a utopian vision of a future society.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.440]   And he did think human creativity
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.760]   did much, much greater under socialism
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.280]   than it was under capitalism.
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.120]   He was wrong.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.040]   - So let's explore in different ways where he was wrong.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.740]   You're saying there's a fundamental flaw in the logic,
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:02.720]   but also if we can link,
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.000]   if we can explore a high level philosophical concepts
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.240]   of socialism to like the dreams of a utopia.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.680]   First of all, what is socialism?
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:15.960]   That's another loaded term.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.800]   - It is socialism,
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.640]   particularly in America is a very loaded term.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.160]   And what Americans call socialist
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:26.160]   is a large amount of provision of services by the state,
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:28.160]   which is commonplace in Europe.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.040]   It's still moderately commonplace
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.840]   in my own home country of Australia.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:37.840]   And that Americans will call public education socialist.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.880]   It's a total parody of the word.
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.720]   Strictly speaking, what socialism meant
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:46.840]   is the public ownership of the means of production,
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.760]   no private ownership of the means of production.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.280]   - What is the means of production?
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.320]   - Machine factories, factories.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.640]   - So all the goods that are produced in factories,
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.400]   no, the means of producing the goods
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.360]   is owned by a centralized entity.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.120]   - Yeah, centrally planned.
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.640]   This is what actually was done under Gosplan
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.520]   under the Soviets.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.880]   And even with a collective farms as well,
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.520]   you no longer owned, you all own.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.920]   The state owned the land, you worked on the land.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.400]   And this was supposed to be a utopia.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.240]   - Right.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.320]   - Now it didn't turn out to be one.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.160]   - And we'll talk about maybe your ideas
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.400]   of why it didn't turn out to be one.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.800]   So the fascists did the same.
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.560]   So it's this fascism also.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:31.040]   - Fascism, so-called national socialism.
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.800]   It's also a kind of socialism.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:35.280]   - So yeah, but there was no, it wasn't public ownership.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.760]   There was public direction.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.160]   So the state would tell factories what to do
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.680]   with a still private profit.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.560]   And a large part of why the Nazis succeeded
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.960]   was the extent to which they managed to co-opt
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.560]   major manufacturers in Germany.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.720]   So it's, you know-
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:51.720]   - Direction versus ownership.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.960]   It's a dictatorial, I mean,
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.440]   that's a very particular implementation.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.400]   So you have to consider the full details
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.360]   of the implementation,
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.360]   but it's basically dictator guided.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.280]   - Yeah, and if you wanna take-
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.280]   - Versus owned.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.960]   - If you wanna take a proper vision,
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.880]   then you have to say it's the ownership
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.800]   of the means of production by the state,
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.960]   versus the ownership by private.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.320]   That rules out the Nazi period.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.640]   They use the word that, again,
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.160]   they're bastardizing as much as Americans do
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.520]   in the opposite direction.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:26.000]   - Well, what does ownership exactly mean?
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   - Well, it became incredibly complicated.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.520]   And this is actually the best work on this
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.760]   is done by a recently deceased Hungarian economist
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.560]   called Janos Kornay.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.800]   And Kornay tried to explain why socialism failed.
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.520]   Because-
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.280]   - Why did socialism fail in your view?
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.320]   In his view, in Janos' view, in your view?
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.040]   - I think Janos is 100% correct.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.920]   And it's a brilliant piece of work.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.760]   So I'm gonna be really paraphrasing his view.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:57.320]   And he imagined an ideal socialist society
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.400]   and there wasn't a Stalin, there weren't purges.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.560]   And you lived up to all the ideals
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.400]   that Marx had for socialism.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.880]   So he said, but you do it in a context of a economy
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:10.560]   which is incredibly primitive, Russia.
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.800]   Because if you look at Marx's own vision of the revolution,
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.360]   it was gonna happen in England.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.240]   The advanced economies would be first
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.880]   to go through the revolution.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.000]   The socialist, the primitive economies
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.320]   would have to go through a capitalist transition.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.160]   And this is the difference
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.680]   when the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.600]   So the Mensheviks, and Hyman Minsky
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.280]   came out of the Menshevik family.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.640]   The Mensheviks believed you had to go
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.160]   through a capitalist phase.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.920]   Russia had to go through a capitalist period
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.560]   before it becomes socialist.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.120]   The Bolsheviks believed they could get there in one go.
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.160]   Bypass the capitalist phase,
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:45.480]   do the development under socialism
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.120]   rather than under capitalism.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.960]   And this is what Yanis was actually analyzing.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:54.840]   You start from a primitive, feudal economy,
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.760]   very little industrialization,
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:01.760]   and you wanna jump to an advanced industrial society
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.360]   from that foundation.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.480]   So he said, what you have then for
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.920]   is a whole range of industries,
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.920]   all of which need as much resources
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.720]   as you can get for them.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.720]   So you wanna develop agriculture, mining, industry,
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.560]   every little division of it.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.560]   They all have legitimate demands
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:24.120]   on the resources of the country and the state.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.920]   That means that all your resources are fully employed
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.160]   and are properly over-employed.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:32.880]   So you have a resource constraint in that society.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:35.640]   The easiest way to cope with a resource constraint
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.200]   is to produce last year's commodity,
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.680]   not to innovate, not to make change.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.000]   So what that will give you is as you start to add,
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.040]   you invest, so you now have beginnings of a steel industry,
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.360]   beginnings of a car industry, and so on,
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.720]   you start investing, but you continue producing
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.400]   the same product you made last year.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.800]   And I have a perfect personal example of that,
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.400]   which I'll throw in now if you like,
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.280]   'cause we're getting pretty heavy conversation.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:04.600]   One of my first major girlfriend had a brother
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.560]   who wanted to get a motorbike,
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:11.280]   but he couldn't afford a Honda or a Kawasaki.
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.480]   At the time, they cost about $3,000
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:17.000]   for a 650cc Japanese motorbike.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   He found he could buy a Cossack for $650, $1 per cc.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.560]   So I was there when I got-- - $1 per cc, I guess.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:30.240]   - This is in suburban Sylvania waters in Sydney.
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:35.240]   So this crate arrives with a Cossack motorbike inside it.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.960]   So we take it apart, it's then got all these wooden palings.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.320]   We have to pull off the wooden palings to open it up.
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.560]   Then there's oil-soaked rag over this thing,
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.760]   which is tied on a wooden base.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.600]   We take the oil-soaked rag off,
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:50.480]   and we stare in all its glory in a 1942 BMW.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:51.320]   - Yeah. - Okay?
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.120]   It was exactly the same as Steve McQueen in "Great Escape."
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.600]   So the Russians for 30 years
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.320]   were making the same bloody motorbike.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.320]   It had a bicycle seat.
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.280]   - Yeah. - Okay?
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.920]   And that's how they coped.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.520]   They just made the same damn machine every year.
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.960]   They said, "So that's the outcome.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.120]   "You actually want the best possible world.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.280]   "You're trying to build as fast as possible.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.320]   "You're paying workers as high wages as you possibly can,
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.920]   "and that leads to a world where you don't innovate."
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:22.680]   But he said, "Capitalism, on the other hand,
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.280]   "pure capitalist economy,
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:26.800]   "you're trying to pay workers as little as possible.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.440]   "You have competitive industries.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.200]   "You're trying to take demand away from your rivals.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:36.200]   "You have Kawasaki versus Honda versus BMW, et cetera,
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.240]   "et cetera.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.920]   "The way you get demand away from your competitors
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.640]   "is by innovating.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.160]   "So what you will get is cycles and burns and slumps,
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.720]   "but you'll innovate and change over time."
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.400]   So what you found was this huge gap
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:52.800]   between socialist volume production with no innovation
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.640]   and capitalism with innovation.
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.080]   So that was the fundamental failing
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.760]   that Jonas Cornay saw.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.800]   So why did socialism not innovate?
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.840]   'Cause if you go back to this famous historical incident
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.440]   with Khrushchev in the United Nations,
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.520]   bangs, takes off his shoe and bangs the desk,
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.320]   says, "We will bury you."
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.040]   He literally meant, "We're gonna bury you in commodities.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.480]   "We're gonna produce more output than you are."
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:18.360]   And he was wrong.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:22.160]   - Because fundamentally, in the long term,
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:25.280]   to bury somebody in commodity production,
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.600]   you have to innovate.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.560]   - Yeah, and there's also,
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:32.080]   there's another remarkable Soviet engineer
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.960]   who was given the job of interpreting Marx's ideas
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.560]   of industrial sectors.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.200]   So he had the commodity sphere, the industry sphere,
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.440]   sector one, sector two, sector three.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:43.960]   Sector one, producing consumer goods.
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.680]   Sector two, producing capital goods.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.760]   Sector three, producing luxury goods for capitalists.
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:51.880]   And so he had a three-sector model of the economy,
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.240]   and he was talking about the dynamics between them.
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:57.280]   And what Feldman did was reinterpret this
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:58.880]   as an engineer would reinterpret it,
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.880]   which was brilliant work.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.280]   So what he said was,
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:05.360]   "You need to produce the means of production.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:06.840]   "If you wanna grow quickly,
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.020]   "you focus on producing the means of production
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:10.580]   "rather than commodities.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.480]   "So you don't make cars, you make car factories."
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.880]   Okay, you make a few cars,
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.640]   but most of the effort goes into expanding
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.360]   how many factories you have.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.200]   And what he did was do a mathematical model
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.860]   where you'd start off with very low levels
[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:23.320]   of consumer good output,
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.320]   but then you would just go exponential.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.040]   Now, I took a look at that
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.840]   back when I was doing my master's degree,
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.040]   the training in mathematics.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.520]   I took Feldman's equations
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:36.840]   and then looked at what was actually driving it was.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:39.080]   He was imagining, correctly,
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.480]   a huge pool of unemployed labor.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.020]   If you go back to the earliest stages
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:45.680]   of Soviet industrialization back in 1917,
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.320]   post the Second World, post the First World War,
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.160]   you had all these unemployed workers,
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.120]   you had all these peasants you could take off the land
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.480]   and put into factories.
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.200]   So you had a huge supply of workers.
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.160]   What you had to do was build the factories.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.720]   So you're building the factories,
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.740]   but at a certain point you exhaust the supply
[01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:07.880]   of lowly employed or unemployed labor.
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:11.320]   And so rather than having this exponential takeoff,
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.480]   you hit a ceiling.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.720]   And then you can only grow as fast as the population
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.720]   because you're not innovating.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:20.240]   So that's what actually hit the Soviet system.
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:23.800]   And it's why they never buried the Western consumer goods
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:27.520]   and instead why Eastern consumers looked in envy
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:30.360]   at the goods being purchased by their Western people
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.840]   and said, "If that's exploitation, we want exploitation."
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:36.440]   - So, okay, this is a lot of interesting stuff to ask here,
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:41.440]   which is, so Marx's vision for the socialist utopia
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:46.560]   is you have to go through capitalism.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:50.200]   And then Trubik's were true to Marx's original idea.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.280]   - Right, so is there a case to be made
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.560]   that in the long arc of human history
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:59.080]   on human civilization on earth,
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:03.920]   that we're going to live out Marx's vision for utopia,
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:07.400]   which is, will we run into a wall with capitalism?
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.240]   - I think we are running into a wall with capitalism.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.840]   In fact, I think we've already gone through the wall
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.440]   and we haven't yet realized we've smashed our skulls.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.280]   - Okay. - Okay.
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.000]   (laughing)
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.680]   But on the other side, we're bleeding
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:19.960]   and everything like that,
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:25.600]   does Marx have any insights on what the other side of,
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:26.440]   what is beyond capitalism?
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.920]   - I think that beautiful phrase of,
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.960]   "From each according to his ability,
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:32.200]   "to each according to his needs,"
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:36.040]   describes what we should end up with.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.200]   And I think that's actually, if I think about,
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.360]   you know I'm an Elon Musk fan,
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.520]   that's what I think is partially going to be
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:46.920]   the nature of society if we build one that functions on Mars.
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:49.600]   Because, and I've actually seen an interview with his,
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:52.520]   the Italian who's involved in designing
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:55.040]   what the future colony will look like.
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.640]   He was actually asked this question,
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.320]   "Can there be enormous inequality in Martian civilization?"
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.080]   The guy said, "Absolutely not."
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:06.000]   Because the resources, again resource constraint applies.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.680]   You simply can't give somebody an underground bunker
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:13.000]   100 times the size of somebody else's 100,
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.760]   an underground bunker.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:17.840]   There's a, the scarcity of resources
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:22.240]   imposes a need for equality overall.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.920]   - Is that always, that's interesting.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:26.360]   I mean the scarcity of resources,
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.240]   wait, but I feel like that's the contradiction.
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.080]   I thought--
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.720]   - Are you thinking neoclassical about scarcity?
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.880]   - Yeah, I'm barely thinking at all.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.120]   (laughing)
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:38.240]   So wait,
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:42.280]   I thought scarcity, the best way to build
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.880]   on top of scarcity is a capitalist type of machine.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:47.000]   - No, this is where again,
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.040]   our vision of what scarcity is, is wrong.
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.920]   Because, and Ricardo said this,
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:54.400]   but it's actually better than Marx.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.000]   'Cause Ricardo said there are some products
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.320]   whose value is determined entirely by their scarcity.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.240]   - Yeah.
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:06.120]   - Paintings, rare wines, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.920]   He said, "They are things you cannot reproduce
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.000]   in a factory."
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.600]   He said, "The essence of capitalism
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.640]   is what you can make in a factory."
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.960]   And therefore, for these unique objects,
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:18.080]   these rare objects, Picasso painting,
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:22.280]   a beautiful bottle of wine, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:25.760]   then the utility, it can't be reproduced easily.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:28.960]   So its price will be determined by subjective valuation.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.720]   He said, "What we're talking about in capitalism
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:33.000]   is the stuff you can make en masse."
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.520]   And that is the true focus of the capitalist economy.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:38.960]   And that is not about scarcity.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.120]   That is about, the only scarcity applies
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.640]   when you don't have the resources to make them anymore.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.280]   Or you can't use the energy involved
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.760]   because you'll damage the biosphere too much,
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.600]   which we've already done.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:54.600]   But fundamentally, the scarcity that neoclassicals
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.960]   have made us think about, and Austrians think about as well,
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:58.920]   is non-reproducible.
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:01.000]   But the essence of capitalism is the commodity,
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   the backscratcher, the two-buck backscratcher.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.840]   Anybody can, you know, the cheapest chips to make,
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.600]   and that's why you can make a profit out of them.
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:12.000]   Not the elaborate gold thing with diamonds and rubies
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.360]   that only the king gets.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:17.200]   So we think, our vision of scarcity has been perverted
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:20.400]   by neoclassicals, analyzing the exception to capitalism
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:21.840]   and calling it capitalism.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.840]   - Okay, fair enough.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.920]   So, you know, let's put Mars aside,
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:29.600]   'cause I think there's a lot of strange factors
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:34.200]   that have to do with a whole 'nother planet, civilization,
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.240]   that we don't quite understand.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:42.240]   Like how economics works with different
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:47.080]   geographic locations, one of which have new challenges,
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.200]   which is what essentially this is.
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:50.640]   I don't know if you can apply the same economic theory--
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.480]   - No, I'm saying, your question, I think,
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.120]   we'll be forced into that ultimately
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:58.240]   by having to make a compromise with the ecology.
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:01.480]   And we've been ruthless about the ecology of this planet,
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.520]   and we're gonna pay the price for it.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:08.520]   So if you have a planet where you can't be ruthless,
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.240]   okay, well, yeah, okay,
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.800]   you have to mine it as carefully as possible.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:17.240]   Then that utopian might be imposed upon you
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.400]   for the needs for survival on that planet.
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.600]   Back here, Marx's utopia was still the one
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.360]   that ignored the ecology.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:30.360]   And I think if I have a vision of a utopia in future,
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:34.000]   it's got bugger all to do about what humans get out of it.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.240]   It's what humans respect.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.920]   They have to respect life.
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:41.720]   So I don't see that as, I see that as a one-eyed utopia,
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.040]   a utopia for a single species,
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:47.640]   as if it can exist on its own, which we should know it can't.
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:48.640]   - Quick bathroom break?
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:49.480]   - Yeah, I'm gonna bathe myself.
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.200]   - That would be great.
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.400]   We took a little bit of a break, and now we're back.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.400]   We needed to take a break 'cause my brain broke,
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.480]   and I'm piecing it back together.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:02.120]   You mentioned ecology and life and the value of all of that.
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:04.760]   We'll return to it if we can.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:09.760]   But first, we said why this kind of,
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:15.760]   this idea of why socialism failed.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.920]   Can we linger on this a little bit longer?
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:23.820]   And how did the ideas of Karl Marx lead to Stalinism?
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:26.400]   So this particular implementation.
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:27.220]   - Yeah.
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:31.620]   - Is there something fundamental to these ideas
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:36.620]   that leads to a dictator and that leads to atrocities?
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:39.140]   There's something about the mechanism of the bureaucracy
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:44.140]   that's built that leads to a human being
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:49.160]   that's able to attain, integrate absolute power,
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:54.140]   and then start abusing that power, all that kind of stuff.
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:56.860]   Like some of the history of the 20th century
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:01.380]   is that inextricably connected to the ideas of Karl Marx?
[01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:02.660]   - I think to some extent it is,
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:05.140]   but I'm gonna also say that if it hadn't been
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:07.820]   for the Bolsheviks interpreting Marx
[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:09.260]   and saying we can reach socialism
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:11.300]   without going through capitalism,
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:14.440]   then it might not have happened.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:17.460]   So if you look at the, like the Mensheviks
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:21.540]   were a rival political group in Russia,
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.020]   and that's where Hyman Minsky,
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:24.780]   who's a huge inspiration for me--
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:26.940]   - So he's an economist who was maybe,
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:29.460]   can we take a little tangent, who was Hyman Minsky?
[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:32.180]   - Yeah, Hyman Minsky was the person
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:35.660]   who developed analysis of capitalism
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:37.400]   based on financial instability.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:42.820]   And he was actually the PhD student of Joseph Schumpeter,
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:45.820]   and an Austrian economist as well,
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:47.720]   whose name I've forgotten temporarily.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:53.700]   And he asked him, his parents were both refugees from Russia,
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:57.340]   during the Stalinist period,
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:01.360]   because the Mensheviks were being wiped out in Russia,
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:05.340]   just like any other opponents to the Bolsheviks
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:06.900]   were being eliminated.
[01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:09.340]   So I think his parents met in Chicago,
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:13.980]   still remained socialist, still remained politically active,
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:16.820]   and he was educated in a family
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:20.740]   that was just imbued with Marx as its vision.
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:23.640]   He ended up fighting in the Second World War,
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:25.920]   on the American side,
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:30.140]   coming back to America and studying mathematics,
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:32.780]   and then also doing an economics degree,
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:34.560]   leading to a PhD.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.400]   And the question he posed for himself
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.280]   is what causes Great Depressions?
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.980]   And he put it beautifully, he said,
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:42.940]   "Can it happen again?"
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:44.740]   It being the Great Depression.
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:46.380]   And if it can't happen,
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:49.380]   then what has changed between the society
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:52.220]   before the First, Second World War and after
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:54.820]   that makes a depression impossible?
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:56.300]   - What's the answer to those two questions?
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:57.140]   Can it happen again? - His answer was,
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:00.260]   "Yes, it can happen again."
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.100]   But what has prevented it happening
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.740]   by the time he started writing about it,
[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:08.740]   which was the late '50s to the mid '80s, late '80s.
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:12.100]   We met once, but only once.
[01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:13.260]   - Over a beer? - Huh?
[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:15.300]   - Over a beer? - No, he gave a seminar
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:18.460]   at New South Uni, and he bit of an obstreperous bastard.
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:21.300]   - What's, a stripper? - Obstreperous.
[01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:23.020]   - Wow, what is it? (laughing)
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:26.460]   - It means argumentative and likely to dismiss you.
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:28.420]   So like a good mate of mine was the guy
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:30.580]   I brought him out to Australia, a guy called Graham White.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:31.940]   We're still, g'day, Graham.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:33.580]   We're still good mates. - G'day, Graham.
[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:34.420]   (laughing)
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:35.740]   I love your language and your accent.
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:37.860]   - It's a great, actually, there's a really good TikTok
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:40.380]   I saw earlier today with an Aboriginal guy
[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:41.820]   saying he loves the Australian language
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:44.260]   because it's absolutely ironic.
[01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:45.860]   You ask an Australian a question,
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:46.740]   and he'll give you an answer,
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:48.420]   which is the opposite of what he means.
[01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:49.940]   You've got to work out the rest for yourself.
[01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:50.900]   - Yeah. - So he goes up
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:53.060]   to another Aboriginal mate and says,
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:53.900]   g'day, mate.
[01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:54.740]   He says, how are you today?
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:55.580]   Oh, not bad.
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:56.460]   What have you been doing recently?
[01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:57.300]   Oh, not much.
[01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:00.140]   When are we going?
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:02.620]   Not too far, not too soon.
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:03.460]   Where is it?
[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:04.300]   Oh, not too far away.
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:05.140]   And it's all negatives.
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:07.820]   And he's a beautiful, beautiful rendition.
[01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:08.980]   - Yeah, that's the cool thing
[01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:10.700]   about the internet culture.
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:13.260]   - They appreciate that ironic side.
[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:15.740]   Like for example, the best compliment you can give
[01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:18.940]   as an Aboriginal to somebody else is that's deadly.
[01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:20.300]   - That's deadly. - That's a compliment.
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:21.700]   That's deadly, okay?
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:24.380]   Another mate of mine comes to the Australian language.
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:26.340]   If I call you a bastard, that's a compliment.
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:28.900]   Yeah, depending on how I intonate the word bastard.
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:33.380]   - Bastard, bastard, that's deadly.
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:34.620]   - Yeah. - I love that.
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:36.740]   And there's something, unfortunately,
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:39.660]   there's something about the British accent
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:41.900]   that makes people sound
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:46.980]   maybe brilliant, maybe sophisticated.
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:49.620]   - But actually pompous.
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:54.020]   - Yeah, no, that's unfortunately the downside of that
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:55.500]   is you can sound pompous.
[01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:57.900]   There's something about the Australian accent
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:00.100]   that you just can't sound brilliant.
[01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:03.100]   (laughing)
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:04.140]   It humbles you.
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:06.580]   You sound like you're having a lot of fun.
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:09.020]   There's wit, there's all that good stuff.
[01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:10.980]   But you just can't be like,
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:12.540]   Karl Marx in an Australian accent
[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:13.620]   would just not come off.
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:14.700]   - That is a very good point.
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:17.260]   - He would not be able to pull off the beard.
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:19.660]   I mean, I just, yeah, it's fascinating
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:22.100]   that the accent determines
[01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:25.620]   something about the person.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:27.140]   Maybe it's the chicken and the egg too.
[01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:29.340]   It drives the way of the discourse.
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.620]   Obviously, there's a lot of brilliance.
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:32.220]   There's a lot of brilliance in your work.
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.020]   But it sounds like you're always having fun.
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:36.340]   - Yeah, and look, this,
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:38.540]   Poncho's got a lot of Australian mates here.
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:41.140]   He spent, what about, how long in Australia?
[01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:43.860]   A year and a half, and he's got all these mates
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:46.060]   who replace Aussie Rules Football in Austin.
[01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:47.220]   You should join them one day.
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:48.060]   - Oh, whoa.
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:49.060]   - It's actually rough.
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:50.500]   It's a very creative sport.
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:51.500]   It's much more fun.
[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:52.700]   - It's different than rugby?
[01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:53.540]   - Oh, very.
[01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:54.580]   Rugby is hopeless.
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:58.380]   Rugby is two morons smashing their bodies against each other.
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:31:59.860]   - Easy now, easy now.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:01.020]   - Sorry, sorry.
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:04.420]   - We do not mean to offend the rugby fans in the audience.
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:07.380]   Well, okay, so it's too simplistic.
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:08.460]   - It's too simplistic.
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:10.260]   I mean, there's skill in it.
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:12.540]   I've seen some really skillful rugby union
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:14.780]   and rugby league players in my day.
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:17.340]   But fundamentally, if you hit somebody hard enough,
[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:18.780]   they go down.
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:20.580]   Okay, whereas in Aussie Rules,
[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:23.180]   it's about catching the ball and then kicking the ball.
[01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:24.140]   - More skill, less power.
[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:28.860]   - More skill, and the bodies of the athletes.
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:30.580]   I can actually get off and you measure
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:32.980]   what a sport is like by the bodies it creates.
[01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:35.540]   And you get these incredibly elegant,
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:38.940]   lithe muscular forms out of Aussie Rules.
[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:41.140]   - Such beautiful words you have in your vocabulary.
[01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:42.860]   Lithe, I don't even know.
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:45.940]   But I'll assume you know what it means
[01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:47.380]   and maybe somebody in the audience.
[01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:51.100]   Okay, so, all right, fine.
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.660]   We should also mention that you, in your youth,
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:59.020]   like last year, had Olympic weightlifting
[01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:01.060]   as part of your life.
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:02.620]   - Long time ago.
[01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:03.860]   - And like you said, tennis.
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:06.740]   I also played tennis for many, many, many, many years.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:08.980]   - Yeah, it's a fascinating game.
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:09.940]   - It's a wonderful game.
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:11.460]   Yeah, that's my favorite game.
[01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:18.100]   - Karl Marx and Stalin.
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:18.940]   - Yeah.
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:21.260]   - So how do we get onto Aussie football
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.900]   and Australian and the accent?
[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:23.740]   - I'm not really sure.
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:26.220]   You talked about the way I said something
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:28.100]   about Karl Marx and with Karl Marx.
[01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:29.380]   Anyway, we got there.
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:31.500]   - Yeah, we got there and now we return.
[01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:32.860]   - But back to Marx, I think--
[01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:33.940]   - It's not the destination, it's the journey.
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:37.500]   - I think Marx, the failure of socialism
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:40.220]   with Janos Kornai captured beautifully.
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:41.980]   This idea already called demand-constrained
[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:44.460]   versus resource-constrained economies.
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:48.460]   And capitalism is demand-constrained, okay?
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:50.260]   And this is, again, where neoclassical theory
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:53.180]   is completely wrong, empirically completely wrong.
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:55.300]   So the neoclassicals have a vision
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:57.300]   of capitalism being resource-constrained
[01:33:57.300 --> 01:34:00.860]   and it's about maximizing your usage of resources
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:02.500]   subject to constraints.
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.220]   And as Kornai said, that's really what happened
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:05.380]   under socialism.
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:09.540]   What happens under capitalism is that you have 15,
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:11.540]   20 companies producing automobiles.
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:14.220]   They are all trying to capture as much
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:15.620]   of the market as they can.
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:17.020]   If you add up their marketing plans,
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:20.780]   you're gonna get 120, 130% of the actual market.
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:23.020]   So they're all gonna have excess capacity.
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:24.840]   When you build a factory, you're building it
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:27.880]   with a plan for it to exist for five, 10, 15 years.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.340]   You have to have excess capacity in the factory.
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:32.920]   So that means that capitalism has far greater
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:35.460]   productive capacity than it actually uses.
[01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:37.820]   And then the way that you manage to get demand
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:39.380]   into your factory is to innovate
[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:41.620]   and produce something nobody else does.
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:43.260]   Or you're producing in volume,
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:45.780]   and when somebody produces like a bung tire,
[01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:48.260]   comes out of firestone, then Goodyear is ready
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:50.860]   to expand its production and take advantage of that.
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:54.300]   So that's the actual nature of competition in capitalism.
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:57.340]   And that means that we get a cornucopia of goods,
[01:34:57.340 --> 01:34:59.200]   even if we're lowly workers.
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:02.380]   The variety of goods in capitalism is overwhelming.
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:05.020]   And that just doesn't happen in socialism.
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:08.940]   You get your 1942 Cossack as your motorbike, that's it.
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.940]   When you put your money down to buy a refrigerator,
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:12.980]   it'll arrive in 10 years
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:15.580]   because the factory is already fully constrained.
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:17.760]   So all these resource constraints
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:21.380]   mean that people aren't happy under socialism.
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:25.460]   And if you've got a whole bunch of people that aren't happy,
[01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:28.940]   then the best way to control them is to suppress them.
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:30.580]   So I think in that sense, ultimately,
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:33.980]   yes, it does lead to something like Stalinism.
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:36.520]   - So it's easier to give happy people freedom.
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.660]   - Yeah, I mean, happy people get pretty silly outside.
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:42.380]   I'm not particularly, the extent to which Americans
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:45.020]   overuse and distort the word freedom drives me balmy.
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:49.100]   - All of these words can be distorted,
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:52.940]   but they all at the core have some fundamental power
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:55.940]   and beauty, and then we just distort on the surface
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:56.780]   for the fun of it.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:57.740]   - Yeah. - We used to start battles
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:35:59.100]   on Twitter and so on.
[01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:01.500]   - But what citizens of the Soviet world didn't feel
[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:02.740]   was freedom. - Yeah.
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:04.860]   - Not just, first of all, it wasn't freedom
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:06.380]   to buy commodities.
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:08.020]   The commodities were supposed to be on the shops,
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:09.620]   weren't there.
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:11.340]   The volume couldn't be produced.
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:12.860]   And what you then got out of that as well
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:15.260]   was the classic Soviet joke,
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:18.020]   they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work.
[01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:18.940]   Okay.
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.540]   - Yeah, so you're not motivated.
[01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:23.860]   - Oh, look, I went to Cuba about eight years ago.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:25.820]   - Yep. - Invited to give a talk there.
[01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:29.460]   And I was staying in a hotel, itself the hotel's a story.
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:31.540]   There's one day my meetings were canceled.
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:33.620]   So I thought I might go down to the beach.
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:35.580]   And in the hotel, they had a wing,
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:36.780]   which is the tourist office,
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:39.220]   and there were three women working inside the office.
[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:41.060]   So I thought I'd just go up and ask them,
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:42.660]   how do I get to the beach?
[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:45.620]   And one of them says to me, and I stood there,
[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:48.020]   just stood in the room,
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:50.420]   waiting to see if they'd make eye contact with me.
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:52.500]   Three women, nobody else in the place.
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.060]   None of them looked at me.
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:55.500]   So I finally went up to one of them and said,
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.540]   I wanna go to the beach and do some surfing.
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:36:59.460]   She said, I can get a taxi outside.
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:01.860]   Now, fundamentally, she was saying,
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:04.020]   well, I'm being paid shit money here.
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:06.580]   I'm not gonna, I don't wanna work.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:10.460]   I'm not gonna do anything apart from sit here
[01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:12.780]   and qualify for my time.
[01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:15.260]   And as much as there are reasons the Cubans have suffered
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:17.740]   from American embargoes and all that sort of stuff,
[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:20.620]   you've still got that fundamental shortage economy
[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:24.860]   that Cornel spoke about coming out of the structure
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:27.100]   of central ownership and central control
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:28.780]   of distribution and investment.
[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:31.580]   - Breaks my heart because I think some of the effects
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:34.900]   of that persist throughout time.
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:36.660]   It become part of the culture too.
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:37.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.420]   - It's very interesting. - Negative culture.
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:40.380]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:43.020]   - Well, from the Western perspective.
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:44.780]   - Well, even from the people living through it.
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:48.060]   I mean, I had enough conversation with Cubans,
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:50.300]   meeting them on the street, hopping in a cab.
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:53.340]   One guy I was talking to,
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:54.820]   he was an industrial chemist
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:56.980]   and he got a bit of money being a cab driver
[01:37:56.980 --> 01:37:59.940]   because he could make money out of taking foreign tourists
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:01.540]   from the airport to the city.
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:03.660]   - By the way, this episode is brought to you
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:06.740]   by delicious Coca-Cola.
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:08.540]   (laughing)
[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:10.620]   - That's why I didn't wanna have it on camera, but anyway.
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:12.380]   - No, maybe they'll actually sponsor.
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:15.420]   You wanna make sure you rotate the label to show,
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:16.820]   this is capitalism.
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:19.420]   What are we talking about here, even though it's red?
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:23.380]   Red and black, it's actually anarchist.
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:24.340]   (laughing)
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:25.300]   - I should tell you,
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:27.180]   I don't know if you know who Michael Malice is.
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:28.020]   - Michael?
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:30.940]   - Michael Malice, he's an anarchist and he lives next door.
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:31.780]   - Does he?
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:34.980]   Okay, now I've lost touch with anarchist philosophy.
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:36.660]   I actually used to read, you know,
[01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.940]   Kropotkin and Bakunin and so on.
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:41.220]   And I enjoyed their philosophy
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:44.460]   and then I helped organize an anarchist conference once.
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:47.180]   And that was the biggest antidote possible
[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:48.420]   to being an anarchist.
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:50.660]   - That sounds like an entry point to a joke.
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:53.420]   You have to organize an anarchist party.
[01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:57.380]   - It is, I mean, we literally spent three days
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:38:59.500]   arguing over whether there should or should not
[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.740]   be a chairperson for conversations.
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:03.300]   - Yeah.
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:04.540]   Well, that may be that.
[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:10.420]   - Monty Python's "Life of Brian" was lived out live.
[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:15.500]   - Look at the bright side of life.
[01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:18.580]   All right, so part of that explains why, for example,
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:21.700]   even to this day in some of those parts of the world,
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:26.420]   entrepreneurship does not flourish.
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:28.900]   There's not a spirit in the people to start businesses,
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:31.620]   to launch new endeavors and all those kinds of things.
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:36.820]   We're just taking all kinds of strange little strolls,
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:41.820]   but how do you explain the mechanisms of China today
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:46.820]   where there's quite a bit of sort of flourishing
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:48.500]   of businesses and so on?
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:51.220]   It's a very peculiar kind of entrepreneurship.
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:53.100]   - They got away from central control,
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:57.140]   but they still manage central political control,
[01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:59.300]   but diversified economic control.
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:02.540]   - So there's a, you could, it is possible to draw a line
[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:03.380]   between politics and economics.
[01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:04.700]   - It is possible, and I think in some ways,
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:06.660]   China's more likely to survive as a society
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:11.660]   going into the future than Western capitalist societies are.
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:15.780]   - So it's like, if we do the Karl Marx,
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:18.900]   the foreground and the background,
[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:23.900]   you can centralize the humanity, the subjective stuff,
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:31.140]   and then distribute the objective.
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:32.580]   - You've got to have the goods,
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:36.440]   and that's why the big change from Mao to Deng Xiaoping
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:39.060]   was the characterizing that little saying
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:41.020]   that I don't care whether you have a black cat
[01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:43.820]   or a white cat so long as it catches mice.
[01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:45.600]   And there was a level of pragmatism
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:49.020]   to the Deng Xiaoping revolution over Mao,
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:50.940]   and Madame Mao in particular.
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:53.740]   And that was manifest in the desire
[01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:56.860]   to get as much of those Western goods as possible.
[01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:58.940]   And I was actually in China in '81,
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:00.940]   took a group of journalists there,
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:02.700]   as I mentioned earlier, for a tour,
[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:06.580]   and we ended up going to the Sichuan Free Trade Zone.
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:11.580]   And that gave us an idea of why China was gonna succeed,
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:15.780]   because they had a rule that you couldn't just come in
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:17.660]   and exploit the cheap wages.
[01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:20.280]   You had to also have a Chinese partner,
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:22.160]   and within five years, the Chinese partner
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:26.380]   had to own 50% of the business, which is huge.
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:29.300]   And it gives you an idea of the reduction in wages
[01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:31.040]   these American corporations are looking at.
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:32.160]   They'd shut down the factory
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.860]   in what's now the Rust Belt of America.
[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:37.100]   They might be paying somebody there,
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:39.900]   that time maybe $2 an hour,
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:41.320]   and they come across to China,
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:43.500]   and they're paying two cents an hour.
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:47.820]   So the enormous amount of wages that they dropped,
[01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:50.420]   they were willing to forego half the profits
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:52.180]   and the ownership of the firm.
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:53.220]   So what the Chinese were doing
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:56.640]   wasn't just exploiting their labor force,
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:59.620]   it was also building a capitalist class.
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:01.020]   And that meant that you had this,
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:04.220]   that's where all the Chinese corporations have come from.
[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:07.820]   So they were building a capitalist system
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:11.220]   within a socialist command political system.
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:14.400]   And that worked, and it's still working.
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.740]   So there was the centralization of the economic stuff,
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:18.400]   the Gosplan approach.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:21.380]   I think that was where the Soviet failed.
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:23.840]   And what the Chinese realized
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:25.700]   after what they went through under Mao
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:28.260]   was you have to have that capitalist period,
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:30.700]   but they weren't going to abandon the communist control
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:32.940]   politically of the country at the same time.
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:34.220]   And that worked out brilliantly.
[01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:35.660]   And there's a huge amount of innovation
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:37.780]   taking place in China today.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:42.100]   And they also will do gigantic infrastructure projects,
[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:44.620]   breathtaking planning going into that.
[01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:46.500]   If you've, you would have seen videos
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:49.580]   of building a skyscraper in a day.
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.340]   The planning that has to go into that,
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:54.220]   the pre-preparation that's necessary is enormous.
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:56.020]   So there's a real respect for engineers as well
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:58.860]   in that society, which does not apply in the West.
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:01.700]   - What do you think about the, from the Western perspective,
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:05.380]   the destructive effects of centralized control
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:07.600]   of the populace, of the ideas, of the discourse,
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:09.820]   of the censorship and the surveillance,
[01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:11.100]   all those kinds of things?
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:13.660]   - It's a bit like we were talking about Russia
[01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:15.740]   to some extent beforehand
[01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:19.280]   with centralized versus decentralized corruption.
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:25.100]   And when you had the centralized political stuff,
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:28.440]   means you know you can't criticize within China,
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:30.060]   but so long as you don't criticize,
[01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:31.620]   you can do what you like.
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:35.080]   - And how destructive is that to the human spirit?
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.140]   From the American perspective,
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:39.340]   that feels destructive. - I found some pretty,
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:43.500]   before, I've been to China quite a few times over my life,
[01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.900]   a lot in the last, not for about four years,
[01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:48.620]   but for the six years before that, a few visits.
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:53.620]   And I'd be staying in second and third and fourth tier cities
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:56.140]   so populations of only 4 million people,
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:58.740]   which is quite small on Chinese standards.
[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:02.220]   And I had a lot of happy people that I was interacting,
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:05.040]   my girlfriend at the time, her social circle.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.300]   And you can feel when people
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:09.760]   can't discuss a political issue.
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:13.040]   For example, in Thailand, you can't discuss the king.
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:16.240]   They still have less majest laws,
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:19.320]   so you can actually be jailed for discussing the king.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:21.440]   And you can feel that to some extent,
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.200]   and it is a political issue in Thailand now.
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:26.920]   But in China, what I got back from most people,
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:29.740]   it was a bit like a benevolent big brother.
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:33.480]   But then when you get things like the lockdown,
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:34.680]   which has applied recently,
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:37.960]   then you get the failings of the Soviet system
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:40.840]   is still there in the Chinese system.
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.040]   In that the easiest way to avoid criticism
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:47.800]   as a underling carrying out instructions
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:49.000]   of people above you,
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.600]   is to carry those instructions out to the letter
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:56.040]   beyond what the people actually want you to do at the top.
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:58.500]   So we had a classic illustration of that
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:00.200]   when I took these journalists.
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:02.160]   There was a news report saying
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:04.840]   that China's output of light industry
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:07.660]   had grown by 17% in the previous year,
[01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:10.160]   but heavy industry had fallen by 7%.
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:12.500]   We just don't compute.
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:14.180]   So we kept on asking, why did this happen?
[01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:16.960]   Every time we asked a question, this is back in '81,
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:18.400]   the answer would be the initial answer,
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:20.320]   we followed the directive of the Central Committee
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:21.920]   of the Communist Party of China.
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.200]   We finally got a guy to elaborate and say what that was.
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:28.320]   He said, "Well, the Central Committee sent out a directive
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:30.480]   "to promote light industry."
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.600]   "So what did you do?"
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:34.220]   Quote, unquote, "We stripped heavy industry factories
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:36.320]   "and turned them into light industry."
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:37.560]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:40.280]   Now that's destructive of everything, okay?
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:42.360]   And that's the overlay that you've still got
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:44.300]   sitting over the top of China.
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:46.440]   But a huge part of the industrialization
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:50.660]   was simply saying, produce whatever you can,
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:53.480]   make goods, market them, sell them.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:56.520]   And you get that innovative component
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:58.360]   of humanity is respected,
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:00.820]   and the goods turn up and everybody's well fed,
[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:04.540]   food in Russia is far better than food in America.
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:09.540]   So in terms of material satisfaction and freedom,
[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:11.960]   so like for example, enjoy dancing.
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:16.600]   I mean, we went to, I think somewhere in Shanghai,
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:18.520]   and there's this line of people
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:21.600]   involving a woman who would have been close to her 90s
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:24.160]   and a kid who was about six or four.
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.600]   - Partying it up. - Partying it up
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.960]   in the open air and doing this Chinese collective dance.
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:31.380]   - So you have to be really careful about that kind of thing.
[01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:36.380]   So in terms of measuring the flourishing of a people
[01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:43.080]   by looking at their happiness,
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:45.940]   I have so many thoughts on this,
[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:48.380]   but I'm imagining North Korea.
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:51.300]   And if you talk to people in North Korea,
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:55.820]   I think they would say they're happy.
[01:46:55.820 --> 01:46:56.660]   - No.
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:59.740]   - Well, let me try to complete this argument.
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:05.760]   Not an argument, but a sort of challenge to your thought,
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.780]   which especially in the bigger cities,
[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:11.320]   because they don't know the alternative.
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:14.400]   So what else do you need?
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:16.440]   There's enough food on the table.
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:20.140]   We have a leader that loves us and we love him.
[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:24.280]   We're full of, our hearts are full of love.
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:29.140]   Our table is full of food, they would say,
[01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:30.980]   because it's enough food.
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:34.660]   What else do you want from life?
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:36.340]   - No, I think, okay, like that's--
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:37.860]   - So let me sort of chat, because like--
[01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:38.820]   - That's an alternative.
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:41.380]   I mean, I've spent time in Romania.
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:44.140]   - So let me sort of complete that, sorry.
[01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:47.100]   'Cause I'm taking the most challenging aspect.
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:50.940]   When there's centralized control of information,
[01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:53.380]   that you don't know the alternative,
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:55.480]   that you don't know how green the grass is
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:56.900]   on the other side.
[01:47:56.900 --> 01:48:00.920]   And so your idea of happiness might be very constrained.
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:04.300]   So you could also argue that is happiness,
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:05.140]   if you don't know.
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:05.980]   (laughs)
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:07.340]   - Ignorance is bliss.
[01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:08.500]   - Ignorance is bliss.
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:11.780]   And then so is happiness really the correct measure--
[01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:13.740]   - It's not. - For the flourishing?
[01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:14.700]   - It's not.
[01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:18.260]   But I mean, there's actually a classic book,
[01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:21.900]   a movie as well, called "Mal's Last Answer."
[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:26.220]   - Okay, and that is a young man explaining his progression
[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:28.800]   from being a dancer in the Cultural Revolution
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:30.540]   through to a leading dancer in American
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:32.660]   and ultimately Australian ballet.
[01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:36.500]   And he explicitly says at one point
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:38.700]   that he's told that the Chinese people
[01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:41.060]   have the highest standard of living in the world.
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:42.540]   And the reaction of him and his kids,
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:44.220]   like his fellow six-year-olds is,
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:47.340]   "God, it must be miserable elsewhere in the world then."
[01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:48.660]   So they knew--
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:49.500]   - They still know.
[01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:50.320]   - They still know.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:52.480]   There's no such thing as that complete ignorance.
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:55.160]   But what I'm talking about is,
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:56.620]   and this experience is in China,
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:59.800]   say back in about 2016, 2014,
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:03.200]   there was a feeling of freedom
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:07.080]   within limits that you didn't wanna transgress
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:09.280]   because the system was working.
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:10.120]   So if you--
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:11.200]   - It's kinda like marriage.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:12.040]   - Pardon?
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:12.860]   - It's kinda like marriage.
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:14.040]   - Hey, that's a good example.
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.000]   (laughs)
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:15.840]   - There's limits.
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:16.660]   - There's limits.
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:17.960]   - You can have fun within those limits.
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:18.800]   - That's right, okay.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:21.880]   And people did have fun and they did feel free,
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:24.040]   but they didn't wanna go and get divorced.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:28.000]   But that dilemma was accommodated
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.120]   because the boundaries,
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:31.960]   until you started hitting restrictions, were wide.
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:33.120]   Okay?
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:34.200]   And when you look at it,
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.480]   I mean, look at the,
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:37.920]   again, with the Chinese Communist Party,
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.640]   the administrators of that
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:42.440]   are often highly qualified engineers
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:44.420]   who can then make intelligent decisions
[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:47.600]   about what should be done as infrastructure and so on.
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:48.840]   And you go to China and you've got
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:50.560]   an incredible high-speed rail,
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:54.680]   fantastic infrastructure,
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:57.080]   internet, telecommunications, and so on,
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:00.480]   rapidly evolving solar.
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:03.480]   There's a range of things there that are so well done
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:06.840]   that reflect the fact that the selection process
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:09.080]   that gives you your political elite
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:11.920]   is partially focused upon sucking up, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.000]   It's still there.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.720]   But it's also focused upon your skill levels.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:18.720]   And you get people making decisions
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:20.480]   who damn well know what they're talking about.
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:22.760]   Like Australia's got a classic example.
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:24.960]   The internet in Australia sucks.
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:29.360]   The reason it sucks is that the Labor Party,
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.680]   which is our version of the Democrats,
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:34.440]   was in control during the global financial crisis.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:35.920]   And as part of that,
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:40.880]   they wanted to bring in optical fiber connections
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:42.520]   to the house.
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:44.160]   So you'd have an optical fiber backbone
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:48.320]   and an optical fiber right to your T100 output
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:49.640]   from your home.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:51.880]   And the Liberal Party fought that
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:54.200]   and said that's gonna be too expensive,
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:55.560]   take too long to do.
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:58.560]   We're going to do cable to the node
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:00.840]   and then have a copper network linking
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:03.520]   from a node on a street to all the houses in the street.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.640]   It's gonna be cheaper and faster,
[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:07.160]   have it more soon, blah, blah, blah.
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.800]   It was a total technical fuck up.
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:11.080]   And Australia now has internet
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:13.800]   that's about 50th or 60th fastest in the world.
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.960]   It's dreadful for the internet.
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:18.480]   Two political figures made the decision,
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:22.040]   Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull,
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:26.160]   rivals and leaders of the conservative party
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:27.800]   we call Liberal over there.
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:30.360]   Now that was shitty decisions
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:34.160]   that wouldn't happen in a country like China
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:36.760]   because you've got actual engineers making the decisions.
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:38.840]   They say you can't get decent speed
[01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:41.440]   if you link optical fiber to copper.
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:44.200]   It's kind of, so what you get is
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:47.440]   even though you can't make the decisions yourself,
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:50.640]   a vast majority of the decisions are made intelligently
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:52.080]   and therefore you expect it.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:53.480]   - Yeah, it's interesting but
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:59.320]   don't you worry about the corrupting aspects of power?
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:00.160]   - Oh yeah.
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:02.520]   - That you start, you have engineers
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:04.680]   making intelligent decisions,
[01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:07.840]   but at which point does the fat king
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:11.560]   start saying, "Oh, these engineers are annoying.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:12.680]   "I have good internet.
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:14.080]   "I don't understand.
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:15.960]   "Bring me the grapes."
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:18.560]   - Well, that's, you get your colligular effects
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:19.480]   that can happen.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:22.200]   I like Z from what I've seen has got elements of that.
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:26.400]   So friends of mine who are Caucasians can get away with it.
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:28.680]   They have a game that they play at conferences
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:32.360]   scoring how often people use Z's name in a presentation
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:34.360]   and giving extra points for the number of photographs
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.280]   of Z that turn up in the whole thing.
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.680]   So you've got this sort of personality cult
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.120]   coming along as well.
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:43.040]   But at the same time, the planning for the infrastructure
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:45.320]   that's being built, the social services,
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:50.080]   the general freedom that exists is so great.
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:52.280]   And like any Chinese person alive today,
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:54.560]   like somebody who's Chinese my age,
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:53:00.600]   would have been an adult under the early period of,
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:02.280]   the late period of Mao.
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:04.200]   And God almighty, the change, the improvement
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:05.520]   they've seen in their lives,
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:07.120]   that's what they think about.
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:11.200]   - So, but it's the, if you just look at the history
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:14.120]   of the 20th century, your intuition would say
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:17.160]   that some of the mechanisms we see in China now
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:19.600]   will get you into trouble in the long term.
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:23.480]   So it seems to be working really well in many ways
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:26.120]   in terms of improving the quality of life
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:28.280]   of the average citizen in China.
[01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:31.080]   But you start to get worried about how does this go wrong?
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:33.760]   - Well, yeah, but at the same time, maybe, I mean,
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:35.080]   often people will say, you know,
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:36.720]   what's your vision for the future?
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:38.920]   And what they mean is, what vision for the future
[01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:41.120]   do you have that I'm gonna like?
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:42.080]   - Right. - Okay.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:44.320]   Now, what if you have a vision of the future
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:45.440]   you don't like?
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:46.280]   It's dreadful.
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:50.000]   When that's the ecological crisis
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.920]   I think we're walking blindfolded into.
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:55.600]   - Well, that's right, that part of the picture
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:57.640]   we'll have to talk about.
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.760]   How fundamental of a problem that is.
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:01.720]   Okay, but what does that have to do
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:02.560]   with the future of China?
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:04.200]   - Well, what it has to do is that if you wish
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:06.520]   to impose dramatic controls on the consumption
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:08.800]   of the rich, which would be necessary
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:11.720]   to reduce our consumption burden
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:15.600]   so that we can get closer to the ecological envelope
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:18.640]   we've destroyed already, then you're gonna make
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:19.960]   more likely successful doing that
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:22.800]   with a centralized system where people accept
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:25.520]   centralized political control than you were
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:27.280]   in a country where it's all diversified
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:29.720]   and you scream freedom between every point
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:30.560]   in a tennis match.
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:32.400]   And I've literally seen that when I was
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:34.240]   in Philadelphia some time back.
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:39.760]   So the ideology that accepts a collectivist attitude
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:42.040]   may be more successful in controlling
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:45.000]   our reducing human consumption levels.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.720]   'Cause when we talk about democracy,
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:49.200]   I mean, who's voting here?
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:54.200]   How many horses and elephants and birds get to vote?
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:56.880]   Okay, it's very--
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:57.960]   - What's a bird?
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:00.920]   - Yeah, you don't see them around here.
[01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:04.360]   It's a very human-centric vision we have of this planet.
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:07.760]   And we're gonna pay a price for that.
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:09.280]   - Okay, so you're saying to deal
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:12.400]   with global catastrophic events,
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:13.920]   centralized planning might be--
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:16.320]   - Maybe, I think will work better, period.
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:18.680]   I mean, again--
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:21.200]   - But there is some centralized stuff
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:22.400]   in the United States, for example.
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:23.880]   - Oh, your military, yeah, I know.
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:26.000]   - No, no, okay, all right.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:29.640]   Now there's that feisty Australian.
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:33.800]   So besides the military, that's the ideal
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:35.680]   of the federal government in the United States
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:40.560]   is that there is some centralized infrastructure building.
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:41.400]   There's some big--
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:43.120]   - There's not enough of it, yeah.
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:43.960]   - But there's some.
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:44.800]   - There's some.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:47.040]   - The question is when you deal with greater
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:49.920]   and greater global catastrophic events,
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:52.080]   like the pandemic that we're just living through,
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.640]   that the government would be able to step up
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:57.720]   and impose enough centralized planning
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:00.680]   to allow us to deal, sort of enable,
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:02.760]   empower the citizenry to deal
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:04.440]   with these catastrophic events.
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:06.680]   In the case of the pandemic, a lot of people argue
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:09.120]   that the, first of all, the world,
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:11.320]   but also the United States failed
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:15.560]   to effectively deal with the pandemic.
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:17.520]   On the medical side, on the social side,
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.520]   on the financial side, the supply chain, everything.
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:24.520]   In terms of communication, in terms of inspiring
[01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:29.240]   the populace with the power of science,
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:31.640]   on all fronts, they failed.
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:34.600]   But the ideal is that we'd be able to succeed.
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:36.720]   You would have to have a small, efficient,
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:38.680]   the ideal, the American ideal,
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:40.200]   is you have a small, efficient government
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:43.840]   that's able to take on tasks precisely like the pandemic.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:45.320]   - But the thing is, maybe it shouldn't have been
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:46.800]   as small as it was.
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:48.800]   I mean, my favorite instance of that actually involves
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:51.680]   the UK, because the whole neoliberal approach
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:54.240]   is about small, efficient government, okay?
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:56.080]   Well, small, efficient government works
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:58.440]   when you face small, efficient challenges.
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:00.760]   When you face something systemic,
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:03.760]   rather than episodic, then it's gonna break down.
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:05.360]   And like this is, I mean, one of the things
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:08.920]   I greatly respect is Taleb's idea of anti-fragile.
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:10.520]   You want a society which is anti-fragile,
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:11.880]   not easily broken.
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:13.440]   Whereas neoliberalism has pushed us
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:14.800]   towards this vision of efficiency,
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:16.360]   but it's easily snapped.
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:19.400]   Like in the UK, I've forgotten the government minister
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:23.840]   involved, but she asked her expert committee,
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:26.440]   "How many," this is well before the pandemic,
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:29.360]   "How many masks should we have on hand
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:31.040]   "in case of a pandemic?"
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:33.560]   And the answer from the experts was about a billion.
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:38.480]   Okay, that's 50 masks, that's 20 masks per person, okay?
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:39.800]   Oh, that's too many.
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:42.240]   Let's just make 50 million masks.
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:44.200]   That's one mask per person that was gone
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:46.400]   in a matter of a day, okay?
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:47.680]   And therefore, that's why they told us,
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:48.800]   "Well, masks don't work."
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:49.880]   You know, what they meant was,
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:52.880]   "We don't have enough masks for our health people,
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:54.360]   "let alone for you and the public.
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:55.400]   "So we're gonna bullshit you
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:58.040]   "and tell you those masks don't really work."
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:57:59.760]   And then people don't wear masks,
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:00.840]   and then we've got enough masks,
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:02.600]   we rush up the production job.
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:03.780]   And by the time it comes along,
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:05.920]   people have got the skepticism about masks.
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:08.280]   - So who does, can you elaborate,
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:10.200]   who does the blame in that case go on to?
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:11.640]   - The blame comes down to the philosophy
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:14.380]   that says government should always be small.
[01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:17.160]   - No, but do you really think that bigger government
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:18.680]   would be the solution to the mask issue?
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:20.240]   - No, but what if-- - So let me push back
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:23.200]   sort of if it's possible that capitalism
[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:25.040]   solves that problem.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:27.400]   - Not if, there's no money
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:29.980]   in really long-term planning in capitalism.
[01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:34.440]   Okay, there's money in, capitalism is--
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.360]   - Isn't it possible to construct,
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:40.120]   isn't possible for capitalism to construct a system
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:42.680]   that ensures against catastrophic events?
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:44.040]   - Not when they're systemic.
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:47.420]   You can ensure against episodic events.
[01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:50.040]   If you occasionally have a really bad storm,
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:52.360]   but in general, the weather's not so bad
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:54.400]   that all the infrastructure's being destroyed,
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:56.880]   then you can share that around on a percentage basis.
[01:58:56.880 --> 01:59:00.080]   If you have a Gaussian distribution for your events,
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:03.520]   and you don't, the mean doesn't move around too much,
[01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:05.920]   and the standard deviation doesn't change all that much,
[01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:07.660]   then insurance works fine.
[01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:09.600]   But if you have an, if that's episodic,
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:10.880]   if you have systemic stuff
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:13.080]   where the climate is changing completely,
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:16.500]   and you're gonna wipe out your agricultural capabilities,
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:19.760]   you simply can't do insurance on that front.
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:22.980]   You can't make a profit out of catastrophe in capitalism.
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:28.600]   - Okay, so that example of climate change,
[01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:29.600]   let's talk about it.
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:30.600]   - Okay.
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:34.040]   - So you mentioned that the human brain,
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:36.740]   the economy, and the biosphere
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:39.320]   are three of the most complex systems we know.
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:45.320]   Okay, and you also criticize the economics community
[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:50.560]   for looking at the effects of climate change
[01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:55.080]   when measured as the effect on the GDP.
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:58.520]   So you're saying it's a catastrophic thing,
[01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:01.280]   that the biggest challenge our society,
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:03.040]   our world is facing.
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:03.880]   Why?
[02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:05.680]   If the economists disagree with you,
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:08.580]   the effects on the GDP will be minor,
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:13.600]   so we'll deal with it when it comes.
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:16.000]   That's the argument against, that's the devil's advocate.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:19.680]   You're saying, no, it is a thing
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:22.400]   that will change our world forever
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:24.040]   in ways that we should really, really,
[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:25.720]   really be thinking about.
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:26.720]   Okay. - Okay.
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:28.400]   - Make the case of why you disagree with the economists.
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:29.520]   - The case is simple.
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:31.560]   Economists have made up their own numbers
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:34.040]   to say that it's trivial.
[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:35.680]   - And you didn't.
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:37.640]   - No, I haven't even tried to make the numbers.
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:39.320]   I'm reading what the scientists write.
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:40.300]   - Okay. - Okay.
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:42.560]   And what the economists have done,
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:44.880]   and like this is William Nordhaus in particular,
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:46.200]   Nobel Prize winner,
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:49.400]   ex-president of the American Economic Association,
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:50.640]   literally assumed that a roof
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:52.920]   will protect you from climate change.
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:54.800]   He didn't say it in those words.
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:57.680]   What he said was 87% of American industry
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:59.900]   occurs in carefully controlled environments,
[02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:02.320]   which will not be subject to climate change.
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:04.640]   Now, the only things that all of manufacturing,
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:08.000]   all of services, he included mining as well,
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.640]   forgetting about open-cut mining,
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:13.560]   government activities and the finance sector,
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:16.920]   all they have in common is they happen beneath a roof.
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:19.520]   So he's basically saying climate affects the weather.
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:21.400]   Climate is weather, okay?
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:25.880]   Okay, now that is not at all what is meant by climate change.
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:28.480]   It's mean changing the entire pattern
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:32.120]   of the weather system of the planet.
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:34.840]   For example, the most extreme form of climate change
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:38.020]   would be a breakdown in the three circulation cells
[02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:39.800]   that exist in each hemisphere,
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:42.160]   the Hadley cell, the Ferris cell,
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:43.680]   I think it's called, and the polar cells,
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:46.440]   zero to 30, 30 to 60, 60 to 90.
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:50.440]   Those are the main bubbles, if you like, in the atmosphere.
[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:54.140]   Now, if we get enough increase in the energy
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:57.360]   in the atmosphere, just like you turn the temperature up
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:01:59.880]   on a stove and you have nice bubbles occurring
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:02.080]   in a pot of soup and then turn the temperature up
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:04.840]   and they all break down and you've got bubbles everywhere,
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:06.520]   that's called the equitable climate.
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:09.920]   If that happens, then most of the rainfall
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:13.280]   is gonna occur between zero and 20 and 70 and 90,
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:16.300]   and the middle's gonna be dry, except for extreme storms.
[02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:23.000]   We built our societies in a period of extreme stability
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.720]   of the climate, and when you look
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:26.920]   at the long-term temperature records,
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:29.720]   it's up and down like a seesaw,
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:32.840]   like a sawtooth blade, between, say,
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:34.800]   one degree warmer than now and four degrees
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:38.840]   or six degrees cooler over the last million years.
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:40.640]   But when you look at where we evolved,
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:43.240]   it's just that a turning point on the peak
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:44.480]   of one of those ups and downs.
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:46.640]   So those, I've forgotten the name of the cycles,
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:48.480]   but the cycles caused by changes
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:50.520]   in the Earth's rotation around the sun.
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:56.400]   And so we evolved our civilization just at the top.
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:59.480]   So coming up from a cold period,
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:02.560]   and then we're gonna head down to another cold period,
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:04.520]   and that's when human civilization came along.
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:06.960]   It's about a period of about 12,000 years.
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:10.240]   So across that period, the temperature has changed
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:13.120]   by not much more than half a degree up and down.
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:15.240]   Now, we're blasting it well and truly out
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:19.240]   of those confines, and my way of interpreting
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:22.960]   what climate change means is the stability
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:24.680]   of that climate that enables to build
[02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:28.600]   sedentary civilizations and not be a nomadic species
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:30.160]   is being destroyed.
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:32.860]   - So the challenge, and by the way,
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:35.160]   I'm playing devil's advocate.
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:36.000]   - Go right ahead.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.600]   - The question is, is there something
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:42.240]   fundamentally different now about human civilization
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:46.760]   that we're able to build technology
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:50.840]   that alleviates some of the destructive effects
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:52.720]   that we have on the climate?
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:53.600]   - We don't know.
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:56.240]   And we're gonna find out the hard way.
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:59.000]   - And the uncertainty, you think, would be very costly.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:03:59.840]   - Extremely.
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:02.400]   - Like many of the trajectories we might take
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:05.360]   would be much more costly than they're profitable.
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:08.840]   - Yeah, and like, when we've seen some of the storms
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:10.240]   that are happening now in Europe,
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:12.840]   the ones that washed away a village in Germany
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:16.600]   some time ago, the firestorm that hit Canada of all places,
[02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:18.760]   I've forgotten the name of the town that was burnt down,
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:20.920]   but enormous temperatures in Canada.
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:24.760]   Again, the storms that are happening back in Australia,
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:27.320]   these are all manifestations of a complete shift
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:29.120]   in the weather patterns of the planet.
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:32.960]   And they can wipe out, like a village just disappears,
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:36.080]   just wiped out by unprecedented rains.
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:37.480]   And this keeps on happening.
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:41.960]   We are still living in a sedentary lifestyle
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:44.080]   when we're a nomadic species.
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:47.240]   So to be able to maintain that sedentary lifestyle,
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:49.400]   we do need to engineer the planet.
[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:51.480]   We need to keep it within that range
[02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:55.800]   of plus one, plus half a degree Celsius,
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:58.600]   minus half a degree, which is really what has been lost
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:00.400]   for the last 10, 12,000 years.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:03.080]   Instead, we're blasting it right out of that range.
[02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:07.320]   And we know some of the past climates that have existed then
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:09.320]   we can model what they imply
[02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:12.440]   for our food production systems, for example,
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:15.200]   not the only example, but obviously crucial.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:18.800]   So when you look at what are called global climate models
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:21.680]   produced by scientists, one of the examples,
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:25.560]   and it was published by the OECD last year, 2021,
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:28.320]   in the chapter on what would happen if we lose
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:32.320]   what's called the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:34.560]   or AMOC, and people would colloquially know that
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:35.840]   as the Gulf Stream.
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:37.880]   And that's what distributes heat
[02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:39.600]   around all the oceans of the planet.
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:41.600]   It's part of a huge chain
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:43.600]   called the thermohaline circulation.
[02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:47.240]   But the part that goes across from the equator
[02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:48.640]   to the North Atlantic,
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:52.800]   that's called the AMOC and Gulf Stream, colloquial way.
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:55.280]   If that disappears in the context
[02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:57.720]   of a two and a half degree Celsius increase
[02:05:57.720 --> 02:05:59.600]   in average global temperature,
[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:02.920]   then the proportion of the Earth's surface,
[02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:05.360]   which is suitable for producing wheat,
[02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:08.880]   will fall from 20% to 7%.
[02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:11.960]   Proportion for corn, similar sort of fall.
[02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:15.680]   The proportion suitable for rice will go from 2% to 3%.
[02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:17.240]   Now that means a catastrophic,
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:18.680]   and that's the word used in the report,
[02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:20.720]   catastrophic collapse in food production.
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:23.840]   So that's what we're toying with.
[02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:27.680]   And we are one and a half, we're actually less than,
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:30.920]   we're about halfway there to that two degrees, 2.5.
[02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:34.600]   And economists, on the other hand,
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:37.640]   and this is Richard Toll, okay,
[02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:39.840]   published a paper in 2016,
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:41.440]   claiming using what he calls
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:44.960]   an integrated assessment model that economists developed,
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:47.240]   that losing the Gulf Stream
[02:06:47.240 --> 02:06:51.040]   would increase global GDP by 1.1%.
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:53.720]   Now, his model, this is what really pisses me off
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:55.960]   about these people, it's the worst work I've read
[02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:59.040]   in 50 years of being a critic of neoclassical economics.
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:03.280]   The GCMs, the one scientists produce,
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:06.520]   of course include precipitation as well as temperature.
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:08.560]   The IAMs that the economists produce,
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:12.360]   and this is stated yet again in a paper in 2021,
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:15.080]   do not include precipitation.
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:17.040]   They simply have temperature.
[02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:19.920]   So they assume that if temperature improves
[02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:21.200]   by moving towards a temperature
[02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:24.240]   which is better for producing aquaculture,
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:26.640]   okay, then so will precipitation.
[02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:27.880]   Now that's completely wrong.
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:29.840]   They've left out a crucial,
[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:31.240]   imagine trying to model the climate
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:33.880]   while ignoring the fact that there's rainfall.
[02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:34.940]   That's what they've done.
[02:07:34.940 --> 02:07:38.000]   So their work is so bad, so dreadfully bad,
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:39.200]   it should never have been published.
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:40.720]   - So they over, all right, okay.
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:42.600]   - I'm gonna go for them, sorry, this is--
[02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:45.840]   - Well, no, no, 100% as they deserve it.
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:47.840]   So it's an oversimplification.
[02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:51.480]   But I also want you to steel man people you disagree with
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:55.140]   and criticize people you agree with if possible,
[02:07:55.140 --> 02:07:57.240]   to be sort of intellectually honest here.
[02:07:57.240 --> 02:07:59.440]   You do say, sort of to push back
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:03.420]   on the catastrophic thinking about climate change,
[02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:10.160]   that the ecology, the biosphere is a complex system.
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:14.940]   Economics, the economy is a complex system.
[02:08:14.940 --> 02:08:22.020]   So how can we make predictions about complex systems?
[02:08:22.020 --> 02:08:27.020]   How can we make a hope of having a semi-confident predictions
[02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:28.840]   about the complex system?
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:32.440]   So the scientific community is very confident
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:36.480]   about the complex system that is the biosphere
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:40.900]   and the crisis that's before us on the horizon.
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:46.120]   And then the economists are, as a community,
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:48.480]   I don't know what percentage, but--
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:49.480]   - Too much.
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:50.840]   - Too much.
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:54.220]   That part of the community is very confident
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:59.220]   looking at the economics complex system
[02:08:59.220 --> 02:09:04.260]   in saying that, no, this system we have
[02:09:04.260 --> 02:09:08.140]   of labor, money, and capital, and so on,
[02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:09.860]   we'll be able to deal with that crisis
[02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:11.700]   and any other crisis.
[02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:14.560]   And they kind of construct simplified models
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:19.220]   that justify their confidence.
[02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:21.380]   So how do we know who to believe?
[02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:23.500]   - For a start, if you believe the economists,
[02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:26.380]   you need your head read.
[02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:27.500]   - That's not an argument.
[02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:28.340]   - I know it's not an argument,
[02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:29.660]   it's a summary of an argument.
[02:09:29.660 --> 02:09:30.500]   And that is--
[02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:32.900]   - No, that sounds a lot like an opinion and an emotional--
[02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:35.060]   - I know, I know, 'cause I'm so angry about it.
[02:09:35.060 --> 02:09:37.940]   - Listen, I'll tell you where I stand.
[02:09:37.940 --> 02:09:43.880]   And I've begun studying the climate change much more.
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:49.180]   I used to be on things I don't understand,
[02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:52.060]   have not spent time on.
[02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:55.300]   I have so many colleagues that are scientists
[02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:59.560]   that I deeply respect, and I trust their opinion.
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:06.900]   I have seen the lesser angels of my colleagues
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:12.060]   on the pandemic side, on the COVID side.
[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:14.180]   The confidence, the arrogance,
[02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:17.540]   that in part blinded, I believe,
[02:10:17.540 --> 02:10:21.260]   the jump between basic scientific research
[02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:24.140]   to public policy.
[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:24.980]   - Yep, yep.
[02:10:24.980 --> 02:10:29.980]   - And then, so I've become a little bit more cautious
[02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:32.300]   in my trust on climate change.
[02:10:32.300 --> 02:10:33.800]   I'm still in the same place.
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:36.300]   And I don't mean climate change.
[02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:39.460]   On anything scientists say, I've become a little bit,
[02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:40.300]   wait a minute,
[02:10:40.300 --> 02:10:47.300]   how does the basic scientific facts of our reality
[02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:50.780]   map to what we should do as a human civilization?
[02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:51.620]   - Yeah.
[02:10:51.620 --> 02:10:52.820]   - There I wanna be a little bit careful.
[02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:56.340]   So whenever now I see arrogance and confidence,
[02:10:56.340 --> 02:10:57.460]   I become suspicious.
[02:10:57.460 --> 02:11:00.020]   - Well, I'm the same, and that's why I'm being angry
[02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:03.620]   about "The Economist," because there's incredible arrogance,
[02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:06.900]   incredible stupidity, the arrogance,
[02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:09.860]   assumptions which you look at it and think,
[02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:12.140]   how did anybody let that get published?
[02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:12.980]   - Sure.
[02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:13.820]   - Okay, that's what--
[02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:17.300]   - The economic analysis of the effects of climate change
[02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:19.020]   are poor, in many cases.
[02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:20.380]   - Incredibly poor.
[02:11:20.380 --> 02:11:23.460]   - And this is like, Bjorn Lomborg styles himself
[02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:25.340]   as the skeptical environmentalist
[02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:28.540]   and criticizes the environmental models.
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:30.100]   He doesn't take a look.
[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:32.980]   He doesn't criticize the work come out by economists.
[02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:35.200]   You look at it, it's so bad.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:38.400]   - Is it possible to do good economics modeling
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:40.340]   of the effects of climate change?
[02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:42.040]   - Yeah, it is possible.
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:42.880]   Very difficult.
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:46.060]   - Or is it like one complex system's tech?
[02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:47.380]   - It's two, in that case, yeah.
[02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:51.500]   To me, what you should be looking at is saying,
[02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:53.820]   what are the scientists saying are the consequences,
[02:11:53.820 --> 02:11:56.520]   probable consequences, not guaranteed,
[02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:00.940]   but probable consequences of increasing the energy level
[02:12:00.940 --> 02:12:03.420]   of the atmosphere by the amount we're doing?
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:06.780]   - What can the scientists say in terms of the effects,
[02:12:06.780 --> 02:12:07.940]   'cause it's so complicated,
[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:12.780]   the effects of sort of shifting resources.
[02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:15.580]   So basically, what are the effects of climate change?
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:16.900]   How can we really model that?
[02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:18.180]   Because it's basically,
[02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:21.180]   you're looking through the fog of uncertainty.
[02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:23.240]   'Cause there are rising sea levels.
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:26.580]   How can we know what effect that has?
[02:12:26.580 --> 02:12:28.540]   All we know, there'll be a lot of change.
[02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:32.380]   - Yeah, well, I think the sea level one is a poor argument,
[02:12:32.380 --> 02:12:33.940]   and I don't focus on it.
[02:12:33.940 --> 02:12:38.340]   What I mainly focus upon is the weather patterns.
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:39.660]   Okay, and if you look at,
[02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:42.140]   like we got the wheat belt in America
[02:12:42.140 --> 02:12:45.740]   goes through Idaho and places like that,
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:48.100]   and you've got an incredibly deep topsoil.
[02:12:48.100 --> 02:12:49.820]   Ukraine is another classic example.
[02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:53.300]   The depth of the topsoil in Ukraine is remarkable,
[02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:55.860]   and that's the wheat bowl of Europe.
[02:12:55.860 --> 02:12:58.340]   And that requires both the right temperature
[02:12:58.340 --> 02:13:01.100]   for growing wheat and the right rainfall for growing wheat.
[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:02.580]   Now, when we look at the models
[02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:06.860]   that climate scientists are building of that,
[02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:07.940]   you have pretty much,
[02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:11.220]   your ultimate foundation is the Lorenz model
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:12.800]   of turbulent flow.
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:15.180]   And of course, that's the first model
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:18.460]   which we saw chaos theory, complexity,
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:19.940]   that beautiful, simple model,
[02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:22.260]   three variables, three parameters,
[02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:24.500]   an incredible complexity out of the system.
[02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:29.740]   And what that meant was you also had an exponential decay
[02:13:29.740 --> 02:13:32.500]   in the accuracy of your model over time.
[02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:36.860]   So if you're accurate to a thousand decimal places,
[02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:41.020]   then in a thousand days, you'll have no data whatsoever
[02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:42.180]   because each time you're losing
[02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:44.540]   an order of magnitude of accuracy.
[02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:47.100]   So that's the point about the inability to predict
[02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:48.700]   for the very long future.
[02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:49.940]   But what you can just say,
[02:13:49.940 --> 02:13:51.700]   well, there's a prediction horizon.
[02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:53.140]   If we're close enough to the,
[02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:56.300]   if our statistical measurement of where we are
[02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:58.840]   is close enough to where we actually are,
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:01.700]   and our forecast horizon is narrow enough
[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:03.500]   to not extrapolate too far,
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:05.140]   then for this distance forward,
[02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:06.460]   we can make a reasonable fist
[02:14:06.460 --> 02:14:08.660]   at predicting what the weather's going to be.
[02:14:08.660 --> 02:14:11.260]   And that's the foundation of meteorological,
[02:14:11.260 --> 02:14:13.560]   the stuff we watch on TV.
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:14.700]   Most of the time,
[02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:17.100]   the forecasts are gonna be correct these days.
[02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:20.740]   40, 50 years ago, most of the time the forecasts were wrong.
[02:14:20.740 --> 02:14:24.520]   So that's the background foundation to these GCMs.
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:26.700]   But even they've got to massively simplify the world.
[02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:29.060]   So you have this enormous sphere
[02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:31.120]   where they might divide it down to 100 kilometer
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:35.220]   by 100 kilometer by 10 kilometer cube,
[02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:39.380]   rectangles, whatever, oblongs.
[02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:42.620]   That's how they're modeling the transition
[02:14:42.620 --> 02:14:45.720]   of weather from one location to another.
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:48.960]   So they've got a chunky vision of the planet,
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:50.600]   which they have to, they can't model it now,
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:52.260]   down to the last molecule.
[02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:53.620]   So you're losing-- - Well, not yet, right?
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:55.180]   It's getting better and better and better and better.
[02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:58.400]   - Oh, yeah, I think that's just too much processing power.
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:00.260]   But you're gonna have some confine.
[02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:02.520]   You can't go, I mean, if you look at the models
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:05.320]   to do the weather, they used to be of that 100 kilometer,
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:08.040]   I think they're about 10 kilometer grids now, I don't know.
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:09.960]   So the processing powers let us get
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:11.560]   more and more precise that way.
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:15.100]   I do know that the models now include chemical mixing
[02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:16.900]   that occurs above cities.
[02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:19.020]   They've added that complexity to them over time.
[02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:21.540]   - So you're looking at the increasingly accurate models
[02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:24.500]   of weather patterns, the effect they have on agriculture,
[02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:28.060]   on food, and you're saying that there's a lot
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:31.220]   of possibilities in which that's going to be
[02:15:31.220 --> 02:15:34.220]   really destructive to society on the food production side.
[02:15:34.220 --> 02:15:35.860]   - And if you have that increase in temperature,
[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:38.100]   they're gonna get a change in precipitation,
[02:15:38.100 --> 02:15:40.200]   and it could mean that where the rainfall
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:43.300]   and the sunshine are adequate for growing wheat
[02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:45.500]   is an area where there's no topsoil.
[02:15:45.500 --> 02:15:47.340]   It's like a huge part of the models,
[02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:50.500]   the models the economists use, which only use temperature,
[02:15:50.500 --> 02:15:52.300]   don't include precipitation.
[02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:54.940]   They predict that a large amount of the wheat output
[02:15:54.940 --> 02:15:57.420]   of the world is gonna occur in Siberia,
[02:15:57.420 --> 02:15:59.960]   in the frozen tundra.
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:03.500]   - What about, so that's a straightforward criticism
[02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:05.260]   of oversimplified models.
[02:16:05.260 --> 02:16:09.580]   What about the idea that we innovate our way out of it?
[02:16:09.580 --> 02:16:13.180]   So there's totally new, what is the,
[02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:17.520]   there's a silly, poor example at this time perhaps,
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:22.180]   but lab-grown meat, sort of engineered food.
[02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:27.180]   So a completely shifting source of food for civilization,
[02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:33.660]   so therefore alleviating some of the pressure on agriculture.
[02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:35.620]   - That comes down to the difference that Alan makes
[02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:40.220]   between producing a prototype and mass producing
[02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:41.540]   the prototype.
[02:16:41.540 --> 02:16:44.740]   You can develop the idea very rapidly
[02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:47.900]   to put that into production on the scale that's necessary
[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:49.460]   to replace what we're currently doing.
[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:50.300]   - It takes years.
[02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:51.740]   - Yeah, and we haven't got years.
[02:16:51.740 --> 02:16:53.260]   We've got, we might have decades.
[02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:55.020]   We certainly haven't got centuries.
[02:16:55.020 --> 02:16:57.980]   So in the timeframe we've got,
[02:16:57.980 --> 02:17:01.500]   I can't see that engineering going from prototype
[02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:05.600]   to production levels to replace what we're currently doing
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:08.420]   in the stable environment we're currently destroying.
[02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:10.340]   - What do you think about the sort of the catastrophic
[02:17:10.340 --> 02:17:13.460]   predictions that people that have thought,
[02:17:13.460 --> 02:17:15.500]   have written about climate, have made in the past
[02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:16.700]   that haven't come to fruition?
[02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:19.660]   - That's mainly unfortunately involving Paul Ehrlich
[02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:22.860]   and the population bomb, and the predictions Paul was making.
[02:17:22.860 --> 02:17:25.420]   - A few individuals, or the one individual in that case.
[02:17:25.420 --> 02:17:26.260]   - Yeah.
[02:17:26.260 --> 02:17:28.900]   - So I'm mostly playing devil's advocate in this conversation
[02:17:28.900 --> 02:17:30.160]   and enjoying doing so.
[02:17:31.580 --> 02:17:36.200]   I do think I'm in agreement with the majority
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:38.280]   of the scientific community.
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:40.720]   - But you still see that argument made.
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:42.640]   - I still see the argument made,
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:45.220]   and I also am a little bit worried about the arrogance
[02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:47.420]   and the ineffectiveness of the arrogance.
[02:17:47.420 --> 02:17:49.680]   - This is the problem, it's ineffective.
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:53.680]   And that's what worries me, because it's all been
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:59.820]   put into the sort of sea level rise, temperature changes.
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:05.520]   It's not put into the fragility of the system
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:08.140]   in which we currently live.
[02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:10.760]   And the earth will survive, and there's a wonderful
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:13.140]   science fiction book called "The Earth Abides"
[02:18:13.140 --> 02:18:15.740]   about a world in which humans get wiped out,
[02:18:15.740 --> 02:18:17.120]   there's only a tiny little band left,
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:19.120]   and then the earth reasserts itself.
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:20.780]   So the earth's gonna survive us.
[02:18:20.780 --> 02:18:22.300]   Will we survive what we do to the earth?
[02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:23.740]   That's the question.
[02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:28.740]   And my feeling is that we have underplayed
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:33.360]   the extent to which the civilizations we've built
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:36.220]   have depended upon a relatively stable climate.
[02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:38.820]   And there's that turning point in the maximum,
[02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:40.460]   in the global average temperature,
[02:18:40.460 --> 02:18:42.380]   that we evolved right on the top of it.
[02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:45.420]   And if we had done nothing, we could find that
[02:18:45.420 --> 02:18:47.580]   heading back down towards another ice age
[02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:50.980]   could equally destroy the possibility of sedentary life.
[02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:53.060]   For example, if we'd never developed
[02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:55.580]   fossil fuel-based industries,
[02:18:55.580 --> 02:18:57.900]   we'd never built superphosphate,
[02:18:57.900 --> 02:19:01.660]   so our population would never have reached 1 billion people.
[02:19:01.660 --> 02:19:04.800]   And we were still living like fairly sophisticated animals,
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:08.940]   but you know, like 17th century level of load on the planet.
[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:11.780]   Then we would have gone down, that decline.
[02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:14.700]   And the approaching ice age would have started
[02:19:14.700 --> 02:19:16.940]   to wipe out our farming areas,
[02:19:16.940 --> 02:19:18.740]   the glaciers would have encroached,
[02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:20.420]   and we would have been driven out of
[02:19:20.420 --> 02:19:23.860]   like an agricultural sedentary civilization by that change.
[02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:26.020]   So it's just the fact that we evolved
[02:19:26.900 --> 02:19:28.500]   on this stable period
[02:19:28.500 --> 02:19:31.020]   in the overall temperature cycle of the planet,
[02:19:31.020 --> 02:19:33.420]   and that stability is something
[02:19:33.420 --> 02:19:35.340]   which just reflects the turning point
[02:19:35.340 --> 02:19:38.220]   in the regular cycle of Malicevic cycle,
[02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:39.940]   I think it's called, I've forgotten the actual name,
[02:19:39.940 --> 02:19:42.780]   but it's a cycle caused by, you know,
[02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:44.980]   change in the Earth's orbit around the sun,
[02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:47.340]   reflectivity and so on.
[02:19:47.340 --> 02:19:52.340]   That cycle, it's just that tiny top bit that we evolved in.
[02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:54.060]   So what we should have done,
[02:19:54.060 --> 02:19:55.860]   and so that's really useful for us,
[02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:57.780]   we should stay at that level.
[02:19:57.780 --> 02:19:59.860]   Now, if we hadn't done it, we'd go back down here,
[02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:02.540]   and that'd be the end of our civilization by an ice age.
[02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:05.980]   Instead, we're going up here really rapidly.
[02:20:05.980 --> 02:20:08.620]   And we're causing a change in temperature
[02:20:08.620 --> 02:20:11.940]   compared to the long-term cycle,
[02:20:11.940 --> 02:20:14.580]   100,000 times faster.
[02:20:14.580 --> 02:20:15.860]   So-- - Yeah, I mean,
[02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:20.860]   my biggest worry is even subtle changes in climate
[02:20:22.260 --> 02:20:26.260]   might result in geopolitical pressures
[02:20:26.260 --> 02:20:28.780]   that then lead to nuclear war.
[02:20:28.780 --> 02:20:31.100]   - And that's, yeah, I mean, there's an argument
[02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:33.420]   that's actually behind, to some extent,
[02:20:33.420 --> 02:20:35.140]   not the Ukraine war so much,
[02:20:35.140 --> 02:20:38.300]   but the Arab Spring, the wars in Syria,
[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:41.300]   which partially has led to what's happening in Ukraine.
[02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:42.740]   So-- - And our weapons
[02:20:42.740 --> 02:20:44.220]   are getting more and more powerful
[02:20:44.220 --> 02:20:45.380]   and more and more destructive,
[02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:48.900]   more and more nations are having these destructive weapons,
[02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:52.620]   and now we're entering cyberspace
[02:20:52.620 --> 02:20:54.500]   where it's even easier to be destructive--
[02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:55.660]   - And hyperbaric weapons,
[02:20:55.660 --> 02:20:57.980]   which didn't exist in the Second World War.
[02:20:57.980 --> 02:21:00.380]   So, you know, you don't need nuclear weapons
[02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:02.940]   to have catastrophic attacks on each other.
[02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:04.700]   So, yeah, it's incredibly scary
[02:21:04.700 --> 02:21:08.420]   that the war-like side of human nature
[02:21:08.420 --> 02:21:13.420]   could be extremely enhanced by climate breakdown.
[02:21:13.420 --> 02:21:17.740]   - So, in this world, on a happy note,
[02:21:17.740 --> 02:21:18.660]   (laughing)
[02:21:18.660 --> 02:21:21.860]   I don't know how we went from Marxism and Stalinism
[02:21:21.860 --> 02:21:25.700]   to ecology, but all those are beautiful, complex systems.
[02:21:25.700 --> 02:21:31.540]   What is the best form of government, would you say?
[02:21:31.540 --> 02:21:33.820]   We talked about the economics of things.
[02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:40.340]   You ran for office, so you care about politics, too.
[02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:43.700]   How can politics, what political systems can help us here?
[02:21:43.700 --> 02:21:45.740]   - I think we first of all have to appreciate
[02:21:45.740 --> 02:21:49.740]   we're one species on our planet out of millions,
[02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:52.660]   and as the intelligent species,
[02:21:52.660 --> 02:21:56.620]   we should be enabling a harmonious life
[02:21:56.620 --> 02:21:58.340]   for those other species as well.
[02:21:58.340 --> 02:21:59.540]   - Can we actually linger on that?
[02:21:59.540 --> 02:22:03.260]   What is, you mentioned that we need to acknowledge
[02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:05.140]   the value of life on Earth.
[02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:12.780]   You know, can we integrate the labor theory of value,
[02:22:14.420 --> 02:22:18.300]   can we integrate into that the value of life?
[02:22:18.300 --> 02:22:21.420]   So, there's human life, and there's life.
[02:22:21.420 --> 02:22:24.140]   - If you take that structure that I talked about
[02:22:24.140 --> 02:22:28.180]   of Marx's use-value-exchange-value dialectic,
[02:22:28.180 --> 02:22:30.900]   the foreground-background, that only exists,
[02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:32.460]   that only works because we're exploiting
[02:22:32.460 --> 02:22:34.820]   the free energy we find in the universe.
[02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:39.000]   There could be no production system without free energy,
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.980]   which is the first law of thermodynamics.
[02:22:41.980 --> 02:22:44.100]   - There is free lunch, after all,
[02:22:44.100 --> 02:22:46.700]   and it's grounded in the energy that's provided to us.
[02:22:46.700 --> 02:22:47.940]   - Well, yeah, that's the free lunch.
[02:22:47.940 --> 02:22:48.780]   That's what we're exploiting.
[02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:50.500]   - It's the only free lunch we get.
[02:22:50.500 --> 02:22:51.780]   - You know Ginzburg's summary
[02:22:51.780 --> 02:22:54.180]   of the laws of thermodynamics, don't you?
[02:22:54.180 --> 02:22:55.260]   Alan Ginzburg?
[02:22:55.260 --> 02:22:56.100]   - What's that?
[02:22:56.100 --> 02:22:58.900]   - He said the laws of thermodynamics are summarized,
[02:22:58.900 --> 02:23:01.700]   A, you can't win, okay?
[02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:03.900]   B, you can't break even.
[02:23:03.900 --> 02:23:04.720]   - Yep.
[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:06.020]   - C, you can't leave the game.
[02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:08.300]   - Nice, yeah.
[02:23:08.300 --> 02:23:09.140]   - Beautiful summary.
[02:23:09.140 --> 02:23:10.420]   - Beautiful summary.
[02:23:10.420 --> 02:23:12.380]   - But the fact that it exists in the first place
[02:23:12.380 --> 02:23:14.020]   is the free lunch, okay?
[02:23:14.020 --> 02:23:15.780]   So we're exploiting the free lunch,
[02:23:15.780 --> 02:23:17.220]   but to be able to do it,
[02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:19.340]   we can't put waste back into that system
[02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:21.620]   so much that it undermines the free lunch,
[02:23:21.620 --> 02:23:23.460]   and that's what we've been doing.
[02:23:23.460 --> 02:23:27.780]   And once you respect the fact that we have to,
[02:23:27.780 --> 02:23:31.100]   living on the biosphere, the planet we're actually on,
[02:23:31.100 --> 02:23:35.780]   we have to enable that biosphere to survive us
[02:23:35.780 --> 02:23:37.460]   because if it doesn't survive us,
[02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:40.100]   we won't survive it disappearing,
[02:23:40.100 --> 02:23:43.260]   and there's not that realization in humanity in general.
[02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:45.980]   - And when you say the value of life,
[02:23:45.980 --> 02:23:49.380]   all the different living organisms on Earth
[02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:50.740]   are part of that biosphere.
[02:23:50.740 --> 02:23:51.580]   - Yeah.
[02:23:51.580 --> 02:23:54.780]   - So in order to maintain the biosphere,
[02:23:54.780 --> 02:23:58.620]   we have to respect, like, pragmatically speaking,
[02:23:58.620 --> 02:24:01.540]   what that means is actually respecting all of life on Earth,
[02:24:01.540 --> 02:24:02.740]   even the mosquitoes?
[02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:05.220]   - I've got some, no.
[02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:06.900]   (laughing)
[02:24:06.900 --> 02:24:07.740]   - So I personally--
[02:24:07.740 --> 02:24:10.420]   - Parasites, I mean, we are a parasite.
[02:24:10.420 --> 02:24:12.340]   When you look at it, we're the mosquitoes
[02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:16.580]   of the large organizations.
[02:24:16.580 --> 02:24:18.700]   You're a fan of the "Matrix" movies at all?
[02:24:18.700 --> 02:24:19.540]   - Sure.
[02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:20.380]   - Okay, you know the--
[02:24:20.380 --> 02:24:21.300]   - But look what I'm wearing.
[02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:23.740]   - Absolutely, I was wondering what the inspiration was.
[02:24:23.740 --> 02:24:24.580]   I was thinking--
[02:24:24.580 --> 02:24:25.500]   - It's not really inspiration.
[02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:27.260]   We are living in a simulation.
[02:24:27.260 --> 02:24:28.100]   - Okay.
[02:24:28.100 --> 02:24:29.780]   - And I have a conversation offline
[02:24:29.780 --> 02:24:31.180]   to have with you about that.
[02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:32.020]   - Okay, well--
[02:24:32.020 --> 02:24:32.840]   - You've been misbehaving,
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:34.180]   and we're gonna have to put you back in line.
[02:24:34.180 --> 02:24:38.180]   - So what's Agent Smith says when he's got Morpheus
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:39.380]   in his possession, he said,
[02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:41.820]   "I've been trying to classify your species,
[02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:43.780]   "I've decided you're a virus."
[02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:44.900]   (laughing)
[02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:46.200]   Now, there's truth to that.
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:48.780]   We have intruded into everything.
[02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:52.380]   We've taken over every element of the biosphere,
[02:24:52.380 --> 02:24:55.460]   and we think we can continue doing that.
[02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:57.020]   And the thing is, we're breaking that,
[02:24:57.020 --> 02:24:59.780]   we're exploiting it so much, we're breaking it down.
[02:24:59.780 --> 02:25:03.380]   And I think it's E.O. Wilson who argued for the 50% rule.
[02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:07.500]   He believed that we should reserve 50% of the planet
[02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:10.260]   for non-human species.
[02:25:10.260 --> 02:25:13.140]   In other words, we make 50% of it off limits.
[02:25:13.140 --> 02:25:15.060]   Humans cannot go there.
[02:25:15.060 --> 02:25:17.500]   And we just let that evolve as it does,
[02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:19.780]   and then we control the other 50%.
[02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:22.540]   I think he's probably giving too much to us.
[02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:26.220]   I think we should actually save like 20%, 25% max.
[02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:29.080]   And the rest of the planet, we let life go on
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:32.900]   and evolve as it does, without our interference,
[02:25:32.900 --> 02:25:34.420]   without our dominance.
[02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:38.460]   Now, that's neither a democratic system
[02:25:38.460 --> 02:25:40.140]   nor an authoritarian one.
[02:25:40.140 --> 02:25:42.100]   It's one which starts off with saying,
[02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:44.940]   the first thing humans have to do is respect life itself.
[02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:48.340]   Okay, so would we do that?
[02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:52.180]   We haven't done it, obviously.
[02:25:52.180 --> 02:25:53.580]   I don't think the Soviets would have done it
[02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:56.000]   if we had a generally Soviet system.
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.280]   We haven't done it under a capitalist.
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:25:59.780]   We continue intruding.
[02:25:59.780 --> 02:26:03.860]   So I think we have to go through something like a Star Trek.
[02:26:03.860 --> 02:26:06.980]   A Star Trek in a catastrophic 200 years
[02:26:06.980 --> 02:26:08.180]   to realize that ultimately,
[02:26:08.180 --> 02:26:09.760]   if we're gonna survive as a species,
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:11.980]   we have to respect life in general.
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:15.360]   And then that means parts of the planet,
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:16.800]   we can no longer touch.
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:20.020]   While we also try to maintain the planet
[02:26:20.020 --> 02:26:21.640]   at the temperature that we found it
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:23.940]   in what we now call the Anthropocene.
[02:26:23.940 --> 02:26:28.840]   Okay, so politically, we have to have,
[02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:33.720]   like in many ways, what native societies often have,
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:35.320]   a vision of the cycle of life,
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:38.780]   not this exponential progression we've developed
[02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:40.660]   over the last 250 years.
[02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:43.020]   And again, I'll use another movie,
[02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:46.140]   the Avatar type respect for the cycle of life.
[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:49.460]   We need to have that as part of our innate nature.
[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:54.060]   And then on top of that, the political system comes out.
[02:26:54.060 --> 02:26:56.320]   Now that political system has to be one
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:26:59.100]   that lets us feel like we have a say
[02:26:59.100 --> 02:27:02.360]   in the direction of society,
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:04.220]   while that part is sacrosanct.
[02:27:04.220 --> 02:27:05.920]   Okay, we can't touch it.
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:08.060]   But we also, because we are now living
[02:27:08.060 --> 02:27:11.300]   with so many challenges created by our own civilization.
[02:27:11.300 --> 02:27:13.500]   I mean, the main threat to the existence
[02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:15.980]   of human civilization is the existence
[02:27:15.980 --> 02:27:17.540]   of human civilization.
[02:27:17.540 --> 02:27:19.340]   - Is both a feature and a bug.
[02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:22.460]   - Yeah, and therefore, we need to have people
[02:27:22.460 --> 02:27:25.660]   who can understand complex systems making those decisions.
[02:27:25.660 --> 02:27:27.380]   Now that means it isn't a political system
[02:27:27.380 --> 02:27:29.940]   as much as it is an appreciation
[02:27:29.940 --> 02:27:32.100]   that the world is a complex system.
[02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:35.980]   And therefore, effects which we think are direct effects
[02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:38.300]   will actually come through in a bleak fashion.
[02:27:38.300 --> 02:27:42.440]   And we cannot, there's no simple linear progression
[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:44.940]   from where we are to where we wanna be.
[02:27:44.940 --> 02:27:46.820]   So you have to see how everything feeds together
[02:27:46.820 --> 02:27:47.820]   in a systemic way.
[02:27:47.820 --> 02:27:49.820]   And that's why, one reason I designed the software,
[02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:52.100]   I'm wearing the t-shirt for now, Minsky,
[02:27:52.100 --> 02:27:55.740]   is to have, it's nowhere near to this scale.
[02:27:55.740 --> 02:27:57.220]   I hope it one day will be.
[02:27:57.220 --> 02:27:58.860]   But something which means we can bring together
[02:27:58.860 --> 02:28:00.600]   all that complexity, all those systems,
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:03.060]   and perceive them on an enormous screen
[02:28:03.060 --> 02:28:04.660]   where we have all the various interacts
[02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:07.500]   and we can see what are potential futures.
[02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:10.500]   And that then guides us.
[02:28:10.500 --> 02:28:14.780]   So it isn't a case of democracy and outside wins a vote
[02:28:14.780 --> 02:28:18.020]   and therefore we ban abortion or we don't,
[02:28:18.020 --> 02:28:19.380]   whatever else happens.
[02:28:19.380 --> 02:28:23.060]   It's seeing what the, respecting the fact
[02:28:23.060 --> 02:28:24.740]   that we're in a complex system
[02:28:24.740 --> 02:28:27.540]   and being uncertain about the consequences
[02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:32.540]   and not making the bold, expansionary ideas
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:35.740]   that we've been doing.
[02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:37.680]   - So like being a little bit more,
[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:42.620]   humble.
[02:28:42.620 --> 02:28:44.500]   - Humble, humble is a good word.
[02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:48.660]   - But wouldn't you like to apply that same humility
[02:28:48.660 --> 02:28:53.660]   both to the considerations of the pros of capitalism
[02:28:53.660 --> 02:29:00.100]   and to the catastrophic view of the effects
[02:29:00.100 --> 02:29:00.940]   of climate change?
[02:29:00.940 --> 02:29:02.860]   - Yeah, and also like I think we can afford
[02:29:02.860 --> 02:29:04.120]   to be bold in space.
[02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:08.640]   And that's one reason I respect the practical vision
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:12.080]   of Musk and the so far impractical vision of Bezos.
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:15.700]   That if we're going, we look for the very far future,
[02:29:15.700 --> 02:29:18.260]   the only way we can continue expanding our knowledge
[02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:22.700]   of the universe is to move our civilization,
[02:29:22.700 --> 02:29:24.480]   the productive side of off the planet.
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:25.720]   - Off-site backup.
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:26.560]   - Yeah.
[02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:27.960]   - So can you actually linger on this?
[02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:29.840]   So let's actually talk about this.
[02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:32.300]   So first of all, you have the new book,
[02:29:32.300 --> 02:29:38.560]   humbly named The New Economics, A Manifesto.
[02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:40.040]   - The publisher chose the title.
[02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:41.980]   - Yes, no, but I'm joking,
[02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:46.920]   but maybe I will ask about why Manifesto,
[02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:48.400]   but we'll go through some of the ideas.
[02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:50.100]   In this book, we have been already.
[02:29:50.100 --> 02:29:55.520]   So some of it is embracing the fact that the economy,
[02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:58.920]   our world, our mind is a complex system.
[02:29:58.920 --> 02:30:00.920]   So this T-shirt that you're wearing.
[02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:02.400]   - Yep, take it out, yeah.
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:04.900]   - Is a piece of software.
[02:30:04.900 --> 02:30:07.280]   - I'll do that, if you like.
[02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:08.680]   - There you go, there you go.
[02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:13.160]   You're wearing the whole, what is this, an infomercial?
[02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:15.600]   So this is a T-shirt that says Minsky,
[02:30:15.600 --> 02:30:22.200]   after, not my Minsky, it's your Minsky.
[02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:25.320]   - Not Hyman, so no, the Hyman Minsky, not Marvin Minsky.
[02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:26.600]   - Not Marvin Minsky, right.
[02:30:26.600 --> 02:30:30.200]   So that's, so AI Minsky is Marvin,
[02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:33.640]   and then Harmon, it all rhymes.
[02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:38.640]   So stability is free open source system dynamics software
[02:30:38.640 --> 02:30:46.480]   invented by Mr. Steve Keen, coded by Russell Standish.
[02:30:46.480 --> 02:30:48.720]   It's on SourceForge.
[02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:52.160]   It's destabilizing.
[02:30:52.160 --> 02:30:53.720]   - Stability is destabilizing.
[02:30:53.760 --> 02:30:58.120]   - So that's sort of embracing the complex aspect of it.
[02:30:58.120 --> 02:30:58.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:30:58.960 --> 02:31:01.480]   - So how can you model the economy?
[02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:04.720]   What are some of the interesting,
[02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:06.840]   whether detailed or high level,
[02:31:06.840 --> 02:31:10.640]   big picture ideas behind your efforts of Minsky?
[02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:12.680]   - Okay, Minsky--
[02:31:12.680 --> 02:31:14.680]   - Meaning the software, the modeling software
[02:31:14.680 --> 02:31:17.360]   that models the dynamic system that is the economy.
[02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:19.880]   - What Minsky is doing is system dynamics modeling.
[02:31:19.880 --> 02:31:23.400]   So it's, if anybody's used Stellar or Vensim
[02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:27.000]   or Simulink, then they've used exactly the same family
[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:28.440]   of software that Minsky is part of.
[02:31:28.440 --> 02:31:29.400]   So I didn't invent that.
[02:31:29.400 --> 02:31:31.400]   That was invented by Jay Forrester,
[02:31:31.400 --> 02:31:33.080]   who's one of the great intellects,
[02:31:33.080 --> 02:31:36.200]   one of the great engineers in American history.
[02:31:36.200 --> 02:31:39.480]   And the idea of Forrester's system
[02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:42.360]   was complex interactions.
[02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:44.200]   So he was doing his work in the '50s.
[02:31:44.200 --> 02:31:48.120]   If people don't know Forrester's work,
[02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:50.040]   he actually built the models of the,
[02:31:51.320 --> 02:31:54.400]   the mathematics for the gun turrets on American warships
[02:31:54.400 --> 02:31:57.480]   in the Second World War, mechanical systems, obviously.
[02:31:57.480 --> 02:32:01.040]   So he had to work out how to give a feedback system
[02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:03.320]   that meant when the boat rolled in one direction,
[02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:05.320]   the turret did not roll the other way.
[02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:06.880]   All that stuff was his work.
[02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:08.440]   So marvelous engineering.
[02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:10.640]   And then he realized if you want to look at a,
[02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:13.760]   even like a factory, a factory is a complex system.
[02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:16.120]   And so you get cycles generated out of the interaction
[02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:18.920]   between different components of the factory
[02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:20.720]   that he was first involved in taming,
[02:32:20.720 --> 02:32:22.200]   so he built the software to model
[02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:23.880]   complex interactive systems.
[02:32:23.880 --> 02:32:24.840]   So Minsky is that.
[02:32:24.840 --> 02:32:26.440]   The thing that Minsky adds which is unique
[02:32:26.440 --> 02:32:27.840]   is the Godley table.
[02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:29.440]   And that's the double entry bookkeeping,
[02:32:29.440 --> 02:32:31.160]   so you can model the financial system.
[02:32:31.160 --> 02:32:32.320]   - Godley the economist.
[02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:35.680]   - Godley the economist, Wynne Godley, another great man.
[02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:37.360]   - So there's like this,
[02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:40.360]   so you're modeling it as like a state diagram.
[02:32:40.360 --> 02:32:41.200]   - Yeah, fundamentally.
[02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:43.520]   So it's actually, it's circuit diagrams.
[02:32:43.520 --> 02:32:47.000]   It's exactly what engineers have been using for decades,
[02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.760]   almost a century.
[02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:52.160]   So you're using a circuit diagram to model the economy.
[02:32:52.160 --> 02:32:55.840]   And that's the, so other factories have done it.
[02:32:55.840 --> 02:32:58.880]   What they haven't had in the circuit diagram
[02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:02.800]   is a way of handling the dynamics of the financial system.
[02:33:02.800 --> 02:33:05.000]   So what the Godley table does is bring it,
[02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.360]   financial flows as being,
[02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:11.320]   everything goes from somewhere and ends up somewhere.
[02:33:11.320 --> 02:33:13.120]   So you have a positive and a negative
[02:33:13.120 --> 02:33:15.400]   if you're looking on the liability side,
[02:33:16.440 --> 02:33:18.880]   a positive and a positive or negative and a negative
[02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:21.000]   if you're looking at assets and liabilities side.
[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.880]   And Minsky gets the accounting right for that.
[02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:25.400]   So you can do an enormous complex model,
[02:33:25.400 --> 02:33:27.280]   looking at the economy financially
[02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:29.360]   from the point of view of a dozen different actors
[02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:32.480]   in the economy and know that the mathematics is right,
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:33.520]   even though what you're building
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:35.080]   is set of differential equations,
[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:37.440]   which might be 50 differential equations
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:39.960]   with 350 terms in them.
[02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:41.280]   If you've got the Godley tables right,
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:43.480]   you know the mathematics is correct.
[02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:45.600]   So that's the main innovation that Minsky adds.
[02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:48.760]   - And you're operating there at the macroeconomics level.
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:50.480]   - Yeah, it's definitely macro, it's top down.
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:52.640]   It's not agent based.
[02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:54.560]   - And then this, I'm just opening on a random page
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:57.280]   that I think is very relevant here.
[02:33:57.280 --> 02:33:59.160]   The process, this is referring to Minsky,
[02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:01.880]   not the software, maybe the software, I don't know.
[02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:03.200]   The process can be captured
[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:05.520]   in an extremely simple causal chain.
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:08.160]   Capital determines output, output determines employment,
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:09.400]   the rate of employment determines
[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:11.040]   the rate of change of wages,
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:14.320]   output minus wages and interest payments determines profit,
[02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:16.000]   the profit rate determines the,
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:17.880]   there's a very nice circuit here.
[02:34:17.880 --> 02:34:21.160]   The profit rate determines the level of investment,
[02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:23.080]   which is the change in capital,
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:25.840]   which takes us back to the beginning of this causal chain,
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:29.400]   and the difference between investment and profits
[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:32.480]   determines the change in private debt.
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:36.080]   And there's some nice, the Keene-Minsky model
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:40.400]   and the intermittent route to chaos on page 86 of your book.
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:42.560]   These are, do these come from the software?
[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:45.840]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, I first did that in Mathematica
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:48.880]   back in 1992, August 1992.
[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:52.000]   - Mathematica's another amazing piece of software.
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:52.960]   - Yeah, and I find it,
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:55.160]   it's very much a programmer's approach to mathematics.
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:57.800]   I prefer like a program called MathCAD,
[02:34:57.800 --> 02:34:59.920]   which is what I'll be using for all my,
[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:03.200]   when I do my mathematics on the computer,
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:05.280]   I write in MathCAD. - CAD, C-A-D or CAB?
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:06.640]   - C-A-D. - Okay.
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:09.320]   - It's been ruined by bad management.
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:10.920]   They chucked out all the good engineers
[02:35:10.920 --> 02:35:13.880]   and I'm still using a version which is 12 years old.
[02:35:13.880 --> 02:35:16.480]   - If only engineers ruled the world.
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:18.680]   - If only engineers, rather than this particular case,
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:22.280]   there was a bunch of marketers for CAD software, agreed.
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:23.920]   I'm definitely a fan of engineers.
[02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:25.840]   - What are the plots that we're looking at here?
[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:30.040]   Growth rate, private debt ratio, employment versus wages,
[02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:32.120]   employment versus debt, income distribution.
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:36.120]   So this is across years, like different trade-offs.
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:38.320]   Is there something interesting to say about the plots
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:39.920]   and the insights from those plots that are generated?
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:41.680]   - Yeah, yeah. - By the software?
[02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:46.080]   - That's a particular parameter values to give that outcome.
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:49.120]   But what happened when I first simulated the model,
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:51.280]   I took a model by a guy called Richard Goodwin,
[02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:53.600]   who's one of the great neglected economists,
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:56.760]   American Marxist, mathematical Marxist.
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:35:59.360]   And what he did was build a model of cycles.
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:01.780]   And he actually wrote a paper called,
[02:36:01.780 --> 02:36:05.240]   it's only about a five-page paper,
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:07.520]   published in a book and a very,
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:09.600]   very obscure conference paper.
[02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:13.080]   And what he was doing was trying to build a model of Marx.
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:16.640]   Okay, so if you, he wrote it in 1967,
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:18.880]   and it was putting it in a mathematical form,
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:21.640]   a model that Marx came up with in 1867.
[02:36:21.640 --> 02:36:24.240]   So it was a centenary birthday present to Marx.
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:29.240]   And what Marx had argued in chapter 25, I think,
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:33.140]   of volume one of "Capital," section three,
[02:36:33.140 --> 02:36:39.080]   he built a verbal model of a cyclical system.
[02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:41.520]   And it's quite out of character with the rest of the book.
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:43.560]   So when you read volume one of "Capital,"
[02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:46.920]   people think Marx has got a commodity money,
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:48.760]   view of money, he doesn't at all.
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:51.720]   He simply did, the idea was he had like an onion.
[02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:52.840]   You start off on the middle level
[02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:54.440]   and you ignore the outer layer,
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:56.440]   then you bring the outer layer in and so on and so forth.
[02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:59.240]   Anyway, in this model, in volume one of "Capital,"
[02:36:59.240 --> 02:37:02.080]   he normally just assumed workers got a subsistence wage.
[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:02.960]   That's it.
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:06.920]   But in this little chapter, he said that if the economy,
[02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:09.560]   if the economy is, effectively, he said,
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:13.160]   economy is booming, then workers will demand wage rises.
[02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:16.760]   And the wage rises will cut into the profit
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:19.080]   so that capitalists will not get the level of profit
[02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:20.280]   they're expecting.
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:23.680]   Therefore, they will invest less and the economy will slump.
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:26.880]   And the slump will mean workers become unemployed
[02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:28.840]   and have to accept wage cuts.
[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:31.000]   And it was a model of a cyclical economy.
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.560]   And as it happens, Marx spent his later years
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:35.440]   trying to learn enough calculus
[02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:37.680]   to be able to model it himself mathematically.
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:38.680]   And he never managed.
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:40.840]   There's Marx's "Mathematical Notes on Calculus,"
[02:37:40.840 --> 02:37:42.120]   which are quite fun to read.
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:43.920]   And if you have a mathematical background--
[02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:45.240]   - Did he get far?
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:48.720]   - No, he got too caught up in the whole philosophy.
[02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:50.440]   He never really got to build the model.
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:54.600]   But what Goodwin realized was a predator-prey model.
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:57.840]   Okay, the Locter-Volterra model was the basis of the idea.
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:00.240]   So what the idea is, you have a prey,
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:05.080]   and the example that Locter actually used initially
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:07.160]   was grass.
[02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:08.560]   Grass is the prey.
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:12.040]   And then you have a predator, and the predator were cows.
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:15.400]   So you start off with a very few cows and lots of grass.
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:19.120]   And then because of lots of grass, the numbers of cows grow.
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:20.440]   And then because the cows grow,
[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:21.680]   they start to eat the grass.
[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:24.040]   So the grass runs out, so the cows starve,
[02:38:24.040 --> 02:38:25.280]   and you get a cycle.
[02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:26.680]   And what Locter was amazed by
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:28.760]   was that the cycles were persistent.
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:29.920]   They didn't die out.
[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:31.320]   So Goodwin got that vision,
[02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:33.800]   and he then built a predator-prey model.
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:35.520]   And I, first of all, read Goodwin
[02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:38.280]   and really found it really hard to follow his writing.
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:39.960]   He's not a very good writer.
[02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:41.400]   But a guy called John Blatt,
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:42.960]   who was a professor of mathematics
[02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:44.840]   at New South Wales University,
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:47.920]   wrote a brilliant explanation of Goodwin's model
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:49.880]   in a book called "Dynamic Economic Systems."
[02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:51.800]   And I read that, it was superb.
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:53.320]   And he said a way he could extend this
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:54.760]   was to include finance.
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:57.280]   So I thought, okay, what I'm gonna have
[02:38:57.280 --> 02:38:59.880]   is what Goodwin presumed
[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:02.600]   is capitalists invest all their profits.
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:07.120]   So you get a boom when there's a high rate of profit
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:08.520]   because they invest all that money,
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:10.760]   and then a slump when there's low profit
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:13.080]   because depreciation will wipe away capital
[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:14.720]   and you'll go boom and slump.
[02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:15.880]   So I simply added in, well,
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:19.520]   capitalists will invest more than their profits
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:21.000]   during a boom,
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.680]   but less than their profits during a slump.
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:25.320]   And that therefore means they had to borrow money
[02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:28.200]   to finance the gap and pay interest on the debt.
[02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:30.480]   So I ended up with a model with just three system states,
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:33.560]   the income share, the wages distribution of income
[02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:36.280]   between workers, capitalists, and bankers,
[02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:39.440]   the level of employment, and the level of private debt.
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:43.320]   And those three equations are fundamentally
[02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:45.680]   like going from the Locke de Volterra model
[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:47.040]   with just two equations,
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:49.240]   and therefore you get a fixed cycle,
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:51.800]   to the Lorenz model where you have three.
[02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:54.200]   And therefore what I got out of it was a chaotic outcome.
[02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:57.960]   So what you're seeing is a manifestation of chaos,
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:00.480]   complexity in those plots.
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:01.680]   But the fascinating,
[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:04.960]   one of the many fascinating parts about it was that
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:07.200]   as the level of private debt rose,
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:09.880]   in my model I had capitalists
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:11.920]   being the only ones who borrowed,
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:14.160]   but the people who paid for the high level of private debt
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:15.120]   were the workers.
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:20.960]   The rising banker's share corresponded exactly
[02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:23.200]   to a falling worker's share.
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:25.000]   - So you can infer from that
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:26.400]   that the workers are the ones paying.
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:28.000]   - Effectively, the workers end up paying for it.
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.160]   They get a lower level of wages.
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:33.840]   And the basic dynamic is that capitalists,
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:36.040]   when you have a three social class system,
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:38.760]   your income goes between workers, capitalists, and bankers.
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:40.040]   Now in the system, the good one did,
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:41.800]   they're just workers and capitalists.
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:45.320]   So if workers' share rose, profit capital share had to fall.
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:47.320]   But when you have three social classes,
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:49.120]   then capitalists' share can remain constant
[02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:50.680]   while workers fall and bankers,
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:53.520]   workers falls and bankers rise.
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:55.480]   So that's what actually happened.
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:57.880]   Because capitalists, the simple way I modeled it was,
[02:40:57.880 --> 02:40:59.520]   there's a certain rate of profit
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:02.000]   at which capitalists invest all their profits.
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:03.560]   Above that, they borrow more.
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:05.520]   Below that, they pay off debt.
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:08.600]   So what would happen is when you got back to that point,
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:10.280]   then the level of investment would be
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:13.160]   a precise share of GDP.
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:15.920]   And therefore, you get a precise rate of economic growth.
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:19.440]   But if there was a higher percentage going to bankers,
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:21.320]   an offset by a lower share going to workers,
[02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:23.120]   it didn't affect the capitalists.
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:25.880]   What you get is the cycles sort of diminish for a while
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:28.120]   because there's,
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:32.600]   so the income distribution effect is important.
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:37.040]   So the workers pay for the increasing level of debt.
[02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:38.240]   But the other side of it was
[02:41:38.240 --> 02:41:40.480]   that the cycles would diminish for a while.
[02:41:40.480 --> 02:41:43.400]   Now, what you get is a period of diminishing cycles,
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:45.480]   then leading to rising cycles.
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:47.920]   And technically, this is known as the
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:52.120]   Pomer Manifold route to chaos.
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:55.760]   And it's one particular element of Lorenz's equations
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:41:57.440]   of fluid dynamics.
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:01.360]   So what they found was in examining laminar flow
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:04.040]   in a fluid, you have a period where the laminar flow
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:06.640]   got more laminar, and then suddenly it'll start
[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:09.600]   to get less laminar and go turbulent.
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:12.400]   And this is what actually goes on in the model.
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:14.360]   So in my model of Minsky,
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:18.280]   so what you have is a period where there's big booms
[02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:21.120]   in cycles, and then as the debt level rises,
[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:23.440]   the booms and slums get smaller.
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:25.920]   And that looks like what neoclassical economists
[02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:27.920]   call the Great Moderation.
[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:30.840]   So when I first modeled this in 1982,
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:33.400]   I finished up my paper, which was published in '95,
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:35.840]   with what I thought was a nice rhetorical flourish,
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:39.000]   saying the chaotic dynamics of this paper
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:40.880]   should warn us against regarding a period
[02:42:40.880 --> 02:42:43.440]   of relative stability in a capitalist economy
[02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:46.240]   as anything more than a lull before the storm.
[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:47.760]   Now, I thought it was a great speed of rhetoric.
[02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:50.040]   I didn't think it was gonna fucking happen.
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:51.800]   But it did, because you had this period
[02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:55.060]   from 1990 through to 2007,
[02:42:55.060 --> 02:42:56.600]   where there were diminishing cycles.
[02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:59.660]   And the neoclassicals labeled that the Great Moderation,
[02:42:59.660 --> 02:43:00.880]   and they took the credit for it.
[02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:03.020]   They thought that the economy was being managed by them
[02:43:03.020 --> 02:43:06.080]   to a lower rate of inflation,
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:09.800]   a lower level of unemployment, less instability over time,
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:11.760]   and they literally took credit for it.
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:12.920]   And I was watching that and thinking,
[02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:16.100]   that's like my model running, and I'm scared as shit
[02:43:16.100 --> 02:43:17.920]   that there'll be a breakdown.
[02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:20.880]   And I ended up not working in the area for a while
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:23.200]   because I wrote "Debunking Economics."
[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:25.920]   And I got involved in a fight over the modeling
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:28.680]   of competition in neoclassical theory.
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:31.200]   That took me away for about four or five years.
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:35.600]   And then I got asked to do a court case in 2005,
[02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:37.800]   end of 2005.
[02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:41.320]   And I used Minsky as my framework for arguing
[02:43:41.320 --> 02:43:44.440]   that somebody who was involved in predatory lending
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:47.400]   should be able to get out of the debt they were in.
[02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:49.240]   And I explained Minsky's theory,
[02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:52.280]   and I used this throwaway line of saying,
[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:55.800]   debt levels, private debt, have been rising exponentially.
[02:43:55.800 --> 02:43:58.240]   And then I thought, well, I can't, as an expert,
[02:43:58.240 --> 02:43:59.400]   just make a claim like that.
[02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:01.280]   I've got to check the data.
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:03.760]   And the debt ratio was rising exponentially.
[02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:06.960]   And I thought, holy shit, we're in for a financial crisis.
[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:08.360]   And somebody has to warn about it.
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:10.800]   And at least in Australia, I was that somebody.
[02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:14.920]   - So can you, given this chaotic dynamics idea,
[02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:16.280]   can you talk about the crises
[02:44:16.280 --> 02:44:17.760]   ahead of us in the future?
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:19.120]   So one of the things,
[02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:21.720]   I mean, it's a fundamental question of economics,
[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:24.080]   is economics about understanding the past
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:26.080]   or predicting the future?
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:31.080]   Because you can construct models that do poetic,
[02:44:31.080 --> 02:44:35.680]   like in '95, poetic--
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:36.520]   - Inclusion.
[02:44:36.520 --> 02:44:40.560]   - Yeah, and then you can watch years fly by,
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:43.520]   and some of the predictions in retrospect
[02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:46.240]   that you make turn out to be true.
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:49.920]   But all kinds of gurus throughout history
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:52.120]   have done that kind of thing.
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:53.360]   You can call yourself right
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:56.160]   and forget all the many times you've been wrong.
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:44:57.760]   Let's talk about the future.
[02:44:57.760 --> 02:44:59.360]   What kind of stuff?
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:02.080]   You mentioned about the importance of the biosphere,
[02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:04.600]   but what other crises are ahead of us
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:09.600]   that a chaotic dynamics view allows us to predict
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:11.360]   and be concerned about? - Well, what really
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:14.800]   I saw coming out of it, leaving aside the ecological,
[02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:15.840]   wasn't a crisis.
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:17.640]   It was stagnation,
[02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:20.080]   because what we got out of the crisis
[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:22.320]   was caused by a rising level of private debt.
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:25.120]   Now you reach a peak level
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:28.640]   where the willingness to take on debt collapses.
[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:32.840]   And so you go to a period where debt is rising all the time.
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:36.160]   So credit, which is the annual change in debt,
[02:45:36.160 --> 02:45:38.400]   and that's credit as part of aggregate demand
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:39.880]   and aggregate income.
[02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:42.280]   So credit goes from positive to negative,
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:43.640]   and that causes a slump.
[02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:46.960]   - So can you describe why that causes a slump?
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:49.360]   So credit goes to negative.
[02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:50.640]   - If you ask Paul Krugman,
[02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:53.440]   he'll tell you credit plays no role in aggregate demand.
[02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:55.560]   - Give me a second.
[02:45:55.560 --> 02:45:58.680]   Credit plays no role in aggregate demand.
[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:00.920]   - So the vision that the neoclassicals have
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:03.880]   for the banking system is what they call learnable funds.
[02:46:03.880 --> 02:46:05.440]   - Is Paul Krugman, by the way,
[02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:09.440]   the knight at the front of the army
[02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:11.640]   that is the neoclassical economist?
[02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:12.960]   - Yeah, fundamentally.
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:13.800]   - Sure.
[02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:14.640]   - Okay.
[02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:17.080]   He's politically reasonable,
[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:20.280]   which makes him more dangerous than those that aren't.
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:22.360]   - He's politically,
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:23.560]   yeah, there's quite a lot of people
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:25.480]   that would disagree with that characterization
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:28.240]   of Paul Krugman as he's politically reasonable.
[02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:29.240]   - You should see the people behind him.
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:30.080]   - The alternatives.
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:31.520]   (laughing)
[02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:32.360]   Fair enough.
[02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:33.200]   - Okay.
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:34.640]   - That's not a negative or positive statement,
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:36.560]   that's just he can be feisty as well.
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:37.720]   - Oh, he can, he can.
[02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:40.760]   But he's like the human face of neoclassical economics.
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:42.960]   He doesn't deserve having a human face.
[02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:45.160]   It's anti-human theory.
[02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:46.000]   But he's the human face.
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:46.840]   - That's what you really think.
[02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:47.680]   I got you.
[02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:48.520]   All right, well, so,
[02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:52.360]   but the credit does not have any effect
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:54.240]   on aggregate demand.
[02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:55.080]   - In their model.
[02:46:55.080 --> 02:46:56.920]   - And you're saying that's not the case at all.
[02:46:56.920 --> 02:46:58.960]   - It's absolutely crucial to aggregate demand.
[02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:00.600]   So what they model is, again,
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:03.360]   the example of you lending to me or vice versa.
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:06.240]   If I lend money to you, I can spend less,
[02:47:06.240 --> 02:47:07.560]   you can spend more, okay?
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:10.920]   So credit is the change in debt.
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:13.600]   So if I lend money to you,
[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:17.040]   then there's a level of private debt rises, okay?
[02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:18.920]   So there's an increase in credit.
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:20.320]   But that increase in credit
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:22.720]   comes at an expense of my spending power.
[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:24.680]   So you can spend what I've lent you,
[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:26.760]   but I can't spend what I've lent you.
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:28.560]   So credit cancels out.
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:30.520]   But when you look at, that's learnable funds.
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:31.720]   But in the real world,
[02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:33.720]   and the Bank of England has said this is the real world
[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:37.840]   and the textbooks are wrong, categorically in 2014.
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:42.040]   When the bank lends, it adds to its asset side
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:43.800]   and it says, "You owe us more money."
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:45.880]   And it adds to its liability side and says,
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:47.600]   "Here's the money in your bank account."
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:49.320]   Now you spend that money.
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:51.240]   So what happens when you do your sums,
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:55.200]   credit is part of aggregate demand and aggregate income.
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:58.760]   And that's something I first solved in 2019, I think.
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:02.040]   2000, I only recently proved it mathematically.
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:03.840]   So what that means is credit
[02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:07.320]   is a component of aggregate demand
[02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:09.480]   and credit is also very volatile.
[02:48:09.480 --> 02:48:11.840]   So like consumption demand never goes negative.
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:13.720]   Investment demand never goes negative.
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:15.960]   But credit can go from positive to negative.
[02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:19.480]   And when you take a look at the long run of American history
[02:48:19.480 --> 02:48:21.520]   after the Second World War,
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:26.520]   there was no period until 2007 where credit was negative.
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:30.760]   It was a positive component of GDP, a positive number.
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:33.760]   Therefore, when you do it as a percentage of GDP,
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:36.240]   it was a positive percentage of GDP.
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:41.240]   It peaked at 16% of GDP in 2006, 2007.
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:47.400]   It fell to minus 5% in 2008, 2009.
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:51.880]   So you had a 20% of GDP turnaround in aggregate demand.
[02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:54.840]   Now, when you plot that against unemployment,
[02:48:54.840 --> 02:48:59.840]   the correlation of credit to unemployment
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:05.120]   across the period from about 1990 to 2010
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:08.800]   is about minus 0.9, okay?
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:10.480]   Enormous negative correlation.
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:11.920]   Now, according to the neoclassicals,
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:13.800]   it could be close to zero.
[02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:16.120]   Empirically, it's bleedingly obvious it's not.
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:18.560]   And it applies to every country in the world
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:21.440]   that had a financial crisis at that period.
[02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:24.680]   So it's bleedingly obvious in the data
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:27.960]   and they ignore it because credit's not part of their model.
[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:29.680]   - And you're saying it's causation.
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:31.760]   - It's not just causation. - It's causal.
[02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:34.480]   - Today, we sit there, it's extremely high inflation.
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:39.160]   What does inflation,
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:41.440]   what role does inflation play in this picture?
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:43.440]   Is a little bit of inflation good?
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:48.080]   We talked about money creation at the beginning.
[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:50.560]   What's a little bit of inflation good or bad?
[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:52.160]   A lot of inflation good or bad?
[02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:53.640]   How concerned are you about--
[02:49:53.640 --> 02:49:55.960]   - A little bit is good for a simple reason.
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:49:57.240]   Like, again, it's taken me a while
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:49:58.680]   to get my head around this.
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:00.280]   But if you think about how people say,
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:01.480]   "What are the functions of money?"
[02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:02.960]   They say money, it's a unit of count,
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:04.640]   a count that you're measuring.
[02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:06.880]   It's a means of exchange, okay?
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:09.200]   And it's a store of value, okay?
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:12.360]   Now, yes, okay, it has those three roles,
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:16.040]   but the last one is contradictory to the previous two.
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:17.600]   Because, and this is where we see this
[02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:19.480]   with the Bitcoin phenomenon.
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:22.160]   If you wanna hang onto money as a store of value,
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:28.760]   then if prices are falling, the value of money is rising.
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:32.280]   And it's actually in your interests as a store of value
[02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:35.200]   to hang onto it and not spend it, okay?
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:39.200]   So that contradicts its role as a means of exchange.
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:41.600]   Now, if you have money which depreciates,
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:45.040]   and this was actually tried in the Austrian town of Wargill
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:48.200]   during the Great Depression.
[02:50:48.200 --> 02:50:50.320]   If you have money that depreciates,
[02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:53.200]   then if you don't use it, you lose it, fundamentally.
[02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:55.360]   So it has a high rate of circulation.
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:50:59.720]   So there's a monetary theorist called Silvio Gazzel,
[02:50:59.720 --> 02:51:03.480]   and he wrote this proposal that money should depreciate.
[02:51:03.480 --> 02:51:06.880]   And he was ridiculed and opposed and derided,
[02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:09.240]   but Keynes said he was a great intellect.
[02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:13.440]   And the mayor of the town of Wargill in Austria
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:16.560]   during the Great Depression was facing an unemployment rate
[02:51:16.560 --> 02:51:18.440]   of 25% pretty much.
[02:51:18.440 --> 02:51:20.320]   Germany had the worst experience
[02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:22.600]   in the Great Depression in the world,
[02:51:22.600 --> 02:51:25.480]   as bad as America, slightly worse than America.
[02:51:25.480 --> 02:51:28.520]   And so he thought, how can I stimulate demand here?
[02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:30.720]   So he produced a script which could only be used
[02:51:30.720 --> 02:51:33.160]   for buying goods and services in Wargill,
[02:51:33.160 --> 02:51:37.380]   and could be used to pay your local rates.
[02:51:37.380 --> 02:51:39.920]   But it was depreciated by putting a stamp on the money
[02:51:39.920 --> 02:51:41.400]   if you didn't use it.
[02:51:41.400 --> 02:51:44.240]   So what happened was people would pay their rates,
[02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:46.320]   they needed to pay the rates using this money,
[02:51:46.320 --> 02:51:48.860]   so the script, so they used the script.
[02:51:48.860 --> 02:51:52.660]   And because it depreciated, you'd use it rapidly.
[02:51:52.660 --> 02:51:54.580]   So people were using that money,
[02:51:54.580 --> 02:51:57.660]   this alternative to the Austrian shilling,
[02:51:57.660 --> 02:52:00.060]   and the economic activity in town took off,
[02:52:00.060 --> 02:52:01.980]   and unemployment fell to zero.
[02:52:01.980 --> 02:52:03.380]   And it was an absolute miracle,
[02:52:03.380 --> 02:52:05.380]   and everybody loved a Wargill experiment,
[02:52:05.380 --> 02:52:08.140]   and the Austrian Central Bank sued them
[02:52:08.140 --> 02:52:10.180]   for establishing an alternative form of money
[02:52:10.180 --> 02:52:11.700]   and shut it down.
[02:52:11.700 --> 02:52:14.180]   Unemployment went back up to 25% again,
[02:52:14.180 --> 02:52:16.540]   and Austria voted, you know, what, 99 point,
[02:52:16.540 --> 02:52:20.060]   was it 99.6% for the Nazis?
[02:52:20.060 --> 02:52:23.020]   Something crazy number like that when Hitler marched in.
[02:52:23.020 --> 02:52:25.140]   So the Wargill experiment showed
[02:52:25.140 --> 02:52:27.240]   that a depreciating currency
[02:52:27.240 --> 02:52:29.660]   led to a high rate of circulation.
[02:52:29.660 --> 02:52:30.820]   But of course, we're not talking
[02:52:30.820 --> 02:52:33.600]   Weimar Republic levels of inflation.
[02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:35.940]   So when you get that much inflation,
[02:52:35.940 --> 02:52:37.860]   and that's normally caused by,
[02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:41.520]   as the Weimar inflation was caused by,
[02:52:41.520 --> 02:52:44.500]   the reparation terms imposed on Germany,
[02:52:44.500 --> 02:52:47.780]   fundamentally by France, at the Treaty of Versailles,
[02:52:47.780 --> 02:52:50.020]   they paid a large part of that
[02:52:50.020 --> 02:52:52.060]   with just basically printing the notes.
[02:52:52.060 --> 02:52:54.820]   And you went into this crazy period of hyperinflation.
[02:52:54.820 --> 02:52:56.740]   So hyperinflation almost always occurs
[02:52:56.740 --> 02:52:59.580]   when there's a massive destruction of physical resources,
[02:52:59.580 --> 02:53:01.540]   and the monetary authority tries to pay back,
[02:53:01.540 --> 02:53:03.940]   literally, over it, and then you get hyperinflation,
[02:53:03.940 --> 02:53:05.660]   that's total social breakdown.
[02:53:05.660 --> 02:53:07.740]   So a moderate level of inflation
[02:53:07.740 --> 02:53:12.480]   inspires the means of exchange uses of money,
[02:53:12.480 --> 02:53:16.320]   but undermines the store of value usage of money.
[02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:19.820]   And that dilemma is why we have
[02:53:19.820 --> 02:53:23.400]   this antagonistic attitude towards inflation.
[02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:26.720]   - Yeah, I mean, you're describing as a tension,
[02:53:26.720 --> 02:53:30.140]   but it's nevertheless is,
[02:53:30.140 --> 02:53:32.720]   like money is a store of value and a means of exchange.
[02:53:32.720 --> 02:53:35.660]   And I don't, you know, to push back,
[02:53:35.660 --> 02:53:37.720]   it's not necessarily that there's a tension,
[02:53:37.720 --> 02:53:40.040]   it's just that depending on the dynamics
[02:53:40.040 --> 02:53:43.520]   of this beautiful economic system of ours,
[02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:45.760]   it's used as one more than the other.
[02:53:45.760 --> 02:53:49.440]   If there's inflation, you're using it more
[02:53:49.440 --> 02:53:52.680]   for the means of exchange,
[02:53:52.680 --> 02:53:54.900]   it's deflation using more for store of value,
[02:53:54.900 --> 02:53:57.120]   but that doesn't, I don't see there's a tension,
[02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:01.040]   that's just how much you use it for those different, like.
[02:54:01.040 --> 02:54:03.520]   - But it ends up saying that overall,
[02:54:03.520 --> 02:54:06.380]   for a level of effective commerce,
[02:54:06.380 --> 02:54:08.320]   a bit of inflation is a good thing,
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:10.320]   because that's depreciating the money slightly
[02:54:10.320 --> 02:54:11.480]   and encourage its use.
[02:54:11.480 --> 02:54:13.280]   - Yeah, but so the argument that,
[02:54:13.280 --> 02:54:17.560]   so Bitcoin folks use or gold standard folks.
[02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:18.400]   - Yeah.
[02:54:18.400 --> 02:54:21.580]   - Again, HODL is not an argument.
[02:54:21.580 --> 02:54:27.240]   That having an inflation of zero
[02:54:27.240 --> 02:54:29.160]   is actually achieving that balance.
[02:54:29.160 --> 02:54:30.800]   - Yeah.
[02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:31.920]   - So like, yeah.
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:33.800]   - But they're actually in favor of negative,
[02:54:33.800 --> 02:54:35.880]   or they wanted to appreciate rapidly,
[02:54:35.880 --> 02:54:38.200]   and there's a particularly negative inflation.
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:42.840]   The value of the money rising relative to commodities,
[02:54:42.840 --> 02:54:45.340]   that's what they want, that's the HODL philosophy.
[02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:48.000]   - Well, that's more of like an investment,
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:49.120]   I don't know if that,
[02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:49.960]   - Yeah.
[02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:50.800]   - That's more of investment philosophy
[02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:52.160]   than the fundamental principles
[02:54:52.160 --> 02:54:54.680]   of why they believe in cryptocurrency,
[02:54:54.680 --> 02:54:58.080]   in the enforced scarcity, it's a model.
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:01.240]   The concern there is that when you print money,
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:04.540]   the public policy is detached from the actual,
[02:55:04.540 --> 02:55:07.380]   from value.
[02:55:07.380 --> 02:55:09.400]   - Yeah, well, you get, I mean, this is where, again,
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:11.700]   it matters to get money creation right,
[02:55:11.700 --> 02:55:14.400]   because the government's not the only money creator,
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:17.020]   banks are as well, private banks.
[02:55:17.020 --> 02:55:20.560]   And if we obsess too much
[02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:23.600]   about limiting government money creation,
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:26.400]   what we end up getting, if there is money creation going on,
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:28.040]   it's private banks doing it,
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:30.280]   and you get an increase in private debt,
[02:55:30.280 --> 02:55:33.320]   and fundamentally, private debt and its collapse,
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:37.900]   a collapse of credit, when it stops growing,
[02:55:37.900 --> 02:55:41.060]   that's the fundamental cause of financial crises.
[02:55:41.060 --> 02:55:41.900]   So,
[02:55:41.900 --> 02:55:42.940]   - Yeah, but the question is,
[02:55:42.940 --> 02:55:45.740]   what's the cause for the collapse of the,
[02:55:45.740 --> 02:55:49.420]   - Well, I think this is like the Austrian thinking
[02:55:49.420 --> 02:55:51.740]   leaves out the debt deflation,
[02:55:51.740 --> 02:55:54.300]   and that's like, I think one of the most important papers
[02:55:54.300 --> 02:55:56.460]   ever written was by Irving Fisher,
[02:55:56.460 --> 02:55:59.460]   called the Debt Deflation Theory of Great Depressions.
[02:55:59.460 --> 02:56:02.580]   Fisher was somebody who accepted the neoclassical vision,
[02:56:02.580 --> 02:56:07.500]   and he wrote the pre-efficiency market hypothesis,
[02:56:07.500 --> 02:56:09.260]   efficiency market hypothesis.
[02:56:09.260 --> 02:56:13.600]   He had his own PhD called the Theory of Interest.
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:16.100]   And in that he argued effectively
[02:56:16.100 --> 02:56:20.480]   for a supply and demand analysis of the financial system.
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:23.700]   And he argued for equilibrium.
[02:56:23.700 --> 02:56:27.340]   He said, when you're working with a commodity market,
[02:56:27.340 --> 02:56:32.340]   then the sale and the transaction and the exchange occur
[02:56:32.540 --> 02:56:34.000]   at the same point in time.
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.980]   When you're working with a financial market,
[02:56:36.980 --> 02:56:39.460]   then the exchange occurs through time.
[02:56:39.460 --> 02:56:43.220]   So he said he assumed that debts are repaid,
[02:56:43.220 --> 02:56:45.800]   all debts are repaid.
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:48.560]   And he assumed that equilibrium through time
[02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:50.180]   was an essential part of his assumption.
[02:56:50.180 --> 02:56:52.680]   This is, and then the Great Depression comes along,
[02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:59.420]   and he has become a major shareholder in the rank Xerox,
[02:56:59.420 --> 02:57:01.300]   because he invented the Rolodex.
[02:57:02.180 --> 02:57:03.500]   He's a tinkerer.
[02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:07.380]   And so he had taken out shares on margin,
[02:57:07.380 --> 02:57:10.940]   and he was worth about 100 million in modern terms
[02:57:10.940 --> 02:57:12.400]   when the Great Depression hit.
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:14.900]   And 90% of that was share market valuation.
[02:57:14.900 --> 02:57:18.060]   He'd taken out margin debt, just like everybody else.
[02:57:18.060 --> 02:57:20.900]   And with margin debt, you could put down $100,000
[02:57:20.900 --> 02:57:23.000]   and buy a million dollars worth of shares.
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:27.080]   So he got this huge leverage into debt.
[02:57:27.080 --> 02:57:28.940]   Now, when the financial crisis hit,
[02:57:28.940 --> 02:57:30.420]   the level of margin debt in America
[02:57:30.420 --> 02:57:34.460]   had risen from half a percent of GDP in 1920
[02:57:34.460 --> 02:57:38.580]   to 13% of GDP in 1929.
[02:57:38.580 --> 02:57:40.340]   It then fell to zero again.
[02:57:40.340 --> 02:57:42.100]   That's why the stock market crash in '29
[02:57:42.100 --> 02:57:46.380]   was so devastating, that scale of margin lending.
[02:57:46.380 --> 02:57:47.620]   And everybody was being wiped out.
[02:57:47.620 --> 02:57:49.940]   They were selling Rolls Royces for 20 quid.
[02:57:49.940 --> 02:57:52.180]   You literally have photographs showing people doing that,
[02:57:52.180 --> 02:57:53.980]   because a margin call comes in,
[02:57:53.980 --> 02:57:56.380]   you've got to liquidate everything.
[02:57:56.380 --> 02:58:00.020]   So he said the danger is of a debt deflation
[02:58:00.020 --> 02:58:02.060]   is what we have to avoid.
[02:58:02.060 --> 02:58:05.180]   And that means you don't want too much private debt
[02:58:05.180 --> 02:58:09.080]   to accumulate, and you don't want falling prices,
[02:58:09.080 --> 02:58:11.700]   because the falling prices will amplify
[02:58:11.700 --> 02:58:14.580]   the impact of being insolvent to begin with.
[02:58:14.580 --> 02:58:16.720]   And that's what we saw in the Great Depression.
[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:19.660]   It's partially what we saw in 2007,
[02:58:19.660 --> 02:58:23.100]   but we didn't have anything like the level of margin debt.
[02:58:23.100 --> 02:58:26.300]   Margin debt was reduced from 90% to 50% ratio
[02:58:26.300 --> 02:58:28.080]   after the Great Depression.
[02:58:29.020 --> 02:58:33.020]   So there were limits on how bad it was in 2007.
[02:58:33.020 --> 02:58:36.420]   But the danger is still the period of deflation
[02:58:36.420 --> 02:58:38.260]   amplifies your debts.
[02:58:38.260 --> 02:58:40.580]   Okay, and I call it Fisher's paradox.
[02:58:40.580 --> 02:58:42.180]   He didn't write those terms himself,
[02:58:42.180 --> 02:58:43.300]   but he wrote a line saying,
[02:58:43.300 --> 02:58:46.380]   "The more debtors pay, the more they owe."
[02:58:46.380 --> 02:58:49.460]   Okay, and this is because you're liquidating
[02:58:49.460 --> 02:58:52.300]   to try to meet your own debts.
[02:58:52.300 --> 02:58:55.000]   When you liquidate, the price level falls.
[02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:58.420]   You will end up having a lower level of monetary debt,
[02:58:58.420 --> 02:58:59.900]   but a higher level of debt
[02:58:59.900 --> 02:59:02.300]   when you deflate it using the price level.
[02:59:02.300 --> 02:59:05.780]   So the biggest danger in capitalism is the debt deflation,
[02:59:05.780 --> 02:59:07.940]   far more dangerous than inflation.
[02:59:07.940 --> 02:59:10.980]   - And the cause of debt deflation is?
[02:59:10.980 --> 02:59:13.060]   - Too much lending, too much bank lending,
[02:59:13.060 --> 02:59:15.140]   too much private money creation.
[02:59:15.140 --> 02:59:17.540]   And if you take a look at the 1920s,
[02:59:17.540 --> 02:59:21.140]   Calvin Coolidge explained the boom of the 1920s
[02:59:21.140 --> 02:59:22.020]   on his surplus.
[02:59:22.020 --> 02:59:25.540]   He said, "My government running a surplus of 1% of GDP,"
[02:59:25.540 --> 02:59:28.420]   pretty much from 1922 through to 1930,
[02:59:28.420 --> 02:59:30.500]   "is the foundation of our stability.
[02:59:30.500 --> 02:59:31.940]   "It should be continued."
[02:59:31.940 --> 02:59:35.740]   What he didn't look at was that over that same time period,
[02:59:35.740 --> 02:59:39.860]   on average, Americans were borrowing 5% of GDP per year
[02:59:39.860 --> 02:59:41.140]   from the private banks.
[02:59:41.140 --> 02:59:44.860]   So you had a housing bubble at the beginning of the 1920s,
[02:59:44.860 --> 02:59:46.600]   which Richard Vague covers beautifully
[02:59:46.600 --> 02:59:49.540]   in "A Brief History of Doom."
[02:59:49.540 --> 02:59:53.020]   And then you had this huge rise in margin debt as well,
[02:59:53.020 --> 02:59:55.540]   gigantic increase in margin debt.
[02:59:55.540 --> 02:59:58.580]   So all this borrowed money was being spent into the economy,
[02:59:58.580 --> 03:00:00.940]   and this is where credit becomes part of aggregate demand.
[03:00:00.940 --> 03:00:02.780]   And it's both not just for goods and services,
[03:00:02.780 --> 03:00:05.700]   it's also for shares and houses and so on.
[03:00:05.700 --> 03:00:07.900]   So a huge valuation effect.
[03:00:07.900 --> 03:00:11.460]   But then when the margin debt turned around,
[03:00:11.460 --> 03:00:14.200]   when people would not take out margin debt anymore,
[03:00:14.200 --> 03:00:16.080]   the demand for margin debt disappeared,
[03:00:16.080 --> 03:00:21.020]   and then it was what we call badly a positive feedback loop.
[03:00:21.020 --> 03:00:23.060]   It was actually an amplifying feedback loop.
[03:00:23.060 --> 03:00:25.060]   And that caused a collapse.
[03:00:25.060 --> 03:00:28.220]   - So what elements of that do you see today
[03:00:28.220 --> 03:00:30.220]   that we need to fix, and how do we fix it?
[03:00:30.220 --> 03:00:32.340]   - We have to regard the level of private debt
[03:00:32.340 --> 03:00:35.000]   as a target of economic policy,
[03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:36.660]   just as much as the rate of inflation
[03:00:36.660 --> 03:00:37.980]   or the rate of unemployment.
[03:00:37.980 --> 03:00:41.060]   - How do, what is the moderate amount of private debt
[03:00:41.060 --> 03:00:41.900]   that's good?
[03:00:41.900 --> 03:00:44.540]   - I would say something of anywhere between 30 and 70%
[03:00:44.540 --> 03:00:46.220]   of GDP.
[03:00:46.220 --> 03:00:47.660]   - What is it currently?
[03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:50.100]   - In America, it's 170%.
[03:00:50.100 --> 03:00:51.660]   - Nice.
[03:00:51.660 --> 03:00:52.500]   Of GDP.
[03:00:52.500 --> 03:00:53.320]   - Of GDP.
[03:00:53.320 --> 03:00:54.160]   - Oh, that's nice.
[03:00:54.160 --> 03:00:55.980]   - I've got, we'll have to talk about it after we talk,
[03:00:55.980 --> 03:00:57.660]   but I can show you the data in this.
[03:00:57.660 --> 03:01:02.260]   And it is just this huge increase in private debt
[03:01:02.260 --> 03:01:04.420]   that caused, first of all, caused the boom,
[03:01:04.420 --> 03:01:07.020]   but then financing the credit causes,
[03:01:07.020 --> 03:01:09.980]   ultimately causes the slump.
[03:01:09.980 --> 03:01:14.340]   And so if we remove the rate level at which debt can reach,
[03:01:14.340 --> 03:01:16.420]   and we stop speculative lending,
[03:01:16.420 --> 03:01:19.660]   and basically have a lending for both innovation,
[03:01:19.660 --> 03:01:23.340]   investment, and essential consumption items,
[03:01:23.340 --> 03:01:25.180]   we won't have the slump on the other side.
[03:01:25.180 --> 03:01:27.500]   We can get rid of financial instability.
[03:01:27.500 --> 03:01:29.780]   We can't stop financial cycles,
[03:01:29.780 --> 03:01:31.500]   but we can stop financial breakdown.
[03:01:31.500 --> 03:01:33.540]   - And so we should really be focusing on the instability
[03:01:33.540 --> 03:01:35.300]   and getting that under control.
[03:01:35.300 --> 03:01:37.660]   By the way, as you point to your laptop,
[03:01:37.660 --> 03:01:39.260]   my laptops, I have a lot of,
[03:01:39.260 --> 03:01:41.500]   how many computers do I have?
[03:01:41.500 --> 03:01:44.260]   But a lot of them, but my little Surface,
[03:01:44.260 --> 03:01:45.660]   whatever the heck this thing is,
[03:01:45.660 --> 03:01:47.740]   is getting definite size envy.
[03:01:47.740 --> 03:01:50.060]   Is your laptop, you said is 18 something inches?
[03:01:50.060 --> 03:01:51.140]   - 18.4 inches.
[03:01:51.140 --> 03:01:52.580]   - 18.4 inches.
[03:01:52.580 --> 03:01:56.780]   I don't think I've ever seen one that big,
[03:01:56.780 --> 03:01:59.540]   and I'll give the internet that one.
[03:01:59.540 --> 03:02:01.580]   All right, that's for the graphics.
[03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:03.260]   So it's a gaming laptop.
[03:02:03.260 --> 03:02:05.060]   It's basically a desktop.
[03:02:05.060 --> 03:02:07.180]   It probably weighs like 40 pounds.
[03:02:07.180 --> 03:02:08.540]   You have to--
[03:02:08.540 --> 03:02:10.060]   - Eight kilos?
[03:02:10.060 --> 03:02:10.900]   - Eight kilos.
[03:02:10.900 --> 03:02:12.140]   - So you reckon eight or?
[03:02:12.140 --> 03:02:13.780]   - Oh, wow, okay, yeah.
[03:02:13.780 --> 03:02:16.460]   Eight kilos, that's, you're pushing 40 pounds.
[03:02:16.460 --> 03:02:17.780]   - Is there a power supply for it?
[03:02:17.780 --> 03:02:18.620]   It's over there somewhere.
[03:02:18.620 --> 03:02:20.860]   The power supply weighs about twice as much as your laptop.
[03:02:20.860 --> 03:02:23.660]   - Yeah, and you have to power it on with a crank.
[03:02:23.660 --> 03:02:24.500]   - Pretty close.
[03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:25.420]   - You have to pull it.
[03:02:25.420 --> 03:02:27.300]   Is it gas powered or is it coal?
[03:02:27.300 --> 03:02:29.900]   - Oh, well, it's a nuclear power station inside.
[03:02:29.900 --> 03:02:30.740]   - Nuclear, yeah.
[03:02:30.740 --> 03:02:33.220]   - And a nuclear diamond in the back there.
[03:02:33.220 --> 03:02:37.020]   - Okay, so let me, before I forget,
[03:02:37.020 --> 03:02:38.980]   just let me ask you about,
[03:02:38.980 --> 03:02:43.660]   we've covered brilliantly the nuance disagreements you have
[03:02:43.660 --> 03:02:46.140]   and the wisdom you've drawn from Karl Marx,
[03:02:46.140 --> 03:02:50.420]   but there is also, like you mentioned in popular discourse,
[03:02:50.420 --> 03:02:55.420]   a kind of a distorted use of different terms,
[03:02:55.420 --> 03:02:57.860]   and one of them is Marxism today.
[03:02:57.860 --> 03:03:00.100]   Is there something you could just speak to
[03:03:00.100 --> 03:03:05.100]   about increased use of that word
[03:03:05.100 --> 03:03:07.180]   and is it misused?
[03:03:07.180 --> 03:03:08.980]   Does it concern you that there's a lot of actually
[03:03:08.980 --> 03:03:12.300]   young people that say they're sort of proudly Marxist?
[03:03:12.300 --> 03:03:15.500]   Are they misusing the term?
[03:03:15.500 --> 03:03:17.140]   - They are definitely misusing the term
[03:03:17.140 --> 03:03:20.980]   if they don't understand the use value, exchange value
[03:03:20.980 --> 03:03:22.660]   dialectic I went through earlier.
[03:03:22.660 --> 03:03:24.820]   - So if I could just--
[03:03:24.820 --> 03:03:25.700]   - And they don't.
[03:03:25.700 --> 03:03:29.580]   - If I could just pause, the idea of socialism
[03:03:29.580 --> 03:03:33.100]   and Marxism as used in sort of popular lingo
[03:03:33.100 --> 03:03:37.820]   is basically, a lot of people have
[03:03:37.820 --> 03:03:40.820]   a disproportionately hard life.
[03:03:40.820 --> 03:03:43.740]   Why can't we help them out?
[03:03:43.740 --> 03:03:46.500]   Why can't we be kind to our fellow man?
[03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:50.740]   That's a short embodiment of an idea
[03:03:50.740 --> 03:03:53.700]   as opposed to some super complicated,
[03:03:53.700 --> 03:03:57.580]   elaborate model of the economy and politics
[03:03:57.580 --> 03:03:58.420]   and all that kind of stuff.
[03:03:58.420 --> 03:04:00.940]   - I mean, we could do that by using the insights
[03:04:00.940 --> 03:04:02.740]   that come out of modern monetary theory,
[03:04:02.740 --> 03:04:06.060]   which I've confirmed just using my simple Minsky models,
[03:04:06.060 --> 03:04:08.180]   and that is that, to use the term,
[03:04:08.180 --> 03:04:10.140]   you use the feature, not a bug.
[03:04:10.140 --> 03:04:12.780]   A government running a deficit is a feature
[03:04:12.780 --> 03:04:17.100]   of a well-functioning mixed fiat credit economy, not a bug.
[03:04:17.100 --> 03:04:19.300]   The government should normally run a deficit
[03:04:19.300 --> 03:04:21.580]   because that's how the government creates money.
[03:04:21.580 --> 03:04:23.020]   Now, because we've had this obsession
[03:04:23.020 --> 03:04:26.100]   from mainstream economists of running a surplus,
[03:04:26.100 --> 03:04:28.540]   which is what caused the Great Depression,
[03:04:28.540 --> 03:04:30.700]   Calvin Coolidge doing it for eight years,
[03:04:30.700 --> 03:04:32.060]   because of that obsession,
[03:04:32.060 --> 03:04:33.660]   we've cut back on social services,
[03:04:33.660 --> 03:04:35.900]   we've cut back on health, we've cut back on education,
[03:04:35.900 --> 03:04:37.660]   we've cut back on infrastructure.
[03:04:37.660 --> 03:04:40.460]   Now, all that stuff predominantly affects the poor
[03:04:40.460 --> 03:04:42.540]   'cause the rich can afford to buy it themselves.
[03:04:42.540 --> 03:04:44.900]   So if we had, Sonnenberg realized
[03:04:44.900 --> 03:04:46.580]   that the government should run a deficit,
[03:04:46.580 --> 03:04:50.420]   it's a feature, not a bug, of a fiat money system,
[03:04:50.420 --> 03:04:52.980]   and that's where Eons made one mistake recently,
[03:04:52.980 --> 03:04:55.340]   okay, but I'm not going back to first principles.
[03:04:55.340 --> 03:04:59.260]   That deficit enables you to provide enough
[03:04:59.260 --> 03:05:01.340]   of a decent standard of living
[03:05:01.340 --> 03:05:05.660]   for those who don't come out on top in the capitalist game,
[03:05:05.660 --> 03:05:07.620]   and with that, you wouldn't have the angst
[03:05:07.620 --> 03:05:08.620]   of the young people.
[03:05:08.620 --> 03:05:12.100]   Now, we still have the climate parameters
[03:05:12.100 --> 03:05:14.260]   within which we have to survive,
[03:05:14.260 --> 03:05:16.180]   but a decent level of government funding
[03:05:16.180 --> 03:05:17.740]   would mean the angst that you get
[03:05:17.740 --> 03:05:19.900]   where people say, "I wanna be a Marxist,"
[03:05:19.900 --> 03:05:22.060]   and they've got what I call a cardboard cutout version
[03:05:22.060 --> 03:05:25.340]   of Marx in their minds, that wouldn't be happening.
[03:05:25.340 --> 03:05:29.220]   So it's potential to have a good society
[03:05:29.220 --> 03:05:30.660]   where the government runs a deficit
[03:05:30.660 --> 03:05:33.900]   that finances the needs of the poor,
[03:05:33.900 --> 03:05:36.100]   where the rich get enough to indulge
[03:05:36.100 --> 03:05:37.500]   and take care of themselves,
[03:05:37.500 --> 03:05:40.460]   and you don't get this breakdown.
[03:05:40.460 --> 03:05:43.620]   If you try to cause the government running a surplus,
[03:05:43.620 --> 03:05:45.980]   then the burden of that is borne by the poor,
[03:05:45.980 --> 03:05:47.180]   middle class and poor,
[03:05:47.180 --> 03:05:49.620]   and that will lead to the angst we're now seeing.
[03:05:49.620 --> 03:05:57.100]   - Beautiful, that was a beautiful whirlwind exploration
[03:05:57.100 --> 03:05:59.660]   of all of economics and economics history.
[03:05:59.660 --> 03:06:01.900]   Let me ask you, you tweeted, I think,
[03:06:01.900 --> 03:06:05.340]   we are the opposite of ants,
[03:06:05.340 --> 03:06:09.460]   individually intelligent, collectively stupid.
[03:06:09.460 --> 03:06:11.900]   We need to develop systems thinking fast
[03:06:11.900 --> 03:06:14.020]   to counter our limitations.
[03:06:14.020 --> 03:06:18.580]   That's really interesting.
[03:06:18.580 --> 03:06:20.820]   Do you really believe we're individually intelligent
[03:06:20.820 --> 03:06:22.100]   and collectively stupid?
[03:06:22.100 --> 03:06:22.940]   - I do.
[03:06:22.940 --> 03:06:25.580]   - Can you elaborate on, I mean,
[03:06:25.580 --> 03:06:27.420]   some of that is just cheeky tweets, but--
[03:06:27.420 --> 03:06:31.140]   - It was a cheeky tweet I've had in my mind for a long time.
[03:06:31.140 --> 03:06:33.580]   It's one that actually went moderately viral,
[03:06:33.580 --> 03:06:35.700]   not enough, but moderately viral for me.
[03:06:35.700 --> 03:06:38.820]   - But nevertheless, if you could analyze it
[03:06:38.820 --> 03:06:40.500]   as if it's some deep, profound statement
[03:06:40.500 --> 03:06:41.460]   you made in a book.
[03:06:41.460 --> 03:06:43.820]   - Well, the reason is that we are,
[03:06:43.820 --> 03:06:45.500]   like, incredibly individually intelligent.
[03:06:45.500 --> 03:06:47.580]   Things like these devices we're playing with now.
[03:06:47.580 --> 03:06:49.660]   - That's the creation of individual minds.
[03:06:49.660 --> 03:06:51.740]   - Creative individual mind and a collective labor
[03:06:51.740 --> 03:06:54.380]   over centuries that led to this level of technology,
[03:06:54.380 --> 03:06:55.820]   and that has to be respected.
[03:06:55.820 --> 03:06:58.140]   It's incredible stuff.
[03:06:58.140 --> 03:07:01.380]   But at the same time, I think what humans are,
[03:07:01.380 --> 03:07:02.580]   if you want to distinguish humans
[03:07:02.580 --> 03:07:03.940]   from other species on the planet,
[03:07:03.940 --> 03:07:06.660]   we don't weave webs, okay?
[03:07:06.660 --> 03:07:08.420]   We don't make bird calls.
[03:07:08.420 --> 03:07:10.660]   What we do is we share beliefs.
[03:07:10.660 --> 03:07:11.500]   - Yeah.
[03:07:11.500 --> 03:07:12.340]   - Okay, now--
[03:07:12.340 --> 03:07:16.700]   - You don't think that's a catalyst for intelligence?
[03:07:16.700 --> 03:07:19.500]   - Yeah, it is a catalyst, but what it means is
[03:07:19.500 --> 03:07:22.860]   we can delude ourselves as much as we can inform ourselves.
[03:07:22.860 --> 03:07:24.820]   So because we share beliefs,
[03:07:24.820 --> 03:07:27.100]   we can do things in a collective way.
[03:07:27.100 --> 03:07:28.660]   And if we believe that, you know,
[03:07:28.660 --> 03:07:31.380]   we can, if we take the incantations of the witch doctors
[03:07:31.380 --> 03:07:33.900]   and we happen to have a couple of spears
[03:07:33.900 --> 03:07:36.340]   and things, we can go and attack the local,
[03:07:37.340 --> 03:07:41.500]   the tribe of lions and drive them out,
[03:07:41.500 --> 03:07:43.380]   and we become the dominant species.
[03:07:43.380 --> 03:07:47.140]   So it worked at the stage where we were in competition
[03:07:47.140 --> 03:07:48.780]   with other species on the planet.
[03:07:48.780 --> 03:07:51.300]   Now that we're the dominant species,
[03:07:51.300 --> 03:07:53.820]   then our beliefs get in the way.
[03:07:53.820 --> 03:07:56.380]   - So you agree with Einstein who said,
[03:07:56.380 --> 03:07:59.980]   there are only two things that are infinite,
[03:07:59.980 --> 03:08:01.860]   the universe and human stupidity.
[03:08:01.860 --> 03:08:03.300]   - And he wasn't sure about the universe.
[03:08:03.300 --> 03:08:05.420]   - And he wasn't sure about the, right.
[03:08:05.420 --> 03:08:07.820]   That's right, he wasn't sure about the universe.
[03:08:07.820 --> 03:08:12.780]   Yeah, so you think that the collective, I mean,
[03:08:12.780 --> 03:08:14.820]   there's an infinity to the destructive
[03:08:14.820 --> 03:08:18.180]   and the stupid, the inhumane that's possible
[03:08:18.180 --> 03:08:19.540]   when we humans get together,
[03:08:19.540 --> 03:08:22.660]   but it feels like there's more trajectories,
[03:08:22.660 --> 03:08:24.660]   there's more possibility for creation.
[03:08:24.660 --> 03:08:27.060]   - There are, and I think that's why we have to,
[03:08:27.060 --> 03:08:29.500]   I say, if we were built around the idea
[03:08:29.500 --> 03:08:33.100]   that our role as a species is to maintain
[03:08:33.100 --> 03:08:35.220]   and extend life on the planet
[03:08:35.220 --> 03:08:39.740]   and if not find it elsewhere, then seed it elsewhere,
[03:08:39.740 --> 03:08:42.460]   then that is a vision which makes us creative
[03:08:42.460 --> 03:08:43.860]   and confines the worst elements
[03:08:43.860 --> 03:08:46.580]   of our capacities to share beliefs.
[03:08:46.580 --> 03:08:50.700]   So that's what my hope is, that we'll reach that stage,
[03:08:50.700 --> 03:08:53.300]   but I think we've overshot it so badly
[03:08:53.300 --> 03:08:56.900]   that my real fear is we'll end up blaming technology
[03:08:56.900 --> 03:08:59.540]   for the type of world we find ourselves living in
[03:08:59.540 --> 03:09:01.420]   in the next 20 to 50 years.
[03:09:01.420 --> 03:09:03.220]   - So you think technology is going to be
[03:09:03.220 --> 03:09:05.420]   one of the, part of the solution?
[03:09:05.420 --> 03:09:07.580]   - Part of the solution, yeah, but it's,
[03:09:07.580 --> 03:09:11.180]   but if we go through and blame it, which is quite possible,
[03:09:11.180 --> 03:09:12.420]   but we'll blame the technology
[03:09:12.420 --> 03:09:14.580]   rather than blaming too much of the technology
[03:09:14.580 --> 03:09:17.220]   and the too much comes down to what economists have told us,
[03:09:17.220 --> 03:09:19.820]   that we can just continue consuming infinitely
[03:09:19.820 --> 03:09:21.860]   on a finite planet, and Kenneth Boulding
[03:09:21.860 --> 03:09:23.460]   said that beautifully, he said,
[03:09:23.460 --> 03:09:26.180]   "If somebody believes that you can have exponential growth
[03:09:26.180 --> 03:09:28.160]   "on a finite planet, they're either mad
[03:09:28.160 --> 03:09:29.500]   "or they're an economist."
[03:09:30.900 --> 03:09:33.540]   So you're, you made a long journey
[03:09:33.540 --> 03:09:37.620]   for which I'm deeply honored from, from--
[03:09:37.620 --> 03:09:38.740]   - Sydney?
[03:09:38.740 --> 03:09:40.420]   - This distant place.
[03:09:40.420 --> 03:09:41.420]   - Antipodes.
[03:09:41.420 --> 03:09:42.260]   - There's myth--
[03:09:42.260 --> 03:09:43.980]   - You've got to go there one day, you'd enjoy it.
[03:09:43.980 --> 03:09:47.300]   - I will, I'm afraid if I go there, I will stay forever,
[03:09:47.300 --> 03:09:48.140]   and so--
[03:09:48.140 --> 03:09:50.640]   - No, it's a bit too, there's more vitality
[03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:52.940]   back in this economy, so you'd come back.
[03:09:52.940 --> 03:09:56.380]   - Okay, maybe, you know, I'm not a fan of the economy
[03:09:56.380 --> 03:10:01.380]   or money or any of that nature calls me.
[03:10:01.380 --> 03:10:04.680]   Let me, so I'm honored that you make that trip.
[03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:06.620]   You've also said that while you're here in Austin,
[03:10:06.620 --> 03:10:11.620]   you're going to go to this American factory
[03:10:11.620 --> 03:10:17.180]   that makes cars here in Austin, and also visit Starbase.
[03:10:17.180 --> 03:10:22.260]   So let me ask you about expanding out into the universe.
[03:10:22.260 --> 03:10:25.220]   Is that something that excites you?
[03:10:25.220 --> 03:10:26.060]   - Yeah, yeah. - You mentioned about
[03:10:26.060 --> 03:10:27.660]   the economics of it, do you think,
[03:10:27.660 --> 03:10:31.500]   what do you think Marx would think about this?
[03:10:31.500 --> 03:10:35.300]   Like, economically speaking, what is this?
[03:10:35.300 --> 03:10:36.740]   Is it a good thing?
[03:10:36.740 --> 03:10:40.820]   - I think it's vital, we can have capitalism in outer space
[03:10:40.820 --> 03:10:43.460]   far more successfully than we can have it on the planet,
[03:10:43.460 --> 03:10:45.340]   because we don't face, when we dump the waste,
[03:10:45.340 --> 03:10:47.560]   it ends up in the sun, not a problem, okay?
[03:10:47.560 --> 03:10:52.900]   So it means the potential, we don't undermine
[03:10:52.900 --> 03:10:54.780]   our own productive capacity if we're doing it
[03:10:54.780 --> 03:10:55.620]   in outer space.
[03:10:55.620 --> 03:10:58.220]   - So the destructive element of waste
[03:10:58.220 --> 03:10:59.580]   has a lesser impact in outer space.
[03:10:59.580 --> 03:11:00.420]   - Far lesser, yeah.
[03:11:00.420 --> 03:11:02.420]   I mean, who cares if we throw a bit of our iron
[03:11:02.420 --> 03:11:03.900]   back into the sun again?
[03:11:03.900 --> 03:11:05.660]   It'd take a fair bit of it to turn it into a,
[03:11:05.660 --> 03:11:08.740]   what would be the next stage, it'd be a red giant.
[03:11:08.740 --> 03:11:10.780]   And we have to get away, because if there's a red giant
[03:11:10.780 --> 03:11:14.000]   at some stage, the sun will head out past the orbit of Mars,
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:16.700]   I think, certainly past the orbit of Earth.
[03:11:16.700 --> 03:11:21.700]   So to have the longevity of not just human life,
[03:11:22.700 --> 03:11:25.180]   but life that evolved on this planet,
[03:11:25.180 --> 03:11:28.180]   we have to be able to take it off planet, ultimately.
[03:11:28.180 --> 03:11:30.640]   So if you think in the really long term,
[03:11:30.640 --> 03:11:33.220]   then it's our responsibility, if we're gonna want
[03:11:33.220 --> 03:11:37.240]   to maintain life, is to establish life off the planet.
[03:11:37.240 --> 03:11:41.520]   - What do you think about robots and AI
[03:11:41.520 --> 03:11:43.820]   as part of the expanding out into the universe?
[03:11:43.820 --> 03:11:44.660]   - Oh yeah, we have to.
[03:11:44.660 --> 03:11:46.960]   I mean, that ends labor.
[03:11:46.960 --> 03:11:50.360]   You can't go for, your daddly jaunt can't be from here
[03:11:50.360 --> 03:11:52.360]   to the asteroid belt and back again
[03:11:52.360 --> 03:11:54.200]   for dinner with your family.
[03:11:54.200 --> 03:11:57.000]   So production would be entirely mechanized.
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:58.560]   There'd have to be a handful of people
[03:11:58.560 --> 03:12:00.080]   who service the machines, but--
[03:12:00.080 --> 03:12:02.240]   - So it's about production and automation.
[03:12:02.240 --> 03:12:05.220]   What about elements of consciousness
[03:12:05.220 --> 03:12:07.640]   that make humans so special?
[03:12:07.640 --> 03:12:09.800]   What about that persisting within the machine?
[03:12:09.800 --> 03:12:12.040]   - I mean, I'm still a skeptic about us ever being able
[03:12:12.040 --> 03:12:14.840]   to create a machine which is truly conscious.
[03:12:14.840 --> 03:12:16.840]   If I can throw my, it's only two cents--
[03:12:16.840 --> 03:12:19.320]   - That would really piss off Karl Marx, by the way.
[03:12:19.320 --> 03:12:20.920]   If we create machines that are conscious.
[03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:22.960]   - Exactly, this is actually part of the,
[03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:24.360]   there's two good logical arguments
[03:12:24.360 --> 03:12:25.720]   against the labor theory of value.
[03:12:25.720 --> 03:12:28.240]   One of what it becomes, machines become intelligent.
[03:12:28.240 --> 03:12:30.320]   And the other was that if the declining rate
[03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:32.660]   of profit applies in socialism,
[03:12:32.660 --> 03:12:34.760]   it'll apply as a rate of accumulation,
[03:12:34.760 --> 03:12:37.720]   sorry, in capitalism, it'll apply as a rate of socialism
[03:12:37.720 --> 03:12:39.840]   as well, a guy called Khalid made that argument.
[03:12:39.840 --> 03:12:42.400]   So his argument was just unsound.
[03:12:42.400 --> 03:12:43.760]   But yeah, intelligent machines
[03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:45.360]   would completely screw Marx up.
[03:12:46.720 --> 03:12:49.120]   - I do not like that world where machines
[03:12:49.120 --> 03:12:53.640]   have not only intelligence, but consciousness as well.
[03:12:53.640 --> 03:12:57.560]   - And I know that's one of your interests,
[03:12:57.560 --> 03:12:59.880]   one of your potential endeavors.
[03:12:59.880 --> 03:13:03.440]   And the Kurzweil idea that there's some singularity
[03:13:03.440 --> 03:13:04.760]   we're approaching as we just get
[03:13:04.760 --> 03:13:06.480]   increasing processing power.
[03:13:06.480 --> 03:13:09.360]   It's not processing power, it's imagination.
[03:13:09.360 --> 03:13:10.200]   And I think--
[03:13:10.200 --> 03:13:12.080]   - Whatever the heck that means.
[03:13:12.080 --> 03:13:13.680]   - Whatever the heck that means, yeah.
[03:13:13.680 --> 03:13:15.880]   I mean, you would have had imaginative insights.
[03:13:15.880 --> 03:13:20.040]   I mean, your papers on like in motor,
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:21.520]   in automating motoring,
[03:13:21.520 --> 03:13:23.880]   between the hyper-intelligent machine
[03:13:23.880 --> 03:13:25.540]   or the machine-human interface,
[03:13:25.540 --> 03:13:27.840]   where the standards can be lower for the machine
[03:13:27.840 --> 03:13:28.840]   and higher for the human.
[03:13:28.840 --> 03:13:31.520]   Okay, that's an insight you would have had at some point,
[03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:33.080]   and then you've worked it further.
[03:13:33.080 --> 03:13:34.760]   So I've had insights like that as well.
[03:13:34.760 --> 03:13:36.400]   And I have no idea where they come from.
[03:13:36.400 --> 03:13:39.360]   They just hit me in the head, and I write them down,
[03:13:39.360 --> 03:13:40.920]   and they solve the problems
[03:13:40.920 --> 03:13:43.600]   that I didn't even know my mind was working on.
[03:13:43.600 --> 03:13:46.680]   So how can we get a machine to do that?
[03:13:46.680 --> 03:13:50.060]   And I do not know the answer,
[03:13:50.060 --> 03:13:51.960]   but one thing I think is the potential,
[03:13:51.960 --> 03:13:55.960]   is I think we have to create AI that has feelings,
[03:13:55.960 --> 03:13:58.320]   AI that wants to survive.
[03:13:58.320 --> 03:14:02.200]   Because if you think how our intelligence evolved,
[03:14:02.200 --> 03:14:04.080]   it's on this planet in a struggle
[03:14:04.080 --> 03:14:05.760]   between predator and prey.
[03:14:05.760 --> 03:14:08.080]   And intelligence became a survival technique.
[03:14:08.080 --> 03:14:09.840]   - I find the ideas of Ernest Becker
[03:14:09.840 --> 03:14:11.960]   with denial of death really powerful,
[03:14:11.960 --> 03:14:16.960]   which is that humans will not only have emotions
[03:14:16.960 --> 03:14:20.440]   and are trying to survive,
[03:14:20.440 --> 03:14:25.440]   they're able to ponder out in the distant future
[03:14:25.440 --> 03:14:27.880]   their mortality.
[03:14:27.880 --> 03:14:28.720]   - Yes.
[03:14:28.720 --> 03:14:32.520]   - And that is a driving force for even greater creation
[03:14:32.520 --> 03:14:37.520]   that animals are able to do, more primitive animals.
[03:14:38.720 --> 03:14:42.320]   And so there is some element where I agree with you.
[03:14:42.320 --> 03:14:46.600]   I think for AI systems to have something like consciousness,
[03:14:46.600 --> 03:14:49.120]   they have to fear their mortality.
[03:14:49.120 --> 03:14:50.200]   - Exactly.
[03:14:50.200 --> 03:14:52.440]   And I think that's, if you do it then,
[03:14:52.440 --> 03:14:57.440]   you can't produce an AI whose behavior you can control.
[03:14:57.440 --> 03:15:00.400]   - I mean, when you have kids.
[03:15:00.400 --> 03:15:01.240]   - Yeah, you're doing it.
[03:15:01.240 --> 03:15:02.800]   - You can't control their behavior.
[03:15:02.800 --> 03:15:04.640]   (laughing)
[03:15:04.640 --> 03:15:06.280]   That's the trade-off.
[03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:07.920]   - You give life to an anarchist.
[03:15:07.920 --> 03:15:10.840]   I got one of my favorite instances in my family life
[03:15:10.840 --> 03:15:15.520]   is one of my, I like all my nieces and nephews,
[03:15:15.520 --> 03:15:17.320]   but one's got a real quirk to her.
[03:15:17.320 --> 03:15:19.720]   And I was standing over her cot
[03:15:19.720 --> 03:15:22.400]   when she was literally like about six months old
[03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:24.560]   and she was gurgling away to herself.
[03:15:24.560 --> 03:15:27.040]   And her father waved his fingers,
[03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:28.840]   said, "Stop making that noise."
[03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:32.080]   And this little six-month-old kid goes, "Zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo."
[03:15:32.080 --> 03:15:33.840]   And I said, "Boy, you're gonna have issues
[03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:34.800]   "with that one, mate."
[03:15:34.800 --> 03:15:37.240]   - Yeah, an anarchist was born.
[03:15:37.240 --> 03:15:39.440]   - Yeah, and so you can't control this life
[03:15:39.440 --> 03:15:42.080]   you give birth to, and that's, I think, the threat of AI.
[03:15:42.080 --> 03:15:43.800]   - Terrifying and exciting.
[03:15:43.800 --> 03:15:47.480]   - It is, and I think we should take that risk at some stage.
[03:15:47.480 --> 03:15:50.200]   But I think to do it with what actually let
[03:15:50.200 --> 03:15:53.680]   artificial intelligence involve in this environment
[03:15:53.680 --> 03:15:55.880]   in which it fears its own death.
[03:15:55.880 --> 03:15:58.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:15:58.080 --> 03:15:59.720]   I think there's a lot of beauty there,
[03:15:59.720 --> 03:16:01.240]   but there's also--
[03:16:01.240 --> 03:16:02.400]   - A lot of fear.
[03:16:02.400 --> 03:16:04.080]   - A lot of destruction that's possible,
[03:16:04.080 --> 03:16:05.800]   so you have to be extremely careful.
[03:16:05.800 --> 03:16:07.920]   That's kind of the cutting edge
[03:16:07.920 --> 03:16:10.600]   at which we often operate as a humanity.
[03:16:10.600 --> 03:16:14.240]   Let me ask you for advice.
[03:16:14.240 --> 03:16:16.520]   Can you give advice to young people
[03:16:16.520 --> 03:16:18.280]   in high school and college?
[03:16:18.280 --> 03:16:22.120]   Maybe they're interested in economics.
[03:16:22.120 --> 03:16:24.800]   Maybe they have other career ideas.
[03:16:24.800 --> 03:16:27.400]   What advice would you give them about a career
[03:16:27.400 --> 03:16:29.280]   they can have that they can be proud of
[03:16:29.280 --> 03:16:31.520]   or a life they can be proud of?
[03:16:31.520 --> 03:16:34.200]   - Mainly in a career, I say don't do an economics degree.
[03:16:34.200 --> 03:16:35.520]   (laughing)
[03:16:35.520 --> 03:16:36.760]   I say if--
[03:16:36.760 --> 03:16:38.960]   - There's a little book--
[03:16:38.960 --> 03:16:40.080]   - Econ Comics.
[03:16:40.080 --> 03:16:44.840]   - Econ Comics, Taking the Con Out of Economics.
[03:16:44.840 --> 03:16:47.600]   So they should start with that
[03:16:47.600 --> 03:16:50.760]   and then say screw it to an economics degree.
[03:16:50.760 --> 03:16:54.280]   - Yeah, because what you learn is an obsolete technology.
[03:16:54.280 --> 03:16:56.160]   Learning economics at a university
[03:16:56.160 --> 03:16:58.120]   is like learning to make astronomy.
[03:16:58.120 --> 03:17:02.320]   Okay, the centric equilibrium,
[03:17:04.120 --> 03:17:06.840]   epicycles being added to make your models fit the data.
[03:17:06.840 --> 03:17:08.320]   - So it's not that economics
[03:17:08.320 --> 03:17:10.960]   is not a discipline worth deeply studying.
[03:17:10.960 --> 03:17:13.280]   It's that the university education around economics--
[03:17:13.280 --> 03:17:14.120]   - Is so bad.
[03:17:14.120 --> 03:17:14.960]   - Is bad.
[03:17:14.960 --> 03:17:17.040]   - So I'd say learn system dynamics.
[03:17:17.040 --> 03:17:18.560]   Do a course in system dynamics
[03:17:18.560 --> 03:17:20.480]   which you can apply in any field
[03:17:20.480 --> 03:17:23.680]   and then apply what you learn out of system dynamics
[03:17:23.680 --> 03:17:26.360]   to the issues of economics if that's what interests you.
[03:17:26.360 --> 03:17:30.120]   - So get a sort of base engineering education.
[03:17:30.120 --> 03:17:32.400]   - A base engineering education.
[03:17:32.400 --> 03:17:35.040]   That is far better than doing an economics degree.
[03:17:35.040 --> 03:17:36.360]   In terms of life,
[03:17:36.360 --> 03:17:40.120]   my life is pretty chaotic in many, many ways.
[03:17:40.120 --> 03:17:43.280]   My friends and family will tell me that at every opportunity
[03:17:43.280 --> 03:17:45.720]   but the thing is, I once had a,
[03:17:45.720 --> 03:17:46.720]   this will tell you an example
[03:17:46.720 --> 03:17:49.400]   of a really funny incident that occurred to me
[03:17:49.400 --> 03:17:51.360]   'cause I led the student revolt at Sydney University
[03:17:51.360 --> 03:17:53.240]   as I mentioned, I was 20 years old.
[03:17:53.240 --> 03:17:56.240]   And then in my, I think about 28 or so,
[03:17:56.240 --> 03:17:57.520]   I went to a restaurant one night
[03:17:57.520 --> 03:18:00.680]   and I found a bunch of guys, all guys,
[03:18:00.680 --> 03:18:02.320]   who'd done accounting at the university
[03:18:02.320 --> 03:18:04.720]   but had also been part of the student revolt.
[03:18:04.720 --> 03:18:06.520]   So they hadn't seen me for about a decade
[03:18:06.520 --> 03:18:07.960]   and they said, "What have you been doing, Steve?"
[03:18:07.960 --> 03:18:09.040]   And I talked about what I'd done.
[03:18:09.040 --> 03:18:11.080]   So I'd been a school teacher for a while.
[03:18:11.080 --> 03:18:13.480]   I then worked in overseas aid.
[03:18:13.480 --> 03:18:15.840]   I was doing computer programming at the time
[03:18:15.840 --> 03:18:18.240]   and I'd forgotten what else I was doing at that point.
[03:18:18.240 --> 03:18:19.800]   So I explained it to all of them
[03:18:19.800 --> 03:18:20.720]   and they were at a Bucs night,
[03:18:20.720 --> 03:18:23.160]   one of them having a wedding coming up the next week.
[03:18:23.160 --> 03:18:27.000]   And one of them said, "I wish I'd done that."
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:29.040]   And there was silence around the table.
[03:18:29.040 --> 03:18:31.320]   There was obviously silent agreement.
[03:18:31.320 --> 03:18:32.360]   And I looked at them and said,
[03:18:32.360 --> 03:18:35.600]   "Hang on, guys, look at the downside of my life.
[03:18:35.600 --> 03:18:38.080]   "Like you're getting married.
[03:18:38.080 --> 03:18:40.760]   "I don't have a girlfriend right now.
[03:18:40.760 --> 03:18:42.940]   "You've all got secure jobs.
[03:18:42.940 --> 03:18:44.780]   "I'm unemployed, okay?
[03:18:44.780 --> 03:18:45.960]   "I don't, you own a house.
[03:18:45.960 --> 03:18:47.560]   "I haven't even got a car.
[03:18:47.560 --> 03:18:49.320]   "Look at the downside of my life."
[03:18:49.320 --> 03:18:51.120]   And the bloke who was the kingpin of that group,
[03:18:51.120 --> 03:18:52.960]   they're a very innovative bunch of guys
[03:18:52.960 --> 03:18:54.200]   in the student revolt.
[03:18:54.200 --> 03:18:58.980]   So he said, "Steve, we would still all rather have done
[03:18:58.980 --> 03:19:00.280]   "what you have done."
[03:19:01.140 --> 03:19:03.760]   And they did accounting because it was safe.
[03:19:03.760 --> 03:19:04.600]   You could always get a job.
[03:19:04.600 --> 03:19:06.800]   They were bored shitless.
[03:19:06.800 --> 03:19:10.080]   - Did you have a sense that the chaos
[03:19:10.080 --> 03:19:14.120]   you're always jumping into was dangerous
[03:19:14.120 --> 03:19:16.920]   or was it just the pull of it that--
[03:19:16.920 --> 03:19:18.920]   - I simply couldn't not do it.
[03:19:18.920 --> 03:19:20.920]   It was part of me that I couldn't swallow
[03:19:20.920 --> 03:19:22.020]   this economic stuff.
[03:19:22.020 --> 03:19:24.960]   Once I was exposed to why it was so wrong,
[03:19:24.960 --> 03:19:28.520]   then I was on a crusade to make it right.
[03:19:28.520 --> 03:19:31.520]   And that's been part of my nature all through my life.
[03:19:31.520 --> 03:19:32.700]   I don't know why.
[03:19:32.700 --> 03:19:35.160]   So it wasn't that I made a choice to do it,
[03:19:35.160 --> 03:19:38.520]   it's that I couldn't be true to myself without doing it.
[03:19:38.520 --> 03:19:40.760]   And I find a lot of people get caught in a life
[03:19:40.760 --> 03:19:42.400]   where they're doing it because it works
[03:19:42.400 --> 03:19:44.260]   for some financial or other reason,
[03:19:44.260 --> 03:19:46.200]   but they're not being true to themselves.
[03:19:46.200 --> 03:19:47.920]   And as messy as my life is,
[03:19:47.920 --> 03:19:50.000]   as much shit I've got myself caught up in,
[03:19:50.000 --> 03:19:51.440]   and there's a lot of that in my personal
[03:19:51.440 --> 03:19:52.760]   and financial life right now,
[03:19:52.760 --> 03:19:54.220]   which is a pain in the ass,
[03:19:54.220 --> 03:19:57.940]   I would rather have had that nature than not.
[03:19:58.660 --> 03:20:01.220]   - You would rather take the pain in the ass than not.
[03:20:01.220 --> 03:20:02.640]   - Yep, yep.
[03:20:02.640 --> 03:20:04.300]   - Let me ask a dark question.
[03:20:04.300 --> 03:20:09.740]   What's the darkest place you've ever gone to in your mind?
[03:20:09.740 --> 03:20:12.420]   So in all that rollercoaster of life,
[03:20:12.420 --> 03:20:15.220]   have there been periods where it's been really--
[03:20:15.220 --> 03:20:17.100]   - I think I've had to cope with depression
[03:20:17.100 --> 03:20:19.540]   in the last five years,
[03:20:19.540 --> 03:20:22.580]   since I started reading Neoclassical Economist
[03:20:22.580 --> 03:20:23.980]   on climate change.
[03:20:23.980 --> 03:20:24.820]   - Sorry to laugh.
[03:20:24.820 --> 03:20:25.660]   - Gotta come back to that one.
[03:20:25.660 --> 03:20:27.980]   - That's where my wife's gonna come into this story.
[03:20:27.980 --> 03:20:30.700]   So I was reading Richard Toll,
[03:20:30.700 --> 03:20:34.620]   a paper from 2009 called "The Economics of Climate Change,"
[03:20:34.620 --> 03:20:37.060]   Journal of Economic Perspectives, I think.
[03:20:37.060 --> 03:20:38.940]   And I read this section where he says
[03:20:38.940 --> 03:20:43.220]   that one of the ways they tried to calibrate
[03:20:43.220 --> 03:20:46.060]   what climate change was due is they assumed
[03:20:46.060 --> 03:20:48.620]   that the relationship between GDP and temperature
[03:20:48.620 --> 03:20:51.880]   over space would apply over time as well.
[03:20:51.880 --> 03:20:54.140]   - Yes.
[03:20:54.140 --> 03:20:58.260]   - And I read that and thought that is so fucking stupid.
[03:20:58.260 --> 03:20:59.300]   'Cause all it's saying is that
[03:20:59.300 --> 03:21:00.980]   if there's a 10 degree temperature difference
[03:21:00.980 --> 03:21:02.740]   between New York and Florida
[03:21:02.740 --> 03:21:04.700]   and a 20% difference in income,
[03:21:04.700 --> 03:21:06.220]   then a 10 degree increase in temperature
[03:21:06.220 --> 03:21:08.340]   will cause GDP to fall by 20%.
[03:21:08.340 --> 03:21:10.260]   It is so insanely stupid.
[03:21:10.260 --> 03:21:14.660]   So when I read that line, I just did this.
[03:21:14.660 --> 03:21:18.260]   I just, you know, I was in shock at how stupid it was.
[03:21:18.260 --> 03:21:22.580]   My wife, who's Thai and brings in treats for me all day,
[03:21:22.580 --> 03:21:26.300]   walks into the room and she speaks in a staccato English
[03:21:26.300 --> 03:21:29.300]   and says to me, "Why are you like this?"
[03:21:29.300 --> 03:21:31.700]   And I said, "I'm just doing this work on climate change."
[03:21:31.700 --> 03:21:32.600]   And she interrupts me and says,
[03:21:32.600 --> 03:21:34.780]   "Oh, why you do that stuff?
[03:21:34.780 --> 03:21:36.620]   "Nobody's interested in climate change.
[03:21:36.620 --> 03:21:37.940]   "You can't do anything to change it.
[03:21:37.940 --> 03:21:39.280]   "If we die, we die."
[03:21:39.280 --> 03:21:44.300]   And that's perfect Buddhist grounding, you know?
[03:21:44.300 --> 03:21:47.380]   And I thought, well, I can't argue with her again.
[03:21:47.380 --> 03:21:51.220]   So that sort of stopped me on the depression,
[03:21:51.220 --> 03:21:53.420]   but that's the darkest point when I looked at it
[03:21:53.420 --> 03:21:56.140]   and I thought that this arrogance, this stupidity,
[03:21:56.140 --> 03:22:00.900]   this humbug in the economists meant
[03:22:00.900 --> 03:22:03.260]   that we were potentially jeopardizing the lives
[03:22:03.260 --> 03:22:04.420]   of billions of people,
[03:22:04.420 --> 03:22:08.020]   and Christ knows how many other life forms.
[03:22:08.020 --> 03:22:10.020]   And having that knowledge
[03:22:10.020 --> 03:22:12.620]   is the most depressing experience of my life.
[03:22:12.620 --> 03:22:18.540]   - That ideas, simple models combined with arrogance
[03:22:19.620 --> 03:22:23.100]   can lead to the potential destruction
[03:22:23.100 --> 03:22:23.940]   of human civilization.
[03:22:23.940 --> 03:22:25.700]   That was a very heavy,
[03:22:25.700 --> 03:22:28.740]   and then your wife came in with--
[03:22:28.740 --> 03:22:29.900]   - And broke me out of it.
[03:22:29.900 --> 03:22:33.140]   - Nature wins in the end.
[03:22:33.140 --> 03:22:33.980]   - Yeah, and that's--
[03:22:33.980 --> 03:22:35.780]   - And sort of accept the flow of life.
[03:22:35.780 --> 03:22:38.580]   - You should really enjoy that book, "The Earth of Odds,"
[03:22:38.580 --> 03:22:40.920]   because it's got that same beautiful sense to it.
[03:22:40.920 --> 03:22:42.860]   Life will survive whatever we do.
[03:22:42.860 --> 03:22:45.180]   I mean, they talk about the people,
[03:22:45.180 --> 03:22:46.660]   I was actually talking with a good mate of mine,
[03:22:46.660 --> 03:22:49.540]   an ex-geologist, and he's now a professor of economics,
[03:22:49.540 --> 03:22:50.820]   and he said as a geologist,
[03:22:50.820 --> 03:22:54.820]   he really hated people talking about the Anthropocene Epoch.
[03:22:54.820 --> 03:22:57.980]   And I said, "Well, it shouldn't be the Anthropocene Epoch,
[03:22:57.980 --> 03:23:00.580]   "it'll be the Anthropocene Event,
[03:23:00.580 --> 03:23:02.460]   "because an epoch is millions of years,
[03:23:02.460 --> 03:23:06.660]   "and it'd be a huge period of life on the planet,
[03:23:06.660 --> 03:23:08.800]   "and we might be snuffed out
[03:23:08.800 --> 03:23:12.260]   "in 10,000 years of human civilization."
[03:23:12.260 --> 03:23:14.980]   And that's not much slower
[03:23:14.980 --> 03:23:16.780]   than the meteors wiping out the dinosaurs.
[03:23:16.780 --> 03:23:19.380]   The dinosaurs lasted for a long time after that event.
[03:23:19.380 --> 03:23:22.220]   So we're like, we'd just be a layer
[03:23:22.220 --> 03:23:24.500]   in the surface of the planet
[03:23:24.500 --> 03:23:29.020]   with plastics and strange metals like that at some point.
[03:23:29.020 --> 03:23:32.380]   So we're just, but life will abide, life will survive us.
[03:23:32.380 --> 03:23:35.100]   But there's so much life we're gonna take down with us
[03:23:35.100 --> 03:23:37.180]   in this whole period,
[03:23:37.180 --> 03:23:40.820]   and there's so many of our own lives we're gonna terminate
[03:23:40.820 --> 03:23:41.860]   for no good reason.
[03:23:41.860 --> 03:23:46.220]   - I'm looking at this Richard Tull character,
[03:23:46.220 --> 03:23:48.060]   I'll definitely have to look at some of his papers.
[03:23:48.060 --> 03:23:51.820]   It does look like, boy, is he oversimplifying
[03:23:51.820 --> 03:23:53.620]   and do a lot of people-- - Oh my God.
[03:23:53.620 --> 03:23:55.020]   Check his one on the Anthro,
[03:23:55.020 --> 03:23:57.340]   how good it'll be to lose Amok.
[03:23:57.340 --> 03:24:00.700]   - That said, I'm going to approach
[03:24:00.700 --> 03:24:02.860]   all of these topics with humility,
[03:24:02.860 --> 03:24:04.900]   and I would like to have some conversations
[03:24:04.900 --> 03:24:06.160]   if people can recommend.
[03:24:06.160 --> 03:24:09.940]   My default position is always with the scientists,
[03:24:09.940 --> 03:24:12.260]   but even above that, my default position
[03:24:12.260 --> 03:24:15.740]   is with those who are humble versus those who are arrogant.
[03:24:16.860 --> 03:24:19.940]   - This idea that because you're a quote unquote expert,
[03:24:19.940 --> 03:24:23.180]   you deserve to have arrogance is a silly idea to me.
[03:24:23.180 --> 03:24:27.500]   Again, going to the broader view of life on Earth,
[03:24:27.500 --> 03:24:31.140]   nature, nature's the only one that gets to be arrogant,
[03:24:31.140 --> 03:24:35.220]   and it chooses not to. (laughing)
[03:24:35.220 --> 03:24:38.060]   So let me ask you about love.
[03:24:38.060 --> 03:24:41.620]   What role does love play in this whole thing?
[03:24:41.620 --> 03:24:43.660]   Did Karl Marx have a model for that?
[03:24:43.660 --> 03:24:46.820]   - Oh, Marx was madly in love with Geneva on West Island.
[03:24:46.820 --> 03:24:48.580]   And wrote love poetry to her
[03:24:48.580 --> 03:24:50.820]   long before he wrote "Das Kapital."
[03:24:50.820 --> 03:24:52.540]   And he was infatuated with her.
[03:24:52.540 --> 03:24:56.940]   He ended up also impregnating his housekeeper.
[03:24:56.940 --> 03:24:59.020]   So there's the son of Karl Marx,
[03:24:59.020 --> 03:25:02.700]   who was the son of the housekeeper, not the Jenny.
[03:25:02.700 --> 03:25:04.100]   There are numerous daughters.
[03:25:04.100 --> 03:25:09.180]   - So he had a complicated view of love.
[03:25:09.180 --> 03:25:10.580]   - Oh yeah.
[03:25:10.580 --> 03:25:12.500]   - There's a dialectic on love there.
[03:25:12.500 --> 03:25:15.940]   - He had an idealistic view with Jenny,
[03:25:15.940 --> 03:25:19.860]   and he was rejected because he wasn't, not by Jenny.
[03:25:19.860 --> 03:25:21.940]   She was madly in love with him as well.
[03:25:21.940 --> 03:25:25.340]   So it was a real passionate love affair from the very outset.
[03:25:25.340 --> 03:25:28.540]   But then, of course, you have children, lots of them die.
[03:25:28.540 --> 03:25:31.140]   There's a huge amount of tragedy in his life as well.
[03:25:31.140 --> 03:25:34.980]   He and Jenny were forced out of Chelsea
[03:25:34.980 --> 03:25:37.140]   by a cholera epidemic.
[03:25:37.140 --> 03:25:40.020]   My vision for London back in the 1850s and '60s
[03:25:40.020 --> 03:25:43.500]   was Calcutta in the 1970s.
[03:25:43.500 --> 03:25:45.100]   That's really what life was like.
[03:25:45.100 --> 03:25:47.660]   So there's a lot of hardship in his life as well.
[03:25:47.660 --> 03:25:49.240]   And he was always poor.
[03:25:49.240 --> 03:25:54.700]   So only Ingalls kept him alive financially.
[03:25:54.700 --> 03:25:57.080]   He applied for one job outside of,
[03:25:57.080 --> 03:26:01.620]   he never got an academic job.
[03:26:01.620 --> 03:26:04.340]   He was pushed out of Prussia as a newspaper author.
[03:26:04.340 --> 03:26:08.420]   But he also, he applied for a job as a clerk
[03:26:08.420 --> 03:26:09.980]   in the British railway system,
[03:26:09.980 --> 03:26:12.740]   was turned down 'cause they couldn't read his handwriting.
[03:26:12.740 --> 03:26:17.380]   So I think I'm a bit similar there.
[03:26:17.380 --> 03:26:20.980]   So yeah, there's a lot of love and passion.
[03:26:20.980 --> 03:26:23.340]   - But in general, what do you think is the role of love
[03:26:23.340 --> 03:26:24.380]   in the human condition?
[03:26:24.380 --> 03:26:25.220]   - It's vital.
[03:26:25.220 --> 03:26:31.220]   I mean, that feeling of passionate desire
[03:26:31.220 --> 03:26:33.460]   and respect for somebody else.
[03:26:33.460 --> 03:26:35.220]   And there's perverted forms of love as well,
[03:26:35.220 --> 03:26:36.420]   so I'll leave that out.
[03:26:36.420 --> 03:26:40.260]   But somebody having a really, a deep bond
[03:26:40.260 --> 03:26:44.180]   which goes beyond just sexual attraction.
[03:26:44.180 --> 03:26:46.420]   I like I've had that four or five times in my life
[03:26:46.420 --> 03:26:48.420]   with different women at different times.
[03:26:48.420 --> 03:26:51.220]   And I've stuffed up the most important one very early on.
[03:26:51.220 --> 03:26:55.460]   And that feeling is incredible.
[03:26:55.460 --> 03:27:00.460]   And you couldn't have life worth living without that.
[03:27:00.460 --> 03:27:03.980]   So it's an essential part of who we are.
[03:27:03.980 --> 03:27:05.940]   But what we have to do is to transfer it
[03:27:05.940 --> 03:27:08.240]   not just to the rest of our species,
[03:27:08.240 --> 03:27:09.980]   but to all the species.
[03:27:09.980 --> 03:27:12.900]   And that's, I think, what's vital.
[03:27:12.900 --> 03:27:16.820]   And how do we maintain that over generations?
[03:27:16.820 --> 03:27:20.820]   And I think that idea that we can actually hang on
[03:27:20.820 --> 03:27:23.140]   to that general sense of respect and not lose it again.
[03:27:23.140 --> 03:27:26.040]   'Cause the amount of life we've terminated on this planet,
[03:27:26.040 --> 03:27:29.500]   the warlike side of humanity,
[03:27:29.500 --> 03:27:32.860]   that is too much of a defining feature of our species.
[03:27:32.860 --> 03:27:35.100]   That's the opposite of love, it's hate.
[03:27:35.100 --> 03:27:37.140]   But it's pleasure and inflicting pain on others.
[03:27:37.140 --> 03:27:38.900]   When you see people killing others
[03:27:38.900 --> 03:27:41.560]   in a warlike environment, they're enjoying themselves.
[03:27:41.560 --> 03:27:44.660]   It's rarely, sometimes it's self-defense.
[03:27:44.660 --> 03:27:47.420]   But when you have spoken to people
[03:27:47.420 --> 03:27:49.100]   who've been involved in combat
[03:27:49.100 --> 03:27:51.420]   and been involved in riots and said,
[03:27:51.420 --> 03:27:53.460]   when you see somebody rioting, bashing people up,
[03:27:53.460 --> 03:27:54.820]   they're enjoying themselves.
[03:27:54.820 --> 03:27:56.740]   It's not anger, they're feeling, it's pleasure.
[03:27:56.740 --> 03:27:58.420]   - There's a dark aspect to human nature.
[03:27:58.420 --> 03:27:59.380]   - Very dark.
[03:27:59.380 --> 03:28:04.380]   - But there's also the capacity to rise above that.
[03:28:04.380 --> 03:28:06.420]   - And I think, like I put us on a spectrum
[03:28:06.420 --> 03:28:08.020]   between chimpanzees at one extreme
[03:28:08.020 --> 03:28:09.700]   and bonobos at the other.
[03:28:09.700 --> 03:28:11.580]   We're too close to the chimpanzees.
[03:28:11.580 --> 03:28:15.020]   - And bonobos are just having fun, having lots of sex.
[03:28:15.020 --> 03:28:16.220]   - Every time they do anything,
[03:28:16.220 --> 03:28:17.780]   they fuck first and do the work later
[03:28:17.780 --> 03:28:19.740]   and then fuck afterwards to celebrate.
[03:28:19.740 --> 03:28:21.540]   - Fuck first, ask questions later.
[03:28:21.540 --> 03:28:23.900]   It's like that "Scent of a Woman,"
[03:28:23.900 --> 03:28:25.620]   one of my favorite films,
[03:28:25.620 --> 03:28:28.620]   where Al Pacino gives advice to a cat.
[03:28:28.620 --> 03:28:30.420]   He says, "When in doubt, fuck."
[03:28:30.420 --> 03:28:32.900]   (laughing)
[03:28:32.900 --> 03:28:35.100]   It's good life advice for a cat, especially.
[03:28:36.060 --> 03:28:39.820]   - We mentioned that death seems to be maybe fundamental
[03:28:39.820 --> 03:28:42.100]   to creating a conscious AI.
[03:28:42.100 --> 03:28:45.060]   Do you think about your own death?
[03:28:45.060 --> 03:28:48.660]   Are you afraid of it?
[03:28:48.660 --> 03:28:51.620]   - I'm afraid of going through it.
[03:28:51.620 --> 03:28:55.340]   - Not the other side?
[03:28:55.340 --> 03:28:56.980]   You're not afraid of being on the other side?
[03:28:56.980 --> 03:28:58.420]   - I don't think there is another side.
[03:28:58.420 --> 03:29:00.580]   I mean, I'm agnostic.
[03:29:00.580 --> 03:29:02.740]   I'm atheist when pressed and agnostic.
[03:29:02.740 --> 03:29:04.860]   The one thing that I think I can understand
[03:29:04.860 --> 03:29:07.540]   why religion exists is that the whole thing
[03:29:07.540 --> 03:29:10.060]   that something exists is itself a dilemma.
[03:29:10.060 --> 03:29:13.620]   You have to take on faith that reality exists,
[03:29:13.620 --> 03:29:17.660]   whether it's a simulation or actual reality, it exists.
[03:29:17.660 --> 03:29:20.780]   And that itself can't be explained in any scientific manner.
[03:29:20.780 --> 03:29:23.700]   I mean, you can talk about anti-protons and protons
[03:29:23.700 --> 03:29:25.340]   and the sum being zero and so on,
[03:29:25.340 --> 03:29:27.660]   but why did it even happen in the first place?
[03:29:27.660 --> 03:29:30.100]   So there's part you simply have to take on faith.
[03:29:30.100 --> 03:29:33.580]   - So there was darkness before.
[03:29:34.700 --> 03:29:35.540]   - We don't know.
[03:29:35.540 --> 03:29:36.780]   - And there's darkness after.
[03:29:36.780 --> 03:29:38.420]   - Yeah, and I don't know if we're gonna be alive
[03:29:38.420 --> 03:29:39.580]   on the other side of that darkness.
[03:29:39.580 --> 03:29:41.220]   I think individually, no.
[03:29:41.220 --> 03:29:42.420]   But the way you can live on
[03:29:42.420 --> 03:29:44.980]   is by what you do to human consciousness.
[03:29:44.980 --> 03:29:47.380]   - How do you hope people remember you?
[03:29:47.380 --> 03:29:54.260]   - As someone who managed to integrate economics
[03:29:54.260 --> 03:29:56.020]   with an appreciation for life.
[03:29:56.020 --> 03:30:03.020]   - Well, I have to say, as a bit of a callback,
[03:30:03.020 --> 03:30:05.220]   you're one deadly bastard.
[03:30:05.220 --> 03:30:06.620]   (laughing)
[03:30:06.620 --> 03:30:08.980]   It's a huge honor that you would come down and talk to me.
[03:30:08.980 --> 03:30:11.620]   You're a brilliant person, you're a hilarious person.
[03:30:11.620 --> 03:30:13.940]   The humility shines through, the brilliance shines through.
[03:30:13.940 --> 03:30:14.780]   Thank you so much for spending this time.
[03:30:14.780 --> 03:30:16.020]   - Well, thank you, Alex.
[03:30:16.020 --> 03:30:17.580]   You do the same for humanity.
[03:30:17.580 --> 03:30:19.580]   I mean, when I saw that email from you,
[03:30:19.580 --> 03:30:21.900]   my eyes popped out on my head, okay?
[03:30:21.900 --> 03:30:23.540]   - Well, you should hold your judgment.
[03:30:23.540 --> 03:30:25.580]   I gotta show you the sex dungeon I have.
[03:30:25.580 --> 03:30:26.420]   (laughing)
[03:30:26.420 --> 03:30:27.240]   You'll completely change--
[03:30:27.240 --> 03:30:28.900]   - I'm waiting for an invitation.
[03:30:28.900 --> 03:30:30.300]   I'll send my wife over.
[03:30:30.300 --> 03:30:31.900]   - Awesome, can't wait, all right.
[03:30:31.900 --> 03:30:32.740]   - Okay, mate.
[03:30:33.500 --> 03:30:36.260]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Steve Keen.
[03:30:36.260 --> 03:30:37.500]   To support this podcast,
[03:30:37.500 --> 03:30:40.220]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[03:30:40.220 --> 03:30:44.260]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.
[03:30:44.260 --> 03:30:48.460]   To be radical is to grasp things at their root.
[03:30:48.460 --> 03:30:53.020]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[03:30:53.020 --> 03:30:55.600]   (upbeat music)
[03:30:55.600 --> 03:30:58.180]   (upbeat music)
[03:30:58.180 --> 03:31:08.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
