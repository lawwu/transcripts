[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:58.300]  ,
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:06.740]   check
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.780]   M And I check if
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:51.320]   Transportation and the rest of the US. So you are moving outside of the US and you and your wife are US citizens. Is that right? Yes. My wife is in the process of completing the citizenship process. She will be for remove. Got it. Okay. So both of you will be US citizens. So that makes things a little bit simpler. And you intend to be gone for an extended period of time. Do you think you'll ever come back to the US?
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.660]   We think we'll be coming back to visit, you know, family and friends every so often every couple years is what we're expecting. But we are transitioning as a permanent move. At least that's our thinking for an extended period of time.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.800]   face
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:46.320]   self, is,
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:05:00.580]   Exclusion Act.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.160]   There we go, great.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.940]   Is that the proper name of it?
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.900]   Did I make it up properly?
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:12.920]   No, I think it's around $100,000 that you're excluded, you know, have to pay taxes on.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.380]   Exactly.
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.740]   So, if you look at your income, for example, if you're a U.S. citizen and a U.S. resident,
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.700]   if you look at your income and you're going, you're planning to be abroad on a business
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.700]   and you're going to be in a business that's going to be in a business that's going to
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.700]   and you're planning to be abroad on a business that's going to be in a business that's
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.700]   the U.S. citizen and a U.S. resident,
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.700]   if you look at your income and you're planning to be abroad on a business that's going to
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:52.720]   the U.S. citizen and a U.S. resident,
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   and you're planning to be abroad on a business that's going to
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   and you're planning to be abroad on a business that's going to
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   and you're planning to be abroad on a business that's going to
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   and you're planning to be abroad on a business that's going to
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   and you're planning to be abroad on a business that's going to
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:02.620]  llen
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.760]   .
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.380]   OSI is that you're planning to earn millions of dollars over the next couple of years, is that right?
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.600]   I would not expect so.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:38.520]   There should be a raise, there should be an increase, but I would think it would be a long time, probably, or if not ever, crossing that threshold number, unless that's lowered.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.360]   Right, okay.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.400]   So then in this case, and I think it's...
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.040]   Related to that, absolutely.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.480]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.300]   I'm wondering if I am not paying U.S. taxes.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.280]   Am I still eligible for a Roth?
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.340]   Am I still eligible for a Roth?

[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:07.520]   So you can move your domicile to what's called a commercial mail receiving agency in those states, a CMRA, a commercial mail receiving agency in those states. And there are a number of RV clubs that advertise this as a standard part of their services. The benefit of moving to either Texas or Florida is largely that you can avoid state income taxes. I can't remember what the state income tax is in South Dakota, but you can move your domicile legally to Florida or Texas and become a Florida resident.

[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:52.560]   Ok, so the biggest benefit if you have two children is for...as far as the biggest need for you to have a will, is to use that will to establish guardianship. If you and your wife died while you are abroad, would it be your intent that your children are returned to the United States to live with their guardians?
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.560]   Most likely. Most likely, yes.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:03.560]   So, under those circumstances, I would keep my U.S. domicile and my U.S. residence, and I would have my will filed in my state of domicile.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   Ok.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   The U.S. will be filed in my state of domicile.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   The U.S. will be filed in my state of domicile.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   The U.S. will be filed in my state of domicile.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   The U.S. will be filed in my state of domicile.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   The U.S. will be filed in my state of domicile.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:34.600]   I would have my U.S. will be filed in my state of domicile.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   I would have my U.S. will be filed in my state of domicile.

[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:34.720]   of freedom given to the trustee to manage the money for the benefit of the children in whatever way they see possible.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.920]   And what you can establish with your attorney is establish the opportunity for them to have basic,
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:47.860]   you know, basic money coming out for their use called HEMS health education, maintenance and support.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.880]   Just the basic levels of of support that they need.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.300]   You can establish that the trustee has the authority.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:53.300]   The first funds for the trustee.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:53.300]   You can establish that the trustee has the authority to disperse funds for the trustee.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:53.300]   You can establish that the trustee has the authority to disperse funds for the trustee.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:53.300]   You can establish that the trustee has the authority to disperse funds for the trustee.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:53.300]   You can establish that the trustee has the authority to disperse funds for the trustee.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:53.300]   You can establish that the trustee has the authority to disperse funds for the trustee.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:19:21.540]   I think that's what we're trying to do.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:21.560]   And then you can establish a time or multiple times at which the full balance of the money in the estate becomes available to them.
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:28.420]   And so what I like to do is to encourage you to establish that testamentary trust that would be handled for your children.
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.280]   File that in your will.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:37.480]   And then that trust is what should be placed as the beneficiary of your 401 accounts of your investment accounts.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.460]   That trust should be the beneficiary of your life insurance policies.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.440]   And then you have a very simple financial life.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.820]   If you and your wife die, your children are returned to the United States.
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.440]   The guardian is established.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.260]   The guardian does have to go before the court to be officially approved.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:49.260]   The guardian does have to go before the court to be officially approved.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:49.260]   The guardian does have to go before the court to be officially approved.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:49.800]   The guardian does have to go before the court to be officially approved.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:49.820]   The guardian does have to go before the court to be officially approved.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:49.820]   The guardian does have to go before the court to be officially approved.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:20:18.620]   I remember that guardianship under a will is not guaranteed to be carried out.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.080]   It's going to be carried out.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.180]   It's likely going to be carried out but the judge always has the final say in establishing the guardianship of your children.
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:19.620]   But then your trust is established it gets funded your co-trusties then can manage the money and take care of your children for you.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.720]   That answer your question?
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.100]   And anything unclear you want to ask any follow-up question?
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:25.480]   That answer your question? And anything unclear you want to ask any follow-up question?
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:25.980]   That answer your question? And anything unclear you want to ask any follow-up question?
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.000]   That's great. That's great. That's very helpful.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.700]   Would there be, I know you've got the palette in your registry.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.980]   Would you have something that close it like that for law and lawyers, attorneys, something like that?
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.100]   I would really love to have it but I don't.
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.900]   Here's what I would do.
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.160]   I would love to have something like that but again I don't.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:44.940]   Here's what I do.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:49.420]   So the best way I know of to cut through the law and lawyers, attorneys, something like that.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:49.420]   Here's what I would do.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:49.420]   I would love to have something like that but again I don't.

And here there are legal implications, there are tax implications, and there are practical implications. The practical implications, in my experience, are probably, you know, some of the biggest, some of the biggest things that, that happen. Most people want to just have a policy on their life, and they want to be able to sign the paperwork for the policies on their life.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:47.600]   And so when I was in, when I was sold life insurance, most people would just choose to buy a policy on their life and make their spouse a beneficiary, because it was simple, it was easy. You could sign your own papers. Sometimes, if I always met with one spouse or the other, that person would be the owner of all the policies. So, as an example, I own the policies, yes, I own the policies on our children's lives with my, between my wife and me. And I do that just because I'm a parent.

[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.680]   underinsured with regard to life insurance. So for most people, if they would just go and get a
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.860]   10 year level term life insurance policy of a million bucks, it would be wonderful. That would

One company may look at somebody who has slightly high cholesterol and that automatically bumps them from the super preferred down to the preferred. Another company may use what's referred to as a point system where yes, you have a high cholesterol and that's a minus one point, but you also have a great family history. Your parents died at old ages, so that's a plus two points. And so we'll go ahead and keep you in the preferred or the super preferred rating.

One company may look at somebody who has slightly higher cholesterol and that ultimately bumps them from the super preferred down to the super preferred rating. Some companies would have say 15% of their applicants be approved for super preferred ratings. Some companies would have 40% of their applicants, maybe that's a little high 30% of their applicants approved at a super preferred rating. And then you get down to the integration of tobacco and other other lifestyle avocations. The race cars, you scuba dive, etc. That put come into play. So the best thing to do in my opinion is
