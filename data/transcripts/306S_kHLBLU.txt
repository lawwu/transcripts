[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.080]   - Sometimes we talk books on this podcast like today.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.120]   I love this question from Aaron Flanagan
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.020]   who writes in to ask this.
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.360]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.800]   I know you have spent much of your life studying Romans.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.080]   That's no joke.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.240]   Which commentaries have proven most helpful to you
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.000]   exegetically and devotionally?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.480]   - It is true.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.680]   I have spent a large part of my life,
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.480]   I was thinking about this
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.040]   when I heard the question,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.920]   a large part of my life thinking about the book of Romans.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.880]   When I was a pastor,
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.000]   I waited almost 20 years to preach on Romans
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   because I felt like I needed to have a capital of trust
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.280]   in my people if I was gonna venture
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.800]   to hold their attention for eight years on one book.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.000]   I'd say, "Oh no, this is gonna be boring."
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.840]   And so we were, we were in Romans for eight years.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.000]   I think there are 250 or so sermons there.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.280]   And the aim of all that attention to Romans
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.880]   has been to think Paul's thoughts after him
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.960]   and feel Paul's passions with him.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.640]   And in that way, come into communication with the God
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.720]   who inspired Paul to write what he wrote
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.760]   and feel what he felt.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.480]   And in that way, to come to appreciate and reverence
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.480]   and admire and enjoy and celebrate and trust
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.360]   and obey and herald the mind of God
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.760]   as he reveals himself in the book of Romans.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.280]   So yes, I have, and I don't regret it.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.360]   And I would encourage anybody to give themselves
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.320]   long and hard to this book.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.680]   The first thing I need to say in relation to commentaries,
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.520]   as you might expect me to say,
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.560]   is that it is 10 times more important than a reader,
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.640]   a pastor, teacher, parent, anybody,
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.920]   look and look and look and look and look
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.640]   at the book for themselves
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.280]   or at the paragraph for themselves
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.080]   before they become dependent on any commentary.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.960]   If you default to a commentary too quickly,
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.960]   it will deaden your capacity to see things for yourself.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.600]   And I think the best writers of commentaries
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.760]   would agree with me on that.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.760]   If you want to see things and savor things
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.560]   and say things with depth and joy
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.760]   and authenticity and authority and power,
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.560]   you need to see them for yourself.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.560]   People can tell when you're a second-hander.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   They really can.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.200]   A second-hander is a person who depends on other people
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.240]   that see what needs to be seen and savored and said
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.320]   and you're dependent and they can tell you're dependent.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.240]   You never have the same sense of wonder and joy
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.720]   and authority and authenticity
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.000]   when delivering what somebody else saw
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.280]   rather than what you saw.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.120]   So my first note to strike is a note of warning
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   against the use of commentaries or Piper sermons,
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.320]   God forbid, online as substitutes for staring at the text
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.000]   until you see what glories are there.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.480]   Okay, there's the warning.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.720]   Now here's the answer to the question.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.520]   What commentaries did I find most useful?
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.440]   Because I did, I consulted commentaries often.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.520]   Not every Sunday because I didn't have time some Sundays
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.640]   and some Sundays it just exploded so much on its own
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.280]   that I didn't feel like I needed to, but I did regularly.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.200]   Here they are.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.080]   First, of all the commentaries,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.560]   of all the books of the New Testament,
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.600]   the one that I come back to most often
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.920]   is Henry Alford, the Greek New Testament.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.000]   Henry Alford died in the 1870s, I think,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.760]   and wrote a commentary on all the books
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.440]   of the New Testament based on the Greek
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.080]   and I find him most helpful not because of his theology
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.480]   but because of his relentless attention
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.280]   to grammatical and logical detail.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.280]   He tends to wrestle with the things that I understand least
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.440]   and that's where I need help.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.080]   It seems to me that most commentaries are 90% obvious,
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.960]   like you're reading there what you would have seen
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.120]   on your own.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.220]   It's the 10% we need help with
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.400]   and Alford regularly is helpful.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.320]   Number two, Tom Shriner on Romans was probably the next one
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.300]   of all the modern commentaries that I consulted
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.800]   or historic for that matter.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   Tom and I think the same way about tracing the flow
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.640]   of an author's thought and therefore,
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.160]   he regularly was addressing the very things
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.320]   I was struggling with when it comes to
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.320]   how to put Paul's thoughts together in a logical flow.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.600]   Third, John Stott on Romans.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.120]   This is a popular commentary,
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.240]   not a detailed one based on Greek,
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.240]   but Stott has an amazing gift for seeing patterns
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.160]   and putting thoughts together from the text
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.640]   in an organized way, often an alliterative way.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.560]   There's a genius and a gifting that he has
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.200]   that proved illuminating over and over again.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.040]   What is it?
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.840]   Fourth, C.E.B. Cranfield's commentary in the ICC series.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.800]   The second volume of Cranfield's commentary
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.400]   was published the year before I became a pastor, 1979.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.600]   And I consulted Cranfield repeatedly
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.840]   as one of the more solid, balanced representatives
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.360]   of mainline critical scholarship.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.420]   He's British, was British.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.680]   I find that the way the ICC commentary is laid out
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.280]   on the page with the Greek is very, very helpful.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.560]   And Cranfield's judgments were in general
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.440]   really worth considering.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.480]   The evangelical commentary that would be of comparable scope
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.420]   would be Douglas Moo.
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.420]   And so Moo is the go-to place of evangelical commentators,
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.280]   it seems to me, for the fullest grappling
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.760]   with issues from various angles.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.120]   And the last one I'll mention,
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.480]   even though in one sense it stands out as foremost,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.920]   is John Murray.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.200]   Murray was a systematic theologian at Westminster,
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.600]   but like Charles Hodge,
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.200]   he wrote an absolutely amazing commentary on Romans.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.640]   In one sense, I don't think any commentary
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.960]   has surpassed Murray in theological depth and precision
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.480]   on the book of Romans.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.880]   The sentences are complex and carefully crafted,
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.160]   and they are penetrating in the depth
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.280]   and scope of their theological richness.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.200]   So those are the six that I consulted,
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.360]   I think, most often, lest I'm forgetting something.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.240]   And I have about 13 others on my shelf,
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.120]   but when you're under pressure as a pastor,
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.460]   you tend to just stick with your most fruitful buddies.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.400]   And those were the ones that were stacked up on my desk
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.520]   for years and years.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.720]   But let me close, say one more time,
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.880]   that if you don't own a single commentary on Romans,
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.200]   you are not at a loss.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.360]   You have your Bible,
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.200]   the most precious book in the universe.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.000]   If you read it carefully and slowly brood
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.040]   over what it says with prayer and humility,
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.960]   the book of Romans will open itself to you gloriously.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.240]   If you look and look and look at the book,
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.880]   the treasures you will find on your own
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.360]   with God's help in humility and prayer
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.760]   and vigorous attention to what's there
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.680]   will be worth every hour.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.240]   - Amen.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.920]   I'm so curious about how many hours of your life
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.000]   you've spent studying the text of Romans itself.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.280]   Do you have any idea of how many hours that is?
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.240]   - Well, I'd have to do the arithmetic, Tony, I don't know.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.400]   Take eight years and let's see,
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   250 sermons times maybe average of 10 hours
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.080]   to prepare for each one.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.280]   And then goodness gracious, I wrote a book on Romans,
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.520]   The Justification of God, Romans 9, 1 to 23.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.760]   That took, goodness, a year of focused attention.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.200]   I've preached scads of other sermons on Romans
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.780]   besides that series.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.440]   I've taught Sunday school lessons on Romans.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.000]   I've done blog posts on Romans.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.680]   I've done look at the books and APJs
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.920]   with the help of Romans.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.720]   So I would have to go back and do the math,
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.960]   but it's a big hunk of my life.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.320]   - My word, yes, it has been.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.120]   Thank you, Pastor John, for these recommendations
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.340]   and thank you for the model of your life here as well.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.960]   That book that was just mentioned
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.960]   and all those Romans sermons, 250 or so,
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.100]   are all on the site right now, DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.420]   I should say, listening to the entire series
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.500]   of Romans sermons is something of a John Piper pilgrimage
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.780]   that I know a number of DG friends have pulled off,
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.800]   listeners of this podcast included.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.000]   It's quite a feat, but it's realistic and it can be done.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.960]   All right, but enough talk about books, about Romans.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.500]   We need to dive in and address Romans 8 tomorrow
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.800]   and a question about what is the difference
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.680]   between the called and the chosen?
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.720]   How do we distinguish those two groups
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.720]   or are the called and the chosen
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.580]   really one group to begin with?
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.420]   That's tomorrow.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.920]   I am your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.720]   Thanks for making the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.280]   a part of your daily routine.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.440]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
