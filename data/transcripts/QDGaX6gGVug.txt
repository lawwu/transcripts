[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.480]   - Podcast listener named Paul Kilpatrick
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.920]   writes in to ask this.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.920]   Seriously, what would you do in a zombie apocalypse?
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.080]   Yes, Paul, very good question.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.520]   We want to be prepared.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.640]   We must be prepared.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.720]   And for answers, we turn to zombie expert
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.460]   and associate professor of Old Testament
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.040]   at Briarcrest College and Seminary in Saskatchewan,
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.440]   Dr. Eric Ortlund.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.880]   Eric, thank you for joining us on such short notice
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.640]   to answer this urgent question.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.640]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.840]   Thank you for having me.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.760]   - So let's dive in.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.680]   Of course, it's futile to try and prevent
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.600]   a zombie apocalypse.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.120]   It will come upon us and with little warning.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.280]   So how do we prepare for and survive a zombie apocalypse?
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.240]   - Yeah, I think it's really just two things,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.720]   a samurai sword and lots and lots of protein bars.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.520]   That's pretty much all you need.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520]   And a fresh source of water and a lot of friends,
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.600]   but really it's just samurai sword and protein bars.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.680]   That's it and you're set.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.080]   You get your sword out and you get a protein bar ready
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.600]   just so you have enough energy to keep swinging.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.640]   That's it, that's my advice.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.320]   - Yeah, so it's really about endurance
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.160]   and it's about getting to a rural area, right?
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.320]   - Yes, that's right.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.640]   Or just head north.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.040]   Most zombies don't wear clothes.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.920]   They'll freeze eventually, though.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.760]   - Of course, yeah.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.000]   And that's why you live in Saskatchewan.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.560]   - Basically, yeah, because I'm absolutely convinced
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.120]   the zombie apocalypse is coming soon,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.280]   but I'm gonna be safe up here.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.280]   I just need to find enough wood to burn.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.960]   - Okay, that was a real question from Paul
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.480]   in the APJ inbox, by the way.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.680]   A little bit disturbing, but it is real.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.000]   So Eric, you are the world's leading expert
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.440]   on the theology of the zombie apocalypse,
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.600]   or at least you're the closest I could find.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.560]   And that's because you published a zombie novel
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.000]   in 2013 titled Dead Petals, an Apocalypse.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.840]   So seriously now, what drew you
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.520]   to the zombie apocalypse genre?
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.440]   - Well, there were two things, really.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.560]   The first was, maybe I can admit this on the air,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.920]   I actually do kind of like zombie movies.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.440]   First of all, because there are a number of reasons,
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.400]   but the main reason is they have a very low anthropology.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.240]   Zombie movies seem to be asking,
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.680]   if the normal constraints of society are pulled away,
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.680]   how will human beings act?
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.600]   And for the most part, the answer is
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.880]   we will be horribly selfish and monstrous to each other.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.960]   So whenever I see a non-Christian,
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.920]   even if they're asking the question in a silly way,
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.680]   if they're asking a serious question
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.720]   and giving a thoughtful answer,
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.800]   I always wanna pay attention to that and respect that.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.000]   Having said that, I think the idea of the zombie apocalypse,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.360]   even though it's just so silly and ludicrous, of course,
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.240]   I can't help but think of what Paul says in Ephesians 2
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.840]   about us being dead in trespasses and sin.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.040]   I can't help but wonder if there isn't a real insight
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.960]   in those movies.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.320]   I have to ask why, there was a movie
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.360]   before the 1953 George Romero classic,
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.760]   but no one really remembers it.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.360]   But it's been, I don't know, 50 years or so,
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.840]   and the genre is still going strong.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.200]   So why are these kinds of movies still around?
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   Why, how do they speak to us?
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.880]   And I can't help but wonder if in a zombie movie,
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.240]   the reader is identifying both with the monster
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.040]   and with the survivors.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.560]   I can't help but wonder if at some level,
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.200]   a zombie movie is an attempt to recognize
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.800]   what is monstrous about oneself.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.720]   If they're trying to recognize themselves in the monster
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.240]   and at some level trying to say, I am dead inside,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.240]   I move around and I eat, but I'm dead inside, I'm not alive.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.760]   I'm an endlessly hungry dead thing.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   And at the same time, I wonder if viewers are trying
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.680]   to identify with their survivors and ask,
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.160]   can I survive my own monstrosity?
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.360]   And for the most part in zombie movies, the answer is no.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.720]   For the most part, they end tragically
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.520]   and all the human survivors die.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.200]   And you know, something inside me really likes that.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.600]   I appreciate the fact that they have such gloomy endings.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.080]   So I teach Old Testament and in the Old Testament,
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.400]   if you studied in the context of the ancient Middle East,
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.840]   they're rebelling against their cultural context
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.800]   in all kinds of ways.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.160]   Just the fact that you can't have idol statues,
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.400]   that was hugely counter-cultural.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.200]   And yet God is using the genres and the forms of speech
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.920]   that are common in the ancient Middle East
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.440]   to speak to his people in a way that makes sense to them.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.720]   He's speaking their cultural language.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.040]   Often he is hijacking genres to say,
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.880]   listen, the other gods out there, they're not the real God,
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.040]   I'm the real God.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.840]   So it got me thinking, okay,
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.280]   if this is a theologically significant genre,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.360]   is there a way I can hijack it to talk about the real God?
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.960]   And then the novel started writing itself, so.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.840]   - So what would you want readers
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.960]   to take away from "Dead Petals"?
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.200]   - It really is an apocalypse.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.040]   It's about the transformation of reality.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.840]   It's about the end, the absolute end of normal reality
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.200]   and the breaking in of a whole new reality.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.720]   But our only access to that
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.840]   is through a death and a resurrection.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.360]   If Christians could read it and get a sense of the enormity
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.640]   and even the violence of apocalypse,
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.160]   and I'm using the word apocalypse
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.720]   in the biblical sense when I say that,
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.800]   then I'd be happy.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.480]   I'd be so much happier.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.200]   I'd be just thrilled if a non-Christian
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.680]   who likes zombie novels would pick it up and read it,
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.520]   have no idea what they're getting into
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.680]   and start asking some pretty deep questions as,
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.200]   start asking the right questions after reading it.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.160]   The book is intended to be mythic
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.800]   in the best sense of that word,
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.040]   in the sense of talking about gigantic realities
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.720]   that are hard to talk about reality
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.640]   except symbolizing them.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.600]   I find that kind of literature,
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.240]   and I get criticized sometimes
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.520]   for talking about C.S. Lewis and Tolkien so much,
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.960]   but they did do that kind of thing so, so, so, so well.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.640]   So I'm trying to do that as well.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.320]   So I don't suppose this needs to be said
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.240]   about a zombie novel,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.640]   but people looking for realistic fiction,
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.840]   I'm gonna try to be as weird as I can get away with it.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.280]   - Wonderful.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.040]   That's Eric Ortlund, author of the novel
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.400]   "Dead Petals and Apocalypse" available right now
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.960]   at amazon.com.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.160]   On the phone from zombie-free safe zone Saskatchewan.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.360]   Thank you, Eric.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.000]   - Thanks very much for having me.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.360]   (silence)
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.520]   (silence)
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.680]   (silence)
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.740]   you
