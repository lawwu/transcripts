[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   The following is a conversation with Gilbert Strang.
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.760]   He's a professor of mathematics at MIT
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.480]   and perhaps one of the most famous
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.600]   and impactful teachers of math in the world.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.640]   His MIT OpenCourseWare lectures on linear algebra
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.920]   have been viewed millions of times.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.480]   As an undergraduate student,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.960]   I was one of those millions of students.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.760]   There's something inspiring about the way he teaches.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.120]   There's at once calm, simple, and yet full of passion
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.080]   for the elegance inherent to mathematics.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.200]   I remember doing the exercise in his book,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.000]   Introduction to Linear Algebra,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.880]   and slowly realizing that the world of matrices,
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.360]   of vector spaces, of determinants and eigenvalues,
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.040]   of geometric transformations and matrix decompositions
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.120]   reveal a set of powerful tools
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.920]   in the toolbox of artificial intelligence.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.080]   From signals to images, from numerical optimization
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.640]   to robotics, computer vision, deep learning,
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.600]   computer graphics, and everywhere outside AI,
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.040]   including, of course, a quantum mechanical study
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.520]   of our universe.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.440]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.800]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.840]   give it five stars on Apple Podcast,
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.360]   support on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter,
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.480]   @LexFriedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.040]   This podcast is supported by ZipRecruiter.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.200]   Hiring great people is hard,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.240]   and to me is the most important element
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.040]   of a successful mission-driven team.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.080]   I've been fortunate to be a part of
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.680]   and to lead several great engineering teams.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.640]   The hiring I've done in the past
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.360]   was mostly through tools that we built ourselves,
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.360]   but reinventing the wheel was painful.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.160]   ZipRecruiter is a tool that's already available for you.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.960]   It seeks to make hiring simple, fast, and smart.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.920]   For example, Codable co-founder Gretchen Huebner
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.320]   used ZipRecruiter to find a new game artist
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.640]   to join her education tech company.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.800]   By using ZipRecruiter screening questions
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.240]   to filter candidates,
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.040]   Gretchen found it easier to focus on the best candidates,
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.400]   and finally hiring the perfect person for the role
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   in less than two weeks from start to finish.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.520]   ZipRecruiter, the smartest way to hire.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.160]   See why ZipRecruiter is effective
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.640]   for businesses of all sizes by signing up,
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.560]   as I did, for free at ZipRecruiter.com/lexpod.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.320]   That's ZipRecruiter.com/lexpod.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.320]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.840]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.600]   I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.040]   but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.840]   Most Bitcoin exchanges take days
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.080]   for a bank transfer to become investable.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.440]   Through Cash App, it takes seconds.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.800]   Cash App also has a new investing feature.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.560]   You can buy fractions of a stock,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.280]   which to me is a really interesting concept.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.560]   So you can buy $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.520]   Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.280]   a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.080]   I'm excited to be working with Cash App
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.760]   to support one of my favorite organizations
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.720]   that many of you may know and have benefited from,
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.160]   called FIRST, best known for their FIRST Robotics
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.840]   and LEGO competitions.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.520]   They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.520]   in over 110 countries,
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.960]   and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.560]   which means the donated money is used
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.920]   to maximum effectiveness.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.920]   When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.400]   and use code LEXPODCAST,
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.200]   you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.160]   which again is an organization
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.960]   that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.960]   to dream of engineering a better world.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.720]   And now, here's my conversation with Gilbert Strang.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.440]   How does it feel to be one of the modern day rock stars
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.720]   of mathematics?
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.840]   - I don't feel like a rock star.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.280]   That's kind of crazy for an old math person,
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.280]   but it's true that the videos in linear algebra
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.140]   that I made way back in 2000, I think,
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.840]   have been watched a lot.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.400]   And well, partly the importance of linear algebra,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.720]   which I'm sure you'll ask me and give me a chance to say
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.080]   that linear algebra as a subject
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.600]   has just surged in importance.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.480]   But also, it was a class that I taught a bunch of times,
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.480]   so I kind of got it organized and enjoyed doing it.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.200]   The videos were just the class.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   So they're on OpenCourseWare and on YouTube and translated.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.040]   That's fun.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.120]   - But there's something about that chalkboard
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.480]   and the simplicity of the way you explain
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.800]   the basic concepts in the beginning.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.440]   To be honest, when I went to undergrad--
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.640]   - You didn't do linear algebra, probably.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.400]   - Of course I didn't do linear algebra.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.440]   But before going through the course at my university,
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.520]   I was going through OpenCourseWare.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.640]   You were my instructor for linear algebra.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.480]   - Oh, I see, right, yeah.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.560]   - And that, I mean, we were using your book.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.560]   And I mean, the fact that there's thousands,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.000]   you know, hundreds of thousands,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.880]   millions of people that watch that video,
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.240]   I think that's really powerful.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.240]   So how do you think the idea of putting lectures online,
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.280]   what really MIT OpenCourseWare has innovated?
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.720]   - That was a wonderful idea.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.720]   You know, I think the story that I've heard
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.720]   is the committee was appointed by the president,
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.000]   President Vest at that time, a wonderful guy.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.440]   And the idea of the committee was to figure out
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.440]   how MIT could be like other universities,
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.560]   market the work we were doing.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.680]   And then they didn't see a way, and after a weekend,
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.240]   and they had an inspiration,
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.960]   came back to President Vest and said,
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.240]   what if we just gave it away?
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.240]   And he decided that was okay, good idea.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.520]   So--
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.640]   - You know, that's a crazy idea.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.040]   That's, if we think of a university
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.040]   as a thing that creates a product, isn't knowledge,
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.880]   - Right.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.580]   - The, you know, the kind of educational knowledge
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.680]   isn't the product, and giving that away,
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.120]   are you surprised that it went through?
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.520]   - The result that he did it, well,
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.760]   knowing a little bit President Vest,
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.000]   it was like him, I think.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.100]   And it was really the right idea, you know.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.200]   MIT is a kind of, it's known for being high level,
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   technical things, and this is the best way we can say,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.600]   tell, we can show what MIT really is like.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.380]   'Cause in my case, those 1806 videos
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.960]   are just teaching the class.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.680]   They were there in 26-100.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.880]   They're kind of fun to look at.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.300]   People write to me and say, oh, you've got a sense of humor,
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.920]   but I don't know where that comes through.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.720]   Somehow I've been friendly with the class,
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.720]   I like students, and linear algebra,
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.600]   we gotta give the subject most of the credit.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.840]   It really has come forward in importance in these years.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.740]   - So let's talk about linear algebra a little bit,
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.620]   'cause it is such a, it's both a powerful
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.100]   and a beautiful subfield of mathematics.
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.100]   So what's your favorite specific topic in linear algebra,
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.620]   or even math in general, to give a lecture on,
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.220]   to convey, to tell a story, to teach students?
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.480]   - Okay, well, on the teaching side,
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.800]   so it's not deep mathematics at all,
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   but I'm kind of proud of the idea of the four subspaces,
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.200]   the four fundamental subspaces,
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.640]   which are, of course, known before,
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.680]   long before my name for them, but--
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.680]   - Can you go through them?
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.520]   Can you go through the four subspaces?
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.040]   - Sure I can, yeah.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.640]   So the first one to understand is,
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.920]   so the matrix, maybe I should say the matrix--
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.760]   - What is a matrix?
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.880]   - What's a matrix?
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.480]   Well, so we have like a rectangle of numbers.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.240]   So it's got N columns, got a bunch of columns,
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.500]   and also got an M rows, let's say,
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.560]   and the relation between, so of course,
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.600]   the columns and the rows, it's the same numbers,
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.320]   so there's gotta be connections there,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.760]   but they're not simple.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.080]   The columns might be longer than the rows,
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.720]   and they're all different, the numbers are mixed up.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.760]   First space to think about is, take the columns,
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.880]   so those are vectors, those are points in N dimensions.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.720]   - What's a vector?
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.680]   - So a physicist would imagine a vector,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   or might imagine a vector as a arrow in space,
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.840]   or the point it ends at in space.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.280]   For me, it's a column of numbers.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.960]   - You often think of, this is very interesting
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.960]   in terms of linear algebra, in terms of a vector,
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.680]   you think a little bit more abstract
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.600]   than how it's very commonly used, perhaps.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.720]   You think this arbitrary space, multi-dimensional space--
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.240]   - Right away, I'm in high dimensions.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.080]   - Dreamland.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.440]   - Yeah, that's right, in the lecture, I try to,
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.760]   so if you think of two vectors in 10 dimensions,
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.440]   I'll do this in class, and I'll readily admit
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.360]   that I have no good image in my mind
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.260]   of a vector, of a arrow in 10-dimensional space,
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.260]   but whatever, you can add one bunch of 10 numbers
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.320]   to another bunch of 10 numbers,
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.080]   so you can add a vector to a vector,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.320]   and you can multiply a vector by three,
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.160]   and that's, if you know how to do those,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.080]   you've got linear algebra.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.120]   - You know, 10 dimensions, there's this beautiful thing
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.240]   about math, if we look at string theory,
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.840]   and all these theories which are really fundamentally
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.960]   derived through math, but are very difficult to visualize,
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.880]   and how do you think about the things,
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.120]   like a 10-dimensional vector,
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.020]   that we can't really visualize?
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:38.320]   And yet, math reveals some beauty--
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.160]   - Oh, great beauty.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.040]   - To define our world in that weird thing
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.000]   we can't visualize, how do you think about that difference?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.880]   - Well, probably, I'm not a very geometric person,
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.680]   so I'm probably thinking in three dimensions,
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.960]   and the beauty of linear algebra is that
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.160]   it goes on to 10 dimensions with no problem.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.200]   I mean, if you're just seeing what happens
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.600]   if you add two vectors in 3D,
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.440]   yeah, then you can add them in 10D,
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.880]   you're just adding the 10 components.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.840]   So I can't say that I have a picture,
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.320]   but yet I try to push the class to think
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.200]   of a flat surface in 10 dimensions,
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.440]   so a plane in 10 dimensions,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.180]   and so that's one of the spaces.
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.880]   Take all the columns of the matrix,
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.800]   take all their combinations,
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.180]   so much of this column, so much of this one,
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.800]   then if you put all those together,
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.920]   you get some kind of a flat surface
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.680]   that I call a vector space, space of vectors,
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.260]   and my imagination is just seeing
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.240]   like a piece of paper in 3D.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.600]   But anyway, so that's one of the spaces,
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.480]   that's space number one, the column space of the matrix.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.040]   And then there's the row space,
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.160]   which is, as I said, different,
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.760]   but came from the same numbers.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.080]   So we got the column space,
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.040]   all combinations of the columns,
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.960]   and then we got the row space,
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.560]   all combinations of the rows.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.520]   So those words are easy for me to say,
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.240]   and I can't really draw them on a blackboard,
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.520]   but I try with my thick chalk.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.880]   Everybody likes that railroad chalk,
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.960]   and me too, I wouldn't use anything else now.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.800]   - Yeah.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.040]   - And then the other two spaces are perpendicular to those.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.080]   So like if you have a plane in 3D,
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.520]   just a plane is just a flat surface in 3D,
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.060]   then perpendicular to that plane would be a line,
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.200]   so that would be the null space.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.000]   So we've got two, we've got a column space, a row space,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.920]   and there are two perpendicular spaces.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.760]   So those four fit together
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.760]   in a beautiful picture of a matrix, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.720]   It's sort of a fundamental, it's not a difficult idea.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.720]   It comes pretty early in 1806, and it's basic.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.360]   - So planes in these multidimensional spaces,
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.140]   how difficult of an idea is that to come to, do you think?
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.640]   If you look back in time,
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.800]   I think mathematically it makes sense,
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.600]   but I don't know if it's intuitive for us to imagine,
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.120]   just as we were talking about.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.800]   It feels like calculus is easier to intuit.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.400]   - Well, I have to admit, calculus came earlier,
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.860]   earlier than linear algebra.
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.200]   So Newton and Leibniz were the great men
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.820]   to understand the key ideas of calculus.
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.520]   But linear algebra, to me, is like,
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.640]   okay, it's the starting point,
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.160]   'cause it's all about flat things.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   Calculus has got all the complications of calculus
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   come from the curves, the bending, the curved surfaces.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.900]   Linear algebra, the surfaces are all flat.
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.040]   Nothing bends in linear algebra.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.660]   So it should have come first, but it didn't.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.660]   And calculus also comes first in high school classes,
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.880]   in college class, it'll be freshman math,
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.360]   it'll be calculus, and then I say, enough of it.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.520]   Like, okay, get to the good stuff.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.920]   - Do you think linear algebra should come first?
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.700]   - Well, it really, I'm okay with it not coming first,
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.120]   but it should, yeah, it should.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.080]   It's simpler.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.160]   - 'Cause everything is flat.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.640]   - Yeah, everything's flat.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.560]   Well, of course, for that reason,
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.600]   calculus sort of sticks to one dimension,
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.480]   or eventually you do multivariate,
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.240]   but that basically means two dimensions.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.560]   Linear algebra, you take off into 10 dimensions, no problem.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.640]   - It just feels scary and dangerous
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.800]   to go beyond two dimensions, that's all.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.120]   (both laughing)
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.700]   - If everything's flat, you can't go wrong.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.280]   - So what concept or theorem in linear algebra,
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.700]   or in math, you find most beautiful,
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.420]   that gives you pause, that leaves you in awe?
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.080]   - Well, I'll stick with linear algebra here.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.680]   I hope the viewer knows that really,
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.400]   mathematics is amazing, amazing subject,
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   and deep, deep connections between ideas
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.620]   that didn't look connected, they turned out they were.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.600]   But if we stick with linear algebra,
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.800]   so we have a matrix, that's like the basic thing,
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.680]   a rectangle of numbers, and it might be a rectangle of data.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.760]   You're probably gonna ask me later about data science,
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.400]   where often data comes in a matrix.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:55.400]   You have, maybe every column corresponds to a drug,
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.360]   and every row corresponds to a patient,
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:05.360]   and if the patient reacted favorably to the drug,
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.180]   then you put up some positive number in there.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:14.180]   Anyway, rectangle of numbers, a matrix is basic.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.200]   So the big problem is to understand all those numbers.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.000]   You got a big, big set of numbers,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.640]   and what are the patterns, what's going on?
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.640]   And so one of the ways to break down
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.680]   that matrix into simple pieces
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.120]   is uses something called singular values,
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:42.120]   and that's come on as fundamental in the last,
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.520]   and certainly in my lifetime.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.560]   Eigenvalues, if you have viewers
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.560]   who've done engineering math or basic linear algebra,
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.120]   eigenvalues were in there,
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.160]   but those are restricted to square matrices,
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.720]   and data comes in rectangular matrices,
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   so you gotta take that next step.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.720]   I'm always pushing math faculty, get on, do it, do it,
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.120]   do it, singular values.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.720]   So those are a way to break,
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:22.720]   to find the important pieces of the matrix,
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.840]   which add up to the whole matrix.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.040]   So you're breaking a matrix into simple pieces,
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.240]   and the first piece is the most important part of the data,
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.120]   the second piece is the second most important part,
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.600]   and then often, so a data scientist will,
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.800]   like if a data scientist can find
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.840]   those first and second pieces, stop there.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.840]   The rest of the data is probably round off,
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.640]   experimental error maybe,
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.160]   so you're looking for the important part.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.000]   - So what do you find beautiful about singular values?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.280]   - Well, yeah, I didn't give the theorem,
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.400]   so here's the idea of singular values.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   Every matrix, every matrix, rectangular, square, whatever,
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.000]   can be written as a product
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.040]   of three very simple special matrices,
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.320]   so that's the theorem.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:26.240]   Every matrix can be written as a rotation times a stretch,
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.320]   which is just a matrix, a diagonal matrix,
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.200]   otherwise all zeros except on the one diagonal,
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.000]   and then the third factor is another rotation.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   So rotation, stretch, rotation is the breakup of any matrix.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.440]   - The structure of that, the ability that you can do that,
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.840]   what do you find appealing?
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.040]   What do you find beautiful about it?
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.240]   - Well, geometrically, as I freely admit,
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.240]   the action of a matrix is not so easy to visualize,
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.360]   but everybody can visualize a rotation.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:07.040]   Take two-dimensional space and just turn it
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.240]   around the center.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.720]   Take three-dimensional space,
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.200]   so a pilot has to know about, well, what are the three,
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.400]   the yaw is one of them, I've forgotten all the three turns
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.740]   that a pilot makes.
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.400]   Up to 10 dimensions, you've got 10 ways to turn,
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.500]   but you can visualize a rotation.
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.080]   Take the space and turn it, and you can visualize a stretch.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:37.080]   So to break a matrix with all those numbers in it
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.080]   into something you can visualize,
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.840]   rotate, stretch, rotate, is pretty neat.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.760]   - Yeah. - Pretty neat.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.660]   - That's pretty powerful.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.000]   On YouTube, just consuming a bunch of videos
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   and just watching what people connect with
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.320]   and what they really enjoy and are inspired by,
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.580]   math seems to come up again and again.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.960]   I'm trying to understand why that is.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.480]   Perhaps you can help give me clues.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.760]   So it's not just the kinds of lectures that you give,
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.160]   but it's also just other folks, like with Numberphile,
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.940]   there's a channel where they just chat about things
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.880]   that are extremely complicated, actually.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.920]   People nevertheless connect with them.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.560]   What do you think that is?
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.800]   - It's wonderful, isn't it?
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.480]   I mean, I wasn't really aware of it.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:33.480]   We're conditioned to think math is hard, math is abstract,
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.600]   math is just for a few people, but it isn't that way.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:41.400]   A lot of people quite like math, and they like to,
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.800]   I get messages from people saying,
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.800]   you know, now I'm retired, I'm gonna learn some more math.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.960]   I get a lot of those.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.920]   It's really encouraging.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.080]   And I think what people like is that there's some order,
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.440]   you know, a lot of order,
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.600]   or things are not obvious, but they're true.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:05.400]   So it's really cheering to think that so many people
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.960]   really wanna learn more about math, yeah.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.880]   - In terms of truth, again,
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.520]   sorry to slide into philosophy at times,
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.520]   but math does reveal pretty strongly what things are true.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.360]   I mean, that's the whole point of proving things.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:29.360]   And yet, sort of our real world is messy and complicated.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.240]   What do you think about the nature of truth
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.680]   that math reveals?
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.520]   - Oh, wow.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.000]   - Because it is a source of comfort, like you've mentioned.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.560]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.040]   Well, I have to say, I'm not much of a philosopher.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.880]   I just like numbers, you know, as a kid.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:52.160]   This was before you had to go in,
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.040]   when you had a filly in your teeth,
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.080]   you had to kind of just take it.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.040]   So what I did was think about math,
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.120]   you know, like take powers of two, two, four, eight, 16,
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.960]   up until the time the tooth stopped hurting
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.720]   and the dentist said you're through.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.800]   Or counting, yeah.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.840]   - So that was a source of peace, almost.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:19.760]   What is it about math, do you think, that brings that?
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.960]   What is that?
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.920]   - Well, you know where you are, yeah.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.880]   It's symmetry, it's certainty.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.880]   The fact that, you know, if you multiply two by itself
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.280]   10 times, you get 1,024, period.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.960]   Everybody's gonna get that.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.120]   - Do you see math as a powerful tool or as an art form?
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.800]   - So it's both.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.480]   That's really one of the neat things.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.440]   You can be an artist and like math.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:51.000]   You can be an engineer and use math.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:51.960]   - Which are you?
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.560]   Which-- - Which am I?
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.880]   - What did you connect with most?
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.400]   - Yeah, I'm somewhere between.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.600]   I'm certainly not a artist-type, philosopher-type person.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.120]   Might sound that way this morning, but I'm not.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.480]   (both laughing)
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.720]   Yeah, I really enjoy teaching engineers
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.280]   because they go for an answer.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.280]   And yeah, so probably within the MIT math department,
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.480]   most people enjoy teaching students
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.920]   who get the abstract idea.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.920]   I'm okay with, I'm good with engineers
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.480]   who are looking for a way to find answers, yeah.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.720]   - Actually, that's an interesting question.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.360]   Do you think for teaching and in general,
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.720]   thinking about new concepts,
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.480]   do you think it's better to plug in the numbers
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.040]   or to think more abstractly?
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.640]   So looking at theorems and proving the theorems
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.240]   or actually building up a basic intuition of the theorem
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.920]   or the method, the approach,
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.960]   and then just plugging in numbers and seeing it work?
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   - Yeah, well, certainly many of us like to see examples.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.040]   First, we understand,
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.960]   it might be a pretty abstract-sounding example,
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.800]   like a three-dimensional rotation.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   How are you gonna understand a rotation in 3D or in 10D?
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:30.840]   And then some of us like to keep going with it
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.720]   to the point where you got numbers,
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.120]   where you got 10 angles, 10 axes, 10 angles.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:43.120]   But the best, the great mathematicians probably,
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.760]   I don't know if they do that
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.760]   'cause for them, an example
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.680]   would be a highly abstract thing to the rest of us.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.760]   - Right, but nevertheless,
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.560]   working in the space of examples.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.200]   - Yeah, examples. - It seems to--
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.840]   - Examples of structure.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.680]   - Our brains seem to connect with that.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.240]   - So I'm not sure if you're familiar with him,
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.280]   but Andrew Yang is a presidential candidate
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:16.840]   currently running with math in all capital letters
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   and his hats as a slogan.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.680]   - I see.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.720]   - Stands for Make America Think Hard.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.880]   - Okay, I'll vote for him.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.680]   - And his name rhymes with yours, Yang, Strang.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.400]   But he also loves math, and he comes from that world.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.520]   But he also, looking at it,
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.600]   makes me realize that math, science, and engineering
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.400]   are not really part of our politics,
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.600]   political discourse about political,
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.160]   government in general.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.480]   Why do you think that is?
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.200]   What are your thoughts on that in general?
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.760]   - Well, certainly somewhere in the system,
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.880]   we need people who are comfortable with numbers,
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.480]   comfortable with quantities.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.400]   If you say this leads to that, they see it,
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.000]   it's undeniable.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.400]   - But isn't it strange to you
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.480]   that we have almost no, I mean, I'm pretty sure
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.920]   we have no elected officials in Congress
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.720]   or obviously the president that either
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.000]   has an engineering degree or a math degree.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.160]   - Yeah, well, that's too bad.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:30.720]   A few who could make the connection,
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.560]   yeah, it would have to be people
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.840]   who understand engineering or science
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:41.840]   and at the same time can make speeches and lead, yeah.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.560]   - And inspire people.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.640]   - Inspire, yeah.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.320]   - You were, speaking of inspiration,
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.600]   the president of the Society
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.920]   for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.760]   - Oh, yes.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.960]   - It's a major organization in math, in applied math.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.560]   What do you see as a role of that society
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.880]   in our public discourse?
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.440]   - Right, yeah, so, well, it was fun to be president
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.280]   at the time.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.120]   (laughing)
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.440]   - A couple years, a few years.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.120]   - Two years, around 2000.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.840]   So, that's the president of a pretty small society,
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.640]   but nevertheless, it was a time when math
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.400]   was getting some more attention in Washington.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:29.240]   But yeah, I got to give a little 10 minutes
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:33.920]   to a committee of the House of Representatives
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.320]   talking about why math.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.000]   And then, actually, it was fun
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.800]   because one of the members of the House
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.880]   had been a student, had been in my class.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.080]   What do you think of that?
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.720]   Yeah, as you say, a pretty rare,
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.880]   most members of the House have had a different training,
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:56.360]   different background, but there was one from New Hampshire
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:01.360]   who was my friend, really, by being in the class.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.800]   Yeah, so those years were good.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.600]   Then, of course, other things take over
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.600]   in importance in Washington, and math,
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.240]   math just, at this point, is not so visible,
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.240]   but for a little moment, it was.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.780]   - There's some excitement, some concern
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.320]   about artificial intelligence in Washington now.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.480]   - Yes, sure. - About the future.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.820]   - Yeah. - And I think at the core
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.040]   of that is math.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   - Well, it is, yeah.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.280]   Maybe it's hidden, maybe it's wearing a different hat.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.760]   - Well, artificial intelligence,
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.640]   and particularly, can I use the words deep learning?
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.280]   It's a deep learning, is a particular approach
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.620]   to understanding data.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.200]   Again, you've got a big, whole lot of data
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:56.060]   where data is just swamping the computers of the world,
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:00.680]   and to understand it, out of all those numbers,
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.200]   to find what's important in climate, in everything.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.520]   And artificial intelligence is two words
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.700]   for one approach to data.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.560]   Deep learning is a specific approach there,
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.440]   which uses a lot of linear algebra.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.280]   So I got into it.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.600]   I thought, okay, I've gotta learn about this.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.120]   - So maybe from your perspective,
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.520]   let me ask the most basic question.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.580]   - Yeah. - How do you think
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.360]   of a neural network?
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.720]   What is a neural network?
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.640]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.240]   So can I start with the idea about deep learning?
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.080]   What does that mean?
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:38.900]   - Sure.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:39.920]   What is deep learning?
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.000]   - What is deep learning, yeah.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.280]   So we're trying to learn, from all this data,
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.880]   we're trying to learn what's important.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.280]   What's it telling us?
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.040]   So you've got data.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.620]   You've got some inputs for which you know the right outputs.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:02.120]   The question is, can you see the pattern there?
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.640]   Can you figure out a way for a new input,
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.200]   which we haven't seen,
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:12.200]   to understand what the output will be from that new input?
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.960]   So we've got a million inputs with their outputs.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.240]   So we're trying to create some pattern,
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.200]   some rule that'll take those inputs,
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.560]   those million training inputs, which we know about,
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.180]   to the correct million outputs.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:33.180]   And this idea of a neural net is part of the structure
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:39.820]   of our new way to create a rule.
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:45.700]   We're looking for a rule that will take these training inputs
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.460]   to the known outputs.
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.660]   And then we're gonna use that rule on new inputs
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:56.080]   that we don't know the output and see what comes.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.120]   - Linear algebra is a big part of finding that rule.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:30:59.960]   - That's right.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.860]   Linear algebra is a big part.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.520]   Not all the part.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.200]   People were leaning on matrices.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.280]   That's good, still do.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.320]   Linear is something special.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.560]   It's all about straight lines and flat planes.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:18.880]   And data isn't quite like that.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.240]   It's more complicated.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.720]   So you gotta introduce some complication.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.480]   So you have to have some function
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.480]   that's not a straight line.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.960]   And it turned out-- - Non-linear.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.640]   - Non-linear, non-linear, non-linear.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:35.880]   And it turned out that it was enough to use the function
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.360]   that's one straight line and then a different one.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.920]   Halfway, so piecewise linear.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.960]   - Piecewise linear.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.000]   - One piece has one slope, one piece,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.360]   the other piece has the second slope.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.360]   And so getting that non-linear,
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:56.720]   simple non-linearity in blew the problem open.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.000]   - That little piece makes it sufficiently complicated
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.480]   to make things interesting.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.040]   - 'Cause you're gonna use that piece
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.840]   over and over a million times.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:08.840]   So it has a fold in the graph, the graph, two pieces.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:13.720]   But when you fold something a million times,
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.880]   you've got a pretty complicated function
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.280]   that's pretty realistic.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.120]   - So that's the thing about neural networks
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.920]   is they have a lot of these.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.200]   - A lot of these, that's right.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.660]   - So why do you think neural networks,
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:34.660]   by using a, sort of formulating an objective function,
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:39.440]   very not a plain function-- - Lots of folds.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.380]   - Lots of folds of the inputs, the outputs.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:47.360]   Why do you think they work to be able to find a rule
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.840]   that we don't know is optimal,
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.360]   but is just seems to be pretty good in a lot of cases?
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.600]   What's your intuition?
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.200]   Is it surprising to you as it is to many people?
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.160]   Do you have an intuition of why this works at all?
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.340]   - Well, I'm beginning to have a better intuition.
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:08.560]   This idea of things that are piecewise linear,
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.160]   flat pieces but with folds between them.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.000]   Like think of a roof of a complicated,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.800]   infinitely complicated house or something.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   That curved, it almost curved, but every piece is flat.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.840]   That's been used by engineers.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:31.120]   That idea's been used by engineers, is used by engineers,
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.200]   big time, something called the finite element method.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.160]   If you wanna design a bridge, design a building,
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:43.160]   design an airplane, you're using this idea
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:48.880]   of piecewise flat as a good, simple,
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.400]   computable approximation.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.160]   - But you have a sense that there's a lot
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.560]   of expressive power in this kind of piecewise linear--
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.000]   - Yeah, that's-- - Combined together.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.800]   - You used the right word.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.440]   If you measure the expressivity,
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:10.360]   how complicated a thing can this piecewise flat guys express,
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:15.480]   the answer is very complicated, yeah.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.480]   - What do you think are the limits
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:22.720]   of such piecewise linear or just of neural networks,
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.160]   the expressivity of neural networks?
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.680]   - Well, you would have said a while ago
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.780]   that they're just computational limits.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.760]   A problem beyond a certain size,
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.120]   a supercomputer isn't gonna do it.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.440]   But those keep getting more powerful,
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.720]   so that limit has been moved
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.480]   to allow more and more complicated surfaces.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:52.480]   - So in terms of just mapping from inputs to outputs,
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.960]   looking at data, what do you think of,
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.560]   in the context of neural networks in general,
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.240]   data is just tensor vectors, matrices, tensors.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.080]   - Right.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:10.320]   - How do you think about learning from data?
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.800]   How much of our world can be expressed in this way?
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.560]   How useful is this process?
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.000]   I guess that's another way to ask you,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.400]   what are the limits of this approach?
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.440]   - Well, that's a good question, yeah.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.240]   So I guess the whole idea of deep learning
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.260]   is that there's something there to learn.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.520]   If the data is totally random,
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.400]   just produced by random number generators,
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:36.280]   then we're not gonna find a useful rule,
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.440]   'cause there isn't one.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.560]   So the extreme of having a rule
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.600]   is like knowing Newton's law, you know?
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.240]   If you hit a ball, it moves.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.960]   So that's where you had laws of physics.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.960]   Newton and Einstein and other great, great people
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.960]   have found those laws,
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.960]   and laws of the distribution of oil
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.920]   in an underground thing.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.920]   I mean, so engineers, petroleum engineers,
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:17.080]   understand how oil will sit in an underground basin.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.040]   So there were rules.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.720]   Now, the new idea of artificial intelligence
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.840]   is learn the rules.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.920]   Instead of figuring out the rules
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.720]   with help from Newton or Einstein,
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.640]   the computer is looking for the rules.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.880]   So that's another step.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.880]   But if there are no rules at all
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.240]   that the computer could find,
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.600]   if it's totally random data,
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.320]   well, you've got nothing.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.320]   You've got no science to discover.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.400]   - It's an automated search for the underlying rules.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.640]   - Yeah, search for the rules, yeah, exactly.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.800]   And there will be a lot of random parts,
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.880]   a lot, I'm not knocking random,
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.740]   'cause that's there.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.360]   There's a lot of randomness built in,
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.400]   but there's gotta be some basic--
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.920]   - It's almost always signal, right?
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.600]   In most-- - There's gotta be some signal,
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.760]   yeah, if it's all noise,
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.440]   then you're not gonna get anywhere.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.920]   - Well, this world around us does seem to be,
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.440]   does seem to always have a signal of some kind
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.280]   to be discovered.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.920]   - Right, that's it.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.480]   - So what excites you more?
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.880]   We just talked about a little bit of application.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.560]   What excites you more, theory
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.400]   or the application of mathematics?
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:43.400]   - Well, for myself, I'm probably a theory person.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:49.720]   I'm speaking here pretty freely about applications,
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.240]   but I'm not the person who really,
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.040]   I'm not a physicist or a chemist or a neuroscientist.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:03.080]   So for myself, I like the structure
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.480]   and the flat subspaces
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   and the relation of matrices, columns to rows.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:17.280]   That's my part in the spectrum.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:21.160]   So really, science is a big spectrum
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:25.760]   of people from asking practical questions
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.760]   and answering them using some math,
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.880]   then some math guys like myself
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.800]   who are in the middle of it,
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   and then the geniuses of math and physics and chemistry
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.360]   who are finding fundamental rules
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.360]   and then doing the really understanding nature.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.880]   That's incredible.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.000]   - At its lowest, simplest level.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.640]   Maybe just a quick and broad strokes from your perspective.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:04.760]   Where does linear algebra sit as a subfield of mathematics?
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:09.760]   What are the various subfields that you think about
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.200]   in relation to linear algebra?
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:17.200]   - So the big fields of math are algebra as a whole
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.360]   and problems like calculus and differential equations.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.360]   So that's a second, quite different field.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.800]   Then maybe geometry deserves to be thought of
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.560]   as a different field to understand the geometry
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.120]   of high dimensional surfaces.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:39.720]   So I think, am I allowed to say this here?
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.640]   I think-- - Uh-oh, calculus.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:46.240]   - This is where personal view comes in.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:51.240]   I think math, thinking about undergraduate math,
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.320]   what millions of students study,
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:59.320]   I think we overdo the calculus at the cost of the algebra,
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.720]   at the cost of linear.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.360]   - See, I have this talk titled Calculus Versus Linear Algebra.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.440]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.480]   - And you say that linear algebra wins.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.840]   So can you dig into that a little bit?
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.080]   Why does linear algebra win?
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:21.200]   - Right, well, okay, the viewer is gonna think
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.760]   this guy is biased.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:27.080]   Not true, I'm just telling the truth as it is.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:31.920]   Yeah, so I feel linear algebra is just a nice part of math
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.420]   that people can get the idea of.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.760]   They can understand something that's a little bit abstract
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.740]   'cause once you get to 10 or 100 dimensions.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.400]   And very, very, very useful.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.840]   That's what's happened in my lifetime
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.520]   is the importance of data,
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.680]   which does come in matrix form,
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.680]   so it's really set up for algebra.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.280]   It's not set up for differential equation.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.320]   And let me fairly add probability,
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.880]   the ideas of probability and statistics
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:11.240]   have become very, very important, have also jumped forward.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.040]   So, and that's different from linear algebra,
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.160]   quite different.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:20.160]   So now we really have three major areas to me,
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:25.200]   calculus, linear algebra, matrices,
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:29.000]   and probability statistics.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   And they all deserve an important place.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   And calculus has traditionally had a lion's share
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.860]   of the time.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.280]   - Disproportionate share.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.760]   - Thank you, disproportionate, that's a good word.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:50.120]   - Of the love and attention from the excited young minds.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:55.480]   I know it's hard to pick favorites,
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.720]   but what is your favorite matrix?
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.400]   - What's my favorite matrix?
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:03.200]   Okay, so my favorite matrix is square, I admit it.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.480]   It's a square bunch of numbers,
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:10.200]   and it has twos running down the main diagonal.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.060]   And on the next diagonal,
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.380]   so think of top left to bottom right,
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.900]   twos down the middle of the matrix,
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.140]   and minus ones just above those twos,
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.020]   and minus ones just below those twos,
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.620]   and otherwise all zeros.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:31.620]   So mostly zeros, just three non-zero diagonals coming down.
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:34.380]   - What is interesting about it?
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:37.200]   - Well, all the different ways it comes up.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.220]   You see it in engineering,
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:44.100]   you see it as analogous in calculus to second derivative.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.620]   So calculus learns about taking the derivative,
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.640]   figuring out how fast something's changing.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:55.740]   But second derivative, now that's also important.
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.760]   That's how fast the change is changing,
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.060]   how fast the graph is bending,
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.160]   how fast it's curving.
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.140]   And Einstein showed that that's fundamental
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.560]   to understand space.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:15.980]   So second derivatives should have a bigger place
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:17.380]   in calculus.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:22.380]   Second, my matrices, which are like the linear algebra
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:29.380]   version of second derivatives, are neat in linear algebra.
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:32.820]   Yeah, just everything comes out right with those guys.
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.220]   - Beautiful.
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:38.380]   What did you learn about the process of learning
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:42.820]   by having taught so many students math over the years?
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.820]   - Ooh, that is hard.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:50.680]   I'll have to admit here that I'm not really a good teacher
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.540]   because I don't get into the exam part.
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.000]   The exam's the part of my life that I don't like,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.060]   and grading them, and giving the students A or B,
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.360]   or whatever.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.260]   I do it because I'm supposed to do it,
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:11.900]   but I tell the class at the beginning,
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.580]   I don't know if they believe me, probably they don't,
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:18.040]   I tell the class, I'm here to teach you.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.660]   I'm here to teach you math and not to grade you.
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.100]   But they're thinking, okay, this guy,
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:28.820]   when's he gonna, is he gonna give me an A minus,
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.420]   is he gonna give me a B plus, what?
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.060]   - What have you learned about the process of learning?
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:36.860]   - Of learning, yeah, well maybe,
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:41.400]   to give you a legitimate answer about learning,
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:45.620]   I should have paid more attention to the assessment,
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.720]   the evaluation part at the end.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.020]   But I like the teaching part at the start,
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.120]   that's the sexy part, to tell somebody
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.120]   for the first time about a matrix, wow.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.740]   - Is there, are there moments,
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:01.920]   so you are teaching a concept,
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.460]   are there moments of learning that you just see
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.220]   in the student's eyes, you don't need to look at the grades,
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.540]   but you see in their eyes that you hook them,
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:16.260]   that you connect with them in a way where,
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.980]   you know what, they fall in love with this beautiful world
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.500]   of math or this-- - They see that it's got
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.460]   some beauty there. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:28.060]   - Or conversely, that they give up at that point,
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.180]   is the opposite, the dark is saying that math,
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:33.340]   I'm just not good at math, I don't wanna walk away.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.300]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.700]   Maybe because of the approach in the past,
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:40.500]   they were discouraged, but don't be discouraged,
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.080]   it's too good to miss.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:48.420]   Yeah, well if I'm teaching a big class,
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.900]   do I know when, I think maybe I do,
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:55.460]   sort of, I mentioned at the very start,
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:46:00.460]   the four fundamental subspaces and the structure
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:04.740]   of the fundamental theorem of linear algebra,
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.780]   the fundamental theorem of linear algebra,
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:11.780]   that is the relation of those four subspaces,
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:15.580]   those four spaces, yeah, so I think that,
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.740]   I feel that the class gets it.
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:19.940]   - When they see it. - Yeah.
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:22.420]   - What advice do you have to a student
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:25.140]   just starting their journey in mathematics today?
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.980]   How do they get started?
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:27.820]   (laughing)
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:30.100]   - Now-- - Yeah, that's hard.
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.980]   - Well, I hope you have a teacher,
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:38.980]   professor who is still enjoying what he's doing,
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:43.300]   what he's teaching, still looking for new ways
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.680]   to teach and to understand math,
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.620]   'cause that's the pleasure,
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:54.980]   the moment when you see, oh yeah, that works.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:57.180]   - So it's less about the material you--
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.500]   - Yeah. - You study,
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:02.500]   it's more about the source of the teacher
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.940]   being full of passion for--
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:06.260]   - Yeah, more about the fun, yeah.
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:10.540]   - The fun. - The moment of getting it.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:14.180]   - But in terms of topics, linear algebra?
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:18.020]   - Well, that's my topic, but oh,
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:21.260]   there's beautiful things in geometry to understand.
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.940]   What's wonderful is that in the end,
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:28.660]   there's a pattern, there are rules
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:33.660]   that are followed in biology as there are in every field.
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:41.460]   - You describe the life of a mathematician
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.300]   as 100% wonderful.
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.660]   (laughing)
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.180]   Except for the grade stuff, having the good grades.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.020]   - Except for grades.
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:52.180]   - Yeah, when you look back at your life,
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.980]   what memories bring you the most joy and pride?
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:58.260]   - Well, that's a good question.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:01.580]   I certainly feel good when I,
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:06.180]   maybe I'm giving a class in 1806,
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:09.420]   that's MIT's linear algebra course that I started.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.660]   So sort of, there's a good feeling that,
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:15.740]   okay, I started this course, a lot of students take it,
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.780]   quite a few like it, yeah.
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:22.780]   So I'm sort of happy when I feel I'm helping
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.780]   make a connection between ideas and students,
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:31.900]   between theory and the reader.
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:37.380]   Yeah, I get a lot of very nice messages
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:43.580]   from people who've watched the videos and it's inspiring.
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:47.260]   I just, I'll maybe take this chance to say thank you.
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:51.540]   - Well, there's millions of students who you've taught
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.300]   and I am grateful to be one of them.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.820]   So Gilbert, thank you so much.
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:56.660]   It's been an honor.
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.220]   Thank you for talking today.
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:48:59.820]   - It was a pleasure, thanks.
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:02.620]   - Thank you for listening to this conversation
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.340]   with Gilbert Strang.
