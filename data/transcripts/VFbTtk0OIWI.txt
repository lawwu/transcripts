[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Ben writes in to ask this, "Is it right to baptize my severely autistic friend?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   If so, how can I explain the difference to infant baptizing friends and family?"
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   This is a question we get on occasion, Pastor John, and it's a question our friend John Knight has asked us to address on APJ in the past.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   John is a dear colleague of ours, a desiring God.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   And so, Pastor John, with severe cognitive impairment in those in our churches, young men, young women who cannot articulate a testimony,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   what's the threshold a Credo Baptist church would hold to in deciding whether or not to baptize such an individual?
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   I'm really glad parents have sent this in.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   I'm glad John Knight underlined it for us.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And here's—it gives me a chance to just say a little bit of a wider picture.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   So let me start general and get right down to the specific of, say, a child or a young adult who's mentally disabled.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   I want to say first that a church that's about to tackle this and either baptize or not baptize a person with cognitive impairment
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   needs to teach widely on baptism, faith, disability, so you don't spring this on your congregation.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   It shouldn't come out of nowhere.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   This is a golden opportunity for a pastor to bring the sorrows and the joys of these families before the church
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   and put the whole question in the bigger context of God's sovereignty and His goodness
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   and His ability to take the hardest situations and show His all-sufficiency in them.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   So that's the first thing I'd say is put this issue in the bigger context of disability and God's sovereign goodness in your church.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And then the second thing I'd say is deal with believers' baptism before you try to deal with a marginal issue in believers' baptism.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   We believe, we Baptists believe, that before Jesus inaugurated the new covenant, in His blood,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   the people of God were identified through a physical line of Jewishness,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   and therefore it was fitting that the sign belonging to this people, the sign of the covenant belonging to this people,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   was given to their physical children, the Jews, and that sign was circumcision.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   But with the new covenant, God's saving focus is no longer on any ethnic group,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   but is defined most essentially by identification with Jesus the Christ through faith.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And thus the new sign of this new covenant is no longer circumcision but baptism,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   and no longer given to physical descendants but to spiritual descendants, that is, to those who have faith.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   That's the fundamental picture of believers' baptism.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   And here are two texts. This is not an APJ about baptism mainly, but about what about these kids.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   But here are two texts for people to think about.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   1 Peter 3.21, "Baptism, which corresponds to this, the flood, now saves you."
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Sounds kind of dangerous. Sounds like baptism or regeneration, but listen,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   "saves you not as a removal of dirt from the body," so I'm not talking about saving you by the effectiveness of the water,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   "but as an appeal to God for a good conscience through the resurrection of Jesus Christ."
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So baptism is pictured here as an event in which the baptismal candidate is making an appeal to God for a good conscience
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   through submitting to this water baptism symbolic of his death and resurrection with Christ.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And so that's a conscious act of the candidate, and hence we don't do it to children who can't make that—
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   little infants who can't make that appeal.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Or here's one other text, Colossians 2.12, "Having been buried therefore with him in baptism,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   in which you were also raised with him through faith."
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   That was so big for me when I was in Germany trying to battle with these Lutherans in all my classes.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I was the only Baptist in the group, and this text was hugely important for me.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   "Having been buried therefore with him in baptism, in which," in baptism, "you were raised with him through faith."
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   So I say it was through faith that we were raised with him.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   So those are two texts that point me to believers' baptism.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Now, which leaves us asking, what about those with severe cognitive impairment?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Both the inability to, say, grasp ideas at the front end and the ability to express them at the back end.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And I think the first thing we should do is make clear that if a family moves forward with baptism,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   it's not because these young people belong to a Christian family, either by birth or adoption.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   That would signify a wrong theology, namely, connectedness by flesh is spiritually saving.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So if you're saying, "Well, the reason this baby should be—I mean, this child should be baptized,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   this 18-year-old should be baptized is because he's in my family and I'm a Christian," that's a bad theology.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   We're not saved by belonging to families.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Another thing to make clear is that we don't believe that someone who, for reasons beyond their control, is not baptized would therefore be lost.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   The thief on the cross was not baptized, and Jesus said, "Today you'll be with me in paradise," because there was an extenuating circumstance.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   And so we shouldn't communicate that we've got to get this person baptized,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   because if they're not baptized, they may not go to heaven. That would be a wrong view of why we might want to move with these young people towards baptism.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   So here's my counsel—very practical. And I can imagine godly, biblically-informed pastors taking a different approach than me, so I'm not absolutizing this.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I would say, if the child or the young adult gives evidence that he is perceiving the love of God in Christ,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   if he's sensing in some way his own sin and need and responding with some signs of humble gladness because of Christ,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   it would be fitting to trust the perceptions of the mature believers closest to him and baptize him or her.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   If I were the pastor, I would give serious thought and preparation to the liturgy, the words that will be spoken over the child,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   so that everyone knows how seriously this has been considered and how it is being understood.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And then I would say, finally, if the child is so impaired that the child or the young adult has no perception of spiritual things,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   no perceptible signs of response, I think those who are responsible for him should not pursue baptism.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   But the mindset of the parents or the caregivers should be this—and this is very important—
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   they should say, "It's not because he's not saved." Don't say, "It's not because he's not saved."
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Rather, it's because the integrity of baptism would be preserved rather than giving the impression that it's a magical ritual.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   "Well, he's got to be baptized, even though there's no evidence."
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   In this case, it seems to me we would not be upholding baptism if we didn't baptize him, but we would be upholding grace.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   The parents should continue to bathe the child, the young adult, in word and prayer and trust that God, in his mercy,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   will work savingly in ways that no one but he can understand.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Yes, excellent. Thank you, Pastor John, for those thoughts.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Disability is a central topic for us at Desiring God, and we produce an e-book on the subject titled Disability and the Sovereign Goodness of God.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   You can download the e-book free of charge right now at DesiringGod.org.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Click on the tab that says "Books" and look for the title, Disability and the Sovereign Goodness of God.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   We will be back tomorrow with another episode in the Ask Pastor John series, and we're talking about God, guns, and biblical manhood.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Specifically, is it necessary for a Christian man in his divine calling to protect his wife and children, to own and be willing to use a gun?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Hmm. That should be a very interesting episode. I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you tomorrow.
