[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   We are still engaged in considering this great and important verse, the 18th verse in the
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.560]   first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.560]   "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.280]   of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.120]   The apostle is explaining why he glories in the gospel and why he's ready to preach it
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.280]   at Rome or anywhere else.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.200]   And it is partly because of its own inherent greatness, because of its character, because
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.080]   of its content.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.400]   But he says that isn't the only thing.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.800]   There is something else, and this is very urgent, and that is that the wrath of God
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.880]   has been revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.960]   Now we've been already considering this, we've considered some general difficulties which
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.940]   people seem to have with this doctrine.
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.800]   And we have shown that the only real reply to that is that it's scriptural.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.980]   Ten times over the apostle mentions it in this one epistle alone, and it's to be found
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.960]   everywhere running right through the entire scripture.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.320]   And then we have also considered how it has been revealed.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.520]   The apostle says it's a fact.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.600]   The wrath of God has been revealed quite as much as the righteousness of God by faith
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.520]   has been revealed.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.720]   The wrath is as much a revelation as is the gospel itself.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.920]   So if we accept the one revelation, how can we possibly ignore or refuse the other revelation?
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.020]   It puts us into an illogical and into an inconsistent as well as an unscriptural position.
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.160]   And then we ended last week by just considering how in general and when the wrath of God is
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.560]   revealed.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.560]   But now we must go on this evening to consider the next point which the apostle puts before
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.560]   us.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.060]   Namely, against what is the wrath of God revealed?
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.980]   And the answer is plain.
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.860]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.760]   who hold or hold down the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.820]   In other words, the apostle here makes a tremendous comprehensive statement.
[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.860]   You can't imagine a more comprehensive statement than this.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:52.580]   He tells us two things, the nature of sin and the utter inexcusability of sin.
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.960]   The wrath of God is revealed against sin and it's absolutely inexcusable.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.200]   And he works out those two themes.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.580]   Now we must take them one by one.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.300]   First of all, we must take sin itself and consider what the apostle tells us about the
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.380]   nature, the character of sin.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.140]   What constitutes sin?
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.940]   And here again he puts it in an all-inclusive form.
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.580]   Sin is any transgression of the law.
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.860]   There are many other definitions of sin, but the one the apostle particularly puts before
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:38.940]   us here is sin as a violation or a transgression of the law.
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.940]   What is the law?
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.020]   Well, the law consists of two tables, you remember.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.980]   We were reminded of that in our reading of the Ten Commandments just now, the first table
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.900]   and the second table.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.020]   How are they divided up?
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.900]   Well, quite simply in this way.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.060]   The first has reference to our relationship to God.
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.420]   So that the first way to look at sin is ungodliness.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.580]   We were created for godliness.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.220]   Not to be godly is sin, therefore.
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.180]   So he puts it as ungodliness.
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:22.660]   Any transgression of the first table of the law comes under the category of ungodliness
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.140]   and therefore has reference, especially and primarily, to our attitude towards God and
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.180]   our relationship to God.
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.680]   Then of course the second table is the table that deals with our conduct, with our behavior,
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:46.740]   if you like, with our relationship with men and women, father and mother, neighbor, acquaintance,
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.260]   other people alive in the world.
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.340]   Our conduct, in a sense, is just the question of our relationship to other people.
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.500]   No man liveth unto himself.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.380]   Everything we do affects others.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:08.260]   So that the second table consists of the definition of our relationships, our contacts with human
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.260]   beings.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.800]   God in the first, men in general in the second.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.860]   And to fail at any point in our relationships with other human beings constitutes unrighteousness.
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.940]   So you see, the apostle obviously has these things in his mind.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.760]   All ungodliness, all unrighteousness of men, first table, second table.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:38.600]   Any transgression of either of them constitutes sin.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:46.880]   Now it's a very important thing for us to remember that sin, all sin, is rarely comprehended
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.860]   under those two headings.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:57.420]   I'm emphasizing it because I think there is a grave danger for many of us to be so concerned
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:03.840]   about and interested in particular sins that we tend to forget sin itself, and it's a fatal
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.580]   error that.
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:12.300]   You will find that people who are not Christian never object to talk about sins, but they
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.080]   hate this talk about sin, because it's much more convicting, of course, as we shall see
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.500]   in a moment.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.660]   Now the apostle, I say clearly, has the two tables of the law in his mind, and there,
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.100]   of course, he's just repeating what our blessed Lord and Savior himself did.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.320]   You remember how we are told in the twelfth chapter of Mark's Gospel how a certain lawyer
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.640]   came to him on one occasion and said, "I've got a question to put to you.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.420]   Which is the first commandment of the law, or which is the first and the greatest commandment
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.920]   of the law?"
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.640]   And you remember how our Lord replied.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.360]   He said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.640]   with all thy mind and with all thy strength.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.800]   That is the first and the greatest and the chiefest commandment.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.360]   And the second is likened to it.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.920]   Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.960]   Now there is exactly the same thingâ€”godliness, righteousness.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.360]   And you see that it is important that we should understand that under those two hearings the
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.000]   whole of sin is rarely comprehended.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.520]   Now the apostle, as it were, in this eighteenth verse is therefore stating his text.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.960]   And what you've got in the whole of the remainder of this first chapter is just the
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.640]   apostle's sermon on that text.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.160]   The whole of the remainder of the chapter is just an exposition of and an illustration
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:56.040]   of how mankind has become guilty in the matter of ungodliness and of unrighteousness as well.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:02.640]   And he works it out in all its horrifying and horrible details.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:08.440]   He shows us how mankind deliberately turned from God and chose unrighteousness and even
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.200]   gloried in it.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:18.000]   He shows us therefore how utterly inexcusable it is and all that it leads to.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.080]   And he shows us the appalling consequences which are followed as the result of it.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:31.280]   And finally he shows us what God has done about it.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.840]   Now that's the remainder of the chapter, which we've got to take up point by point
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.880]   and consider it in detail.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.320]   Now we must start therefore with this definition of sin.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:55.200]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.400]   Now there are two comments here which again I would stress because I regard them as very
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.400]   important.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.460]   The first is this.
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:14.800]   These two things must always be taken together, ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.280]   Or to put them in the positive form, godliness and righteousness.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.440]   They must never be separated.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.240]   They must always go together.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:31.400]   Now you know the history of the Church bears eloquent testimony to the disaster that follows
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.520]   whenever these two things are separated.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:42.840]   When people forget on the one hand the importance of their relationship to God, or when on the
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.920]   other hand, imagining that their relationship to God is all right, they forget their conduct
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.520]   and their behavior and their practice.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:10:00.080]   And the two things are each of them as dangerous as the other and as fatal to the Christian
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.080]   life.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.200]   Very well, let us always make certain, I say, that these two things go together.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.840]   The apostle in another epistle, you remember, talks about certain people who have a form
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.720]   of godliness but deny the power thereof.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.560]   They talked about God.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.920]   They seem to be interested in God.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.000]   They might have prayed to God, but their lives, he says, were denying it and therefore it
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.380]   is not real.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.060]   You must never separate righteousness and godliness, or godliness and righteousness.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:35.920]   Never separate ungodliness and unrighteousness, or unrighteousness and ungodliness.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.160]   These things must always go together.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.840]   There is no such thing as godliness without righteousness.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.360]   Very well, I lay great stress and emphasis upon that.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:55.260]   But having said that, I hurry to say this, that it is very important and equally important
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:00.140]   for us to observe the order in which the apostle puts them.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.000]   Two things always go together, I say.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.280]   Yes, but it is very important that the first is first and the second is second, and not
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.120]   the second first and the first second.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.800]   Now this I want to try to show you is not something that the apostle does without thought
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.000]   or accidentally, as if he might equally well have put unrighteousness before ungodliness.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Not at all.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.280]   This is really a very fundamental and a pivotal point.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.680]   Godliness must always come before righteousness.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.760]   Why?
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:43.040]   This I feel is particularly important today, because as I want to show you, there is, I
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:50.440]   think, I fear, a tendency to forget this order and the vital importance of preserving this
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.440]   order.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.760]   Very well, why is it important always to put godliness first, righteousness second, or
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.560]   ungodliness first, and unrighteousness second?
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.520]   Well, here are some of the reasons.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:12.200]   The real essence of sin is ungodliness.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.920]   That is really what constitutes sin.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.040]   I say that is the essence of sin.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.320]   That is the thing that really makes sin, sin.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.200]   It is our whole relationship to God.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.840]   Now we must be clear in our minds as to what ungodliness means.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:40.520]   It means a refusal in any shape or form, and it doesn't matter what, it is a refusal to
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:51.280]   live entirely and only to God's glory and to the praise of his holy name.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:57.920]   Any failure to do that, or any lack of desire to do that, is ungodliness.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.080]   So let's be clear about this.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.560]   We come back again to that statement of our blessed Lord to that lion.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:15.280]   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.800]   mind, and with all thy strength."
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.120]   Now you can't have anything more complete than that.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.400]   That is what God demands of us, that is what God expects of us.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:35.480]   And to fail to live like that is to be ungodly.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.040]   Whatever the degree may be, whatever the form, it doesn't matter.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:46.540]   We are meant to desire God with the whole of our being, and not to do so is sin.
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:54.520]   We are to desire to know God, and to regard it as the supreme object of our lives in this
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.800]   world, to know God.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.420]   We must desire his glory.
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.880]   We must desire to live for his glory, therefore.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.460]   We must seek his will.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.840]   We must desire to know his will.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:20.760]   And our greatest endeavor always should be to do his will in all things and in all respects,
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.060]   whatever the consequences may be.
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.880]   That is godliness.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.000]   That is what you find in the life of our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.680]   His one concern while he was here in this world was to glorify the Father.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.200]   He can say at the end, "I have glorified thy name.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.500]   I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do."
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.040]   He came not to do his own will, but the will of the Father which had sent him.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.020]   And you notice how frequently you read in the Gospels that when he worked a miracle
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:03.280]   or something like that, we are told the people glorified God, or they praised God.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:09.500]   His whole life was lived entirely and only to the glory of God.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.240]   He says, "I seek not mine own glory, but the glory of him that sent me."
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.660]   Now there it is in perfection.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:24.680]   Now the Bible teaches us that God made men to that end.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.080]   Come back again to the first question of that shorter catechism, "What is the chief end
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.080]   of men?"
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:36.920]   And the answer is, "The chief end of men is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever."
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.440]   That is the chief end of men.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.440]   And to fall short of that in any respect is to be guilty of ungodliness, to be guilty
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.680]   of sin.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:52.200]   Well, you see why this must come first?
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.800]   You see why this must be the first thing and not drunkenness or adultery or this or that
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   or the other?
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:08.600]   You know, our relationship to God and this conception that men is made to glorify God.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:14.560]   Very well then, I say that our Lord makes it perfectly plain and clear that that is
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:19.600]   the first, the chiefest, the greatest of all.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.240]   So we start with it.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:29.640]   Another reason for putting ungodliness before unrighteousness is this, that after all, ungodliness
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.800]   was the first sin.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.880]   That is what you get in the third of Genesis, isn't it?
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:41.040]   Adam, there are Adam and Eve, perfect, without sin.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.120]   Then you look at them and you see their form, they are in sin.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.600]   But how did they sin?
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.520]   Well, you remember the story, they sinned in this way.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:57.040]   After all, Eve and Adam ate the fruit of the prohibited tree.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.000]   They had already done something else.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.120]   They had fallen into this transgression of ungodliness.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:09.320]   The first thing that happened was their queering of God.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.040]   In other words, they are detracting from the glory of God.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.600]   They are failing to live to the glory of God.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.120]   The setting up of themselves as against God, that is ungodliness.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.920]   So you are bound to put ungodliness before unrighteousness.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:30.600]   In the actual historical chronological sequence, ungodliness came before unrighteousness.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:36.360]   And therefore we must always put them in that particular order.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:42.520]   But then I have got another reason, my third reason is this.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:50.560]   Unrighteousness rarely only becomes possible because of ungodliness.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:57.080]   You cannot have unrighteousness without ungodliness.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.320]   Unrighteousness is a consequence, if you like, of ungodliness.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.040]   If only the attitude of all of us were always right towards God, we would never be guilty
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.540]   of particular acts of transgression.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:14.480]   As long as the relationship remains right, the conduct remains right.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.760]   This is the controlling thing, therefore.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.400]   Again, you see it in the life of our Lord, you see it in Adam and Eve before the fall.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.640]   While they maintained the conduct, while they did not allow that insinuation about God's
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.840]   character to come in, their conduct was all right.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:36.420]   First of all, they fall away from God and then they fall into actual acts of transgression.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:41.600]   So there again is a very important consideration.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:47.300]   Another one is this, of course, and a very important practical one.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:57.660]   The only way to convict all people of sin is to put ungodliness before unrighteousness.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:03.560]   You see, when you come to unrighteousness, you are obviously dealing with particulars.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:08.640]   And we've got a horrible list of them here, as I've already indicated, this, that, and
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.640]   the other.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.560]   Ah, yes, but you see, there are certain people who can read a list like this and they can
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.560]   say to themselves they're quite guiltless.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:22.560]   They're not abusers of themselves with men kind or effeminate, not drunkards, not inviolable,
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.560]   none of these things.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:29.240]   And of course, they just feel that they're not sinners.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:34.640]   It's almost incredible, but I'm sure we've all met somebody who's in that position some
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.640]   time or another.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.560]   Many times I've had people saying to me something like this.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.280]   They've said, "You know, I've got to be quite honest, you see.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:49.200]   If I said that I felt I was a sinner, I wouldn't be speaking the truth.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.620]   You see, you know, I don't feel I'm a sinner."
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.160]   What they mean is, of course, that because they've never been guilty of these particular
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:01.880]   actions, they've never been guilty of any one of the things in their particular little
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:06.280]   list, they therefore feel that they're not sinners.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.480]   They've never felt the necessity to cry for mercy and for pardon, and they rather feel
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:17.120]   that these people we read of in the Bible who cry to God to have mercy upon them and
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.120]   of whom they read in the biographies, they don't understand them.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   They feel they're perhaps a little bit abnormal or that it's poetic fancy and the natural
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.000]   tendency to exaggerate or to over-dramatize themselves.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.840]   They say, "You know, I've never really felt that I'm a sinner in the sight of God."
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:39.480]   Of course, that kind of person is simply saying that he or she has never faced the question
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:48.720]   of godliness and the terrible sin of ungodliness, and that the first sin is ungodliness, and
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.320]   that the essence of sin is ungodliness.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:57.920]   You see, there is no greater sin than this, than to feel that as you are unaided, you
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.380]   are fit to stand in the presence of God.
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.380]   Why is that sin?
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.380]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:08.040]   It just means that you have no conception of the glory and the majesty and the holiness
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:14.800]   of God, and that in itself is sin of the deepest dye.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.480]   You've got a little god of your own which you've conjured up in your own mind, a god
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.440]   who's more or less like yourself.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:26.840]   If you but had some conception of the god who's revealed himself here and in Jesus
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:34.520]   Christ, why at once you'd be conscious of your unworthiness and your uncleanness.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.720]   How many days have passed and you haven't thought of him, you haven't thanked him,
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.260]   you've taken everything for granted.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.600]   Are you living every second to his glory?
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.600]   Let me repeat it.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:49.920]   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.880]   mind, and with all thy strength."
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.960]   Not to do that is not to glorify God.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.840]   It is therefore terrible sin.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.080]   You see the importance of putting ungodliness before unrighteousness.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:09.380]   There's nothing more fatal than to leave out ungodliness and just rush to unrighteousness.
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.500]   So many people, I say, come to the conclusion that they're not sinners at all.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:18.980]   But the moment you face godliness, well then, you'll have no difficulty in understanding
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:25.080]   how Paul was able to say in the third chapter of this great epistle, "There is none righteous,
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.080]   no not one.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:31.880]   All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God."
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.600]   That's how he convicts everybody.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.360]   That's how every mouth is stopped and the whole world lies guilty before God.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.960]   Not that they've done this and that, but that they've come short of the glory of God.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.640]   And we have no right to come short of the glory of God.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.160]   This is God's demand.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.600]   And to fail is to be guilty of terrible, appalling sin.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:58.040]   But then let me go on and put it like this.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:07.440]   It is sinful and insulting to God to believe that morality or righteousness is possible
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.160]   apart from him.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:16.360]   And that is really what is implied when people put righteousness before godliness.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:23.880]   I say it is sinful, it's insulting to God to suggest that, that you can have a morality
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.600]   apart from God.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.480]   Incidentally, as I shall point out to you in a moment, you can't get it.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.680]   It can't happen.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:35.560]   But even to believe that it can happen is appalling sin.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:42.480]   Because, as I've been showing you, these things are so interrelated that it is only
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.360]   godliness that can lead to righteousness.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:51.280]   And therefore to suggest that you can have righteousness, morality, ethics, without God
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:56.320]   and the power that he alone can give, is to detract from the glory of God and is to sin
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.640]   against him.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:11.360]   But my sixth and my last reason is this, that this, after all, is the primary matter
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.600]   on which we shall all be judged.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:24.960]   Oh yes, our works will follow us, all things are written in the book, but the primary matter
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:35.960]   on which all will be judged is precisely this, our relationship to God, our response to God
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:41.640]   in all that he is and in all that he has done, including, of course, his sending of his only
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.960]   son into the world.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.920]   But even before that is our relationship to God himself.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:56.480]   Well, there you are, there are six reasons at any rate which show us the vital importance
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:05.040]   of putting godliness before righteousness and the sin of ungodliness before the sin
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.400]   of unrighteousness.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:14.320]   I regard this as so important that I want at this point to make some comments and to
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:23.360]   draw some deductions, because it does seem to me more and more that we cannot understand
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:29.200]   the modern world nor the church as she is today, unless we are clear about this particular
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   point.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:39.720]   Now, the whole cause of the trouble in the world today, and for many years, is due to
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:48.560]   the fact that men have been forgetting this sequence, this order.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.960]   The trouble is that for a number of years, and it's true, alas, speaking of the Christian
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:26:03.720]   church in general as well as the world, is that men have been interested in religion
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:13.520]   without God, or if you like, they've been interested in morality without God, or interested
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.800]   in righteousness without godliness.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:24.040]   Now, to me this is a very important and fascinating historical point.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.800]   When exactly did that come in?
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.680]   I don't quite know, but it certainly came in somewhere, I should say, towards the middle
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.440]   or the end of the Victorian era.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.280]   It's happened many a time before in the long history of the Christian church.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:45.000]   The church started with godliness and righteousness as a result of it.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.960]   Yes, but the tendency always is to forget the godliness and to think you can go on with
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.960]   the righteousness.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.880]   And, of course, this is the peculiar sin of good people.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.720]   There are certain evil people who are not interested in righteousness or godliness.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:04.200]   I'm not considering them for the moment, I'm considering good people.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.200]   There are people, you see, who like to have an ordered society.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.480]   They don't like drunkenness and immorality and all that kind of thing.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.400]   They like a nice, decent, respectable, ordered, law-abiding society.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.480]   That's what they really want, so that they can live in peace and without troubles and
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.960]   problems.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:33.120]   Their danger always is to imagine that you can have a religion without this vital relationship
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.120]   to God.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.660]   Oh, yes, they say it's a good thing to be religious.
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:41.040]   After all, they say when a country is religious, you always have a better-ordered society.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.640]   There won't be so many strikes and so on, and there won't be so much litigation.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.960]   If only people were all godly, well, you'd avoid these industrial disputes and so on.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:55.120]   So they tend to think at a time like this, you see, that the country needs a little more
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.120]   religion.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.200]   So they call in the church to help them, to solve their problems.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.200]   Religion produces morality, they say.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.200]   They're not interested in glorifying God.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.680]   They don't propose to love him with all their hearts and minds and soul and strength.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.680]   Not at all.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.800]   But they say, "Teach religion in the schools.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.480]   It'll make for better discipline.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.160]   It'll make children behave better.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.200]   Get these great principles of behavior and morality into their minds.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   Moral teaching is very good."
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:30.360]   Now, I'm afraid in many respects Thomas Arnold of Rugby was mainly responsible for this,
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:36.400]   the so-called public school religion, which is concerned about producing a gentleman.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.040]   Not a saint, but a gentleman.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.040]   You see the distinction?
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.240]   He's got to be behaving properly.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.480]   He's got to be orderly in his conduct.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:49.000]   They're not really interested in a vital knowledge of God.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.800]   That is, an attempt to have righteousness without godliness.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:59.400]   Oh, it's an appalling thought this, but you can be religious without being godly.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.320]   You can enjoy public worship without knowing God.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:07.840]   You can like the thing itself, religion, preaching, singing, praying, and all these things.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.600]   But there's no real knowledge of God and no real thirst for him.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.360]   And there is nothing more terrible than that.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:21.120]   Now, I think if you work it out in your minds, you'll see how it tended to happen along
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.120]   a number of lines.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.960]   I've given you one illustration already, Thomas Arnold.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:30.400]   Now, I don't want to be unfair in what I'm saying, but I put it for your meditation and
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.200]   your consideration.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.080]   Didn't something like that happen in the YMCA?
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.720]   Young Men's Christian Association.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.880]   It began like that.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.720]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.520]   Is it still that, I wonder?
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:48.960]   Didn't the emphasis suddenly change onto the social, the mere conduct and behavior,
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.640]   a good thing to keep young people off the streets, a good thing for them to meet together
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.080]   and have their games in a Christian atmosphere?
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.720]   That's how it began.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.520]   God was gradually forgotten and the emphasis was put on righteousness.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.440]   And in the end, you reach a point at which you are tempted at times to ask, well, does
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:13.440]   Christian still come in, or is the interest entirely and only on the social?
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.320]   I know many friends in the Salvation Army who are asking the same question about the
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.240]   Salvation Army.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.760]   We all know how it began, but you see, the social interest tends to come in, and you're
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.760]   concerned about behavior only.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.760]   And so the vital thing is forgotten.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:39.040]   I am suggesting seriously that the only way to understand the world and the Church today
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.760]   is to realize that it's all due to the forgetting that godliness must always come first, and
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:49.320]   righteousness only follows, and that you can't have true righteousness without it.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:54.160]   Well, that is my second point, my second comment.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:31:03.680]   The world today is proving that you cannot have righteousness without godliness.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.280]   It's proving it.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.720]   Now, I've been tracing the history for you.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:13.280]   The fact of the matter is today, the world is full of unrighteousness and of immorality
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.080]   and of amorality, the sort of thing that Paul goes on to describe.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.760]   We've come back to that.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.880]   Why have we come back to that?
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:27.840]   We've come back to that for the very reason that I've been giving.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:33.480]   Men thought that you could still have your Christian conduct and behavior without the
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   vital experience.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.560]   They said, "It doesn't matter what you believe about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.320]   Shed the virgin birth.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.480]   Shed the miracles.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.720]   Shed the substitutionary atonement.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.720]   Shed the resurrection.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:49.080]   Ah, yes, but let's have the teaching of Jesus, the social gospel, the Sermon on the Mount."
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.720]   That's what they were saying, you see, thirty and forty and fifty years ago.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:57.400]   They were turning away from godliness but concentrating on righteousness, the social
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.000]   application of the gospel.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.280]   They said, "This personal salvation of you evangelicals, this personal confrontation
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.880]   with God and this personal experience."
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.640]   They say, "You don't pay attention to ethics and to morality and to the social conditions."
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.840]   We now, they said, are concerned about society.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.360]   We're going to bring in the social emphasis.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.200]   But you see what it's led to?
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.080]   We haven't got social morality.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.840]   There is no ethical living.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.320]   The state of society is ungodly.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.320]   It's unrighteous.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.680]   It's broken down in morals.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.680]   Why?
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:36.000]   Well, because you'll never have morality except as an outcome of godliness.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.400]   It cannot be done.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.760]   It can't be done in theory in the Bible.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:45.860]   It simply cannot be done in practice, and the modern world is proving it.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.360]   If God isn't in your religion, your religion will do nothing.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.600]   It will be useless.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.840]   And the world today is demonstrating this particular point.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:06.120]   But as I say, alas, the same thing is true also, even in the realm of the church.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:12.840]   I wonder whether we evangelicals can claim that we are absolutely free at this point.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:16.080]   Let me put it like this, then.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   If we start with man instead of with God, we are guilty of reversing this order.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:32.320]   In our preaching, in our evangelism, in anything else.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:40.600]   And I solemnly suggest to you that we are in danger of forgetting God.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:48.720]   I'm going to say something that's liable to be misunderstood, but it's very vital.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:56.280]   There is a tendency to what I would call a Jesus-olitary.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:01.720]   There are Christian people who never mention the name of God the Father.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.040]   It is all the Son.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.840]   That is unscriptural, my friends.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:10.560]   It is wrong.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.080]   You don't put even the Son before the Father.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.660]   He never put himself there.
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:19.840]   And what was the object and purpose of his coming into this world?
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.560]   Was it simply to bring us to himself?
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.560]   Not at all.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.360]   To bring us to God?
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.600]   That was the object.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:33.000]   It must all center on God the Father.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.720]   But you see, we have become so subjective.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:39.320]   We are interested in ourselves and in our problems.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:44.320]   And we conceive of salvation not as something primarily that brings us to God, but something
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.960]   that gives me something.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.960]   And what is the result?
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:54.000]   A lack of the sense of God in our services, a lack of reverence, a lack of awe, a lack
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.760]   of holiness, a lightness, a glibness such as you never find in the Scriptures, which
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:05.400]   is unthinkable in the case of the Apostle Paul, or still more in the case of the Lord
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.920]   Jesus Christ himself.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:15.120]   A superficiality, a glibness, a lightness.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:23.080]   All those things come in because we have forgotten to put godliness before righteousness.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:28.540]   Of course the Gospel delivers you from particular sins and gives you particular experiences,
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.140]   but you mustn't start with them.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.720]   You start with God, your relationship to God.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.600]   It's that that's so terribly wrong.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.480]   That's much worse than everything else.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:46.640]   And unless that is put right, it will avail you nothing if the other things are put right.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:55.360]   So you see, it follows that there is such an inadequate conception of God's love, and
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:36:01.040]   of the grace of God, and of the whole character and being of God.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:08.280]   And that is why there is so little true heartfelt praise and joy and thanksgiving.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.760]   A matiness and a cheeriness isn't Christian joy.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:17.600]   Christian joy is that which realizes the holiness of God, the depth of sin, and Christ coming
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.680]   in and giving himself unto blood for it.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:29.440]   That leads to a holy joy, a thanksgiving and a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:38.680]   Am I being unfair when I say that I fear at times there is an absence of such joy and
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.960]   true rejoicing amongst us?
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.480]   If there is, it is due to the fact that we have put something before godliness.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.840]   Well, let me sum it up by putting it like this.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:58.160]   There therefore is no true evangelism without putting these things in this order.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:08.760]   The primary purpose of evangelism is to bring men and women to God, to the right relationship
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:13.720]   to God, to have a right attitude to God.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.400]   Nothing must come before that.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.380]   No benefit must even be considered before that.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:25.320]   We must not offer Christ as anything before we have started with that.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:34.360]   Can't you see that not only does it open the door to all the cults and all these other
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:39.800]   agencies that can make people happy and give them deliverance and so on, because let's
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:43.600]   be quite plain about this, the cults are succeeding.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.840]   Evangelism science is flourishing.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:52.080]   Semte Adventism, Jehovah's Witnesses and so on, all these things, they get their crowds,
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.280]   they get their results, and people testify to the marvelous difference it has made.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:01.520]   They can do it all, and psychology and all sorts of other things can do the same.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.760]   But I say that isn't the serious argument.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:14.880]   The serious argument is this, that it is violating the order that God himself has laid down.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.560]   You remember how the Ten Commandments start.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.920]   They don't start with the second table, they start with the first.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.920]   And therefore evangelism must start at the same point.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.360]   We must tell men and women that whatever may be true of them, whether they are happy or
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:32.880]   miserable, whether they are moral or immoral, the question is this, what is their relationship
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.880]   to God?
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:38.080]   Are they living entirely only to his glory?
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:43.760]   And we are to tell them that if they are not their sinners, that sin, not particular acts,
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:54.280]   but that, to withhold from the God who has made us anything of ourselves, is to sin against
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:39:00.720]   him, grievously, terribly, awfully, and is to merit the punishment and the damnation
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.280]   of hell.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:09.960]   So that you see, when we evangelize, we are not primarily interested in people's stories
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.760]   as to how they have lived or what they have done.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.720]   We know that every one of them is a sinner.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.680]   The respectable as well as the others, and that is why in a sense testimony giving is
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.100]   rarely beside the point.
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:25.760]   If you start with godliness, this is the object.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.840]   Are they in relationship to God?
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.840]   Do they know him?
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.560]   Are they honoring him?
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.520]   Are they living to his glory?
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:41.840]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into the world primarily to bring us to God.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.440]   God was in Christ doing what?
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.680]   Reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.160]   That is the first thing.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:40:01.920]   Bringing men and women back to the relationship in which he originally made them and for which
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.620]   he intended them.
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.640]   Very well, my friends, we leave it at that for this evening.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:11.360]   But you see the importance of observing the order?
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:20.200]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:25.480]   It would not be a bad thing to leave it just like that.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:29.880]   All ungodliness.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:35.400]   And your unrighteousness is simply something that makes it still worse.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:40.280]   We deserve hell because we are ungodly.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.480]   And all who remain ungodly will go there.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:52.160]   The wrath of God has been revealed against all ungodliness.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.160]   Amen.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:41:05.960]   O Lord, our God, we thank thee that as we turn to thee again thou hast opened our eyes
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:06.960]   to see this.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:15.400]   And O Lord, our God, we thank thee that the result of thy grace upon us is that we desire
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.720]   thee.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:23.920]   We feel we have often insulted thee by desiring gifts and not desiring thee.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:31.680]   But now, O God, our souls cry out for thee, the living God.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:39.320]   And we thank thee that in Christ we know thee, the only true God.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:50.440]   O, we offer our humble and worthy praise for him in whom thou hast reconciled us unto thyself,
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:55.320]   not imputing our trespasses unto us.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:02.280]   Give our praise, O God, and enable us at all times and in all things to manifest forth
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:11.200]   thy praise and thy glory, thy virtues, thy righteousness and justice in all our living.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:18.320]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:25.000]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.120]   Throughout the remainder of this hour, short and sudden, earthly life and pilgrimage.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:37.000]   And until we shall see him in glory.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.360]   Amen.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.280]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
