[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - The strings kind of inspire a view,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   as did atoms and particles and quarks,
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.360]   but especially strings inspire a view of the universe
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.640]   as a kind of information processing system,
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.200]   as a computer of sorts.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.320]   Do you see the universe in this way?
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.600]   - No.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.080]   Some people think, in fact, the whole universe
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.480]   is a computer of some sort.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.240]   And they believe that perhaps everything,
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.680]   therefore, is a simulation.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.680]   - Yes.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.000]   - I don't think so.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.960]   I don't think that there is a super video game
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.320]   where we are nothing but puppets dancing on the screen
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.120]   and somebody hit the play button
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.240]   and here we are talking about simulations.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.240]   No, even Newtonian mechanics says that the weather,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.480]   the simple weather, is so complicated
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.960]   with trillions upon trillions of atoms
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.480]   that it cannot be simulated in a finite amount of time.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.520]   In other words, the smallest object
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.280]   which can describe the weather and simulate the weather
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.000]   is the weather itself.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   The smallest object that can simulate a human
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.600]   is the human itself.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.480]   And if you had quantum mechanics,
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.120]   it becomes almost impossible to simulate it
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.440]   with a conventional computer.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.200]   This quantum mechanics deals with all possible universes,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.040]   parallel universes, a multiverse of universes.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.240]   And so the calculation just spirals out of control.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.360]   Now, at so far, there's only one way
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.920]   where you might be able to argue
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.920]   that the universe is a simulation.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.040]   And this is still being debated by quantum physicists.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.120]   It turns out that if you throw the encyclopedia
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.600]   into a black hole, the information is not lost.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.200]   Eventually, it winds up on the surface of the black hole.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.560]   Now, the surface of the black hole is finite.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.120]   In fact, you can calculate the maximum amount of information
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.240]   you can store in a black hole.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.760]   It's a finite number.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.320]   It's a calculable number, believe it or not.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.320]   Now, if the universe were made out of black holes,
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.600]   which is the maximum universe you can conceive of,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.760]   each universe, each black hole
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.200]   has a finite amount of information.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.160]   Therefore, ergo, ta-da,
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.640]   ergo, the total amount of information
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.480]   in a universe is finite.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.080]   This is mind-boggling.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.560]   This, I consider mind-boggling,
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.200]   that all possible universes are countable,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.600]   and all possible universes can be summarized in a number,
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.640]   a number you can write on a sheet of paper,
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.760]   all possible universes, and it's a finite number.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.240]   Now, it's huge.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.240]   It's a number beyond human imagination.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.560]   It's a number based on what is called a Planck length,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.280]   but it's a number.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.160]   And so if a computer could ever simulate that number,
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.680]   then the universe would be a simulation.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.440]   - So theoretically,
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.360]   because the amount of information is finite,
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.360]   there necessarily must be able to exist a computer.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.440]   It's just, from an engineering perspective,
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.680]   maybe impossible to build.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.520]   - Yes, no computer can build a universe
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.880]   capable of simulating the entire universe,
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.600]   except the universe itself.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.080]   - So that's your intuition,
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.920]   that our universe is very efficient,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.560]   and so there's no shortcuts.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.240]   - Right, two reasons why I believe
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.920]   the universe is not a simulation.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.080]   First, the calculational numbers are just incredible.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.960]   No finite Turing machine can simulate the universe.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.720]   And second, why would any super intelligent being
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.000]   simulate humans?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.600]   If you think about it, most humans are kind of stupid.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.680]   I mean, we do all sorts of crazy, stupid things, right?
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.520]   And we call it art, we call it humor,
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.920]   we call it human civilization.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.440]   So why should an advanced civilization
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.960]   go through all that effort
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.920]   just to simulate a Saturday Night Live?
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.000]   - Well, that's a funny idea,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   but it's also, do you think it's possible
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.720]   that the act of creation cannot anticipate humans?
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.400]   You simply set the initial conditions
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.600]   and set a bunch of physical laws,
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.360]   and just for the fun of it, see what happens.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.520]   You launch the thing,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.320]   so you're not necessarily simulating everything.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.640]   You're not simulating every little bit
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.320]   in the sense that you could predict what's going to happen,
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.600]   but you set the initial conditions, set the laws,
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.800]   and see what kind of fun stuff happens.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.560]   - Well, in some sense, that's how life got started.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.760]   In the 1950s, Stanley did what is called
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.400]   the Miller experiment.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   He put a bunch of hydrogen gas, methane, toxic gases
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.960]   with liquid and a spark in a small glass beaker,
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.720]   and then he just walked away for a few weeks,
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.080]   came back a few weeks later, and bingo,
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.400]   out of nothing and chaos came amino acids.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.600]   If he had left it there for a few years,
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.800]   he might've gotten protein, protein molecules for free.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.320]   That's probably how life got started, as a accident.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.520]   And if he had left it there for perhaps a few million years,
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.400]   DNA might have formed in that beaker.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.080]   And so we think that, yeah, DNA, life,
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.400]   all that could have been an accident
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.040]   if you wait long enough.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.160]   And remember, our universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.480]   That's plenty of time for lots of random things to happen,
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.680]   including life itself.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.960]   - Yeah, we could be just a beautiful little random moment
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.040]   and there could be an infinite number of those
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.960]   throughout the history of the universe,
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.320]   many creatures like us.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.840]   We perhaps are not the epitome
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.640]   of what the universe was created for.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.480]   - Thank God.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.520]   (both laughing)
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.360]   Let's hope not.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.080]   Just look around.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.280]   - Yeah.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.280]   - Look to your left, look to your right.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.960]   (both laughing)
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:26.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
