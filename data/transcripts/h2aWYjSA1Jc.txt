[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.160]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.040]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.040]   Today, we're talking all about sleep
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.320]   and how to optimize your sleep.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.240]   This is a topic we've covered previously on this podcast
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.700]   in the episode called Master Your Sleep.
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.040]   However, since the airing of that episode,
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.520]   there's been some terrific new science to come out.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.120]   I've also received thousands,
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.320]   yes, literally thousands of questions
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.480]   related to the specific protocols covered in that episode,
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.900]   as well as in the episode on jet lag and shift work.
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.800]   And while today's episode is not specifically
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.420]   about jet lag and shift work,
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.400]   we are going to cover tools that will allow you
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.160]   to shift your schedule if you need to for work or travel.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.320]   And we will also cover tools
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.160]   that will allow you to fall back asleep
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.200]   if you happen to wake up in the middle of the night,
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.600]   or if you get a poor night's sleep,
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.540]   how to actually recover from that poor night's sleep
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.620]   more quickly, and yes indeed,
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.080]   even replace sleep that you've lost.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.400]   So today's episode is going to be filled
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.520]   with practical tools.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.800]   We will touch on some of the underlying science,
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.440]   but it's really designed to be a practical toolkit
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.020]   for optimizing your sleep
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.120]   depending on your specific sleep needs.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.080]   Various times throughout today's episode,
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.600]   I will refer to studies that form the backbone
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.440]   of the tools that I'll be describing,
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.480]   but whereas most of the podcast episodes here
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.720]   tend to be deep scientific mechanism,
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.480]   and then tools, scientific mechanism,
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.620]   and tools today, I'm mainly going to focus
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.620]   on the practical tools that anyone, indeed,
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.180]   all people I believe should use
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.880]   in order to optimize their sleep.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.260]   Why should everybody want to optimize their sleep
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.480]   and put considerable effort into optimizing their sleep?
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.400]   Well, put simply, sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.460]   physical health, and performance of all kinds,
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.960]   cognitive performance, physical performance, et cetera.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.700]   It also controls things like our immune system,
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.320]   wound healing, our skin health, and our appearance.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.800]   Whether or not we can think clearly or not,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.240]   whether or not we will live
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.900]   as long as we possibly can or not,
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.060]   whether or not we suffer from dramatic age-related
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.880]   cognitive decline or not,
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.920]   in other words, whether or not we keep our memory as we age,
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.140]   I could go on and on about all the terrible things
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.520]   that can happen to somebody if they don't sleep well.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.600]   Thanks to the great work of Professor Matt Walker
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.100]   at University of California, Berkeley,
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.720]   and the wonderful book that he wrote, "Why We Sleep,"
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.000]   I think the world is largely on board now
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.280]   that sleep is critical to our health,
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.980]   our mental health, our physical health, and our performance.
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.800]   But what's not often discussed is how great life is,
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.040]   that is, how much more focused and energetic
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.840]   and how positive our mood gets
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.720]   when we are sleeping for the appropriate amount of time
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.360]   at the appropriate depth
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.280]   and when we are doing that regularly.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.960]   Basically, everything in life gets better
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.780]   when we're sleeping well.
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.720]   So today, I'm going to teach you the tools
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.280]   that will allow you to optimize your sleep,
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.720]   that is, get to sleep and stay asleep,
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.360]   fall back asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night,
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.880]   and adjust your sleep given the various life demands
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.160]   you may be experiencing.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.040]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.360]   is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.600]   We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.300]   First of all, they ship internationally
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.200]   because we know that many of you are located
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.080]   outside of the United States, that's valuable.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.080]   Second of all, and perhaps most important,
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.640]   the quality of their supplements is second to none,
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.300]   both in terms of purity and precision
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.240]   of the amounts of the ingredients.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.880]   Third, we've really emphasized supplements
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.080]   that are single ingredient supplements
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.140]   and that are supplied in dosages
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.120]   that allow you to build a supplementation protocol
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.960]   that's optimized for cost,
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.820]   that's optimized for effectiveness,
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.960]   and that you can add things and remove things
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.300]   from your protocol in a way
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.000]   that's really systematic and scientific.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.340]   This is really hard to do
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.200]   if you're taking blends of different supplements
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.960]   or if the dosages are such that you can't titrate,
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.340]   or that is adjust the dosages of a given supplement.
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.980]   So by using single ingredient supplements,
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.660]   you can really build out the supplement kit
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.760]   that's ideal for you and your specific needs.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.940]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.280]   that we partner with Momentus on,
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.380]   you can go to livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.500]   There you'll see those supplements,
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.960]   and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.660]   the library of supplements available through Momentus
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.600]   on a regular basis.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.280]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.960]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.700]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.760]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.200]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.800]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.840]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.640]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.960]   Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.400]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.040]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.420]   to help you better meet your health goals.
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.840]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.240]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.300]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.640]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.180]   And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.000]   you can also get insight into, for instance,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.480]   what your biological age is
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.380]   and compare that to your chronological age.
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.120]   And of course, your biological age
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.400]   is really the age that counts.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.480]   The problem with a lot of blood tests
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.240]   and DNA tests out there however,
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.820]   is that you get information back
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.400]   about the levels of metabolic factors,
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.960]   lipids, hormones, et cetera,
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.800]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.320]   InsideTracker makes that all very easy to navigate.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.160]   They have a personalized platform.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.560]   So this is a web portal where you can go,
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.040]   you'll see the numbers from your blood tests and DNA tests,
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.440]   and then it will tell you, for instance,
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.800]   how you could adjust various aspects of your nutrition
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.760]   or your exercise or supplementation
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.240]   in order to bring those numbers
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.460]   into the ranges that are best for you.
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.840]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.660]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.200]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.160]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.660]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.240]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.400]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capabilities.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.800]   It turns out that your body temperature
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.760]   and your ability to fall and stay asleep
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.840]   are very closely related.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.640]   If your body does not drop by one to three degrees,
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.640]   you are simply not going to get into deep sleep
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.220]   or stay in deep sleep.
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.520]   And waking up, it also turns out,
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.840]   is related to body temperature.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.500]   Every time you wake up in the morning,
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.040]   your body is warming up in order to wake you up.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.600]   And this has an enormous number of hormonal and metabolic
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.480]   and other cascades that are vitally important,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.320]   not just to what happens while you sleep,
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.920]   but your health and your energy
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.640]   and focus throughout the day.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.640]   Eight Sleep is an incredible device.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.420]   It's one that I've been using for six months or so,
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.120]   and it's completely transformed my sleep.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.360]   And I already thought I was sleeping pretty well.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.560]   The way it works is that you can cool or heat your mattress
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.480]   according to different times throughout the night.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.160]   So for instance, you can cool your mattress
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.400]   if you tend to run warm,
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.500]   and that will help you fall and stay deeply asleep.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.580]   And then toward morning,
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.440]   you can have the mattress programmed,
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.360]   or I should say the mattress cover programmed
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.540]   so that you warm up your sleeping environment
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.680]   and you wake up when you want to wake up.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.240]   If you've been sleeping pretty well,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.480]   but waking up in the middle of the night,
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.600]   you might also find that by cooling your mattress
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.240]   even further toward the middle of your sleep bout,
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.080]   well, you'll stay in deep sleep much longer.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.300]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.900]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.760]   to check out the PodPro cover and save $150 at checkout.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.400]   Eight Sleep currently ships within the US, Canada,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.340]   and the United Kingdom.
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.740]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.940]   to save $150 at checkout.
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.920]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.200]   that has everything you need
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.000]   in order to get your brain and body to function at its best,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.820]   but none of the things you don't, in particular, sugar.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.420]   Electrolytes are vitally important
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.640]   to the way that your neurons, your nerve cells work,
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.600]   and indeed to the way that all the cells of your body work.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.040]   But your nervous system and your neurons
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.320]   particularly depend on electrolytes
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.200]   because you need the electrolytes,
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.120]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium in the proper ratios
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.400]   in order for those nerve cells
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.280]   to fire what are called action potentials,
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.920]   which are the electrical signals
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.180]   that allow your neurons to work
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.440]   and to allow you to do everything
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.880]   from remembering information
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.500]   to moving your muscles deliberately.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.940]   When you exercise, or even if you don't,
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.740]   you can get quite low on electrolytes,
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.120]   especially on a hot day, you can get dehydrated.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.640]   There are a lot of different ways
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.800]   to replenish your fluids and electrolytes,
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.520]   and there are a lot of different electrolyte drinks
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.120]   out there, but many of them contain a lot of sugar.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.760]   And some of those that don't contain a lot of sugar
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.100]   don't have the proper ratios
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.840]   of sodium, magnesium, and potassium.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.940]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.160]   you can go to Drink Element, that's lmnt.com/huberman,

[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.580]   Let's talk about sleep and tools to optimize your sleep.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.360]   I want you to conceptualize yourself
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.360]   as contained within a room that has only very few windows
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.320]   or very few entry points.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.160]   What do I mean by this?
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.540]   Well, your brain and your nervous system
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.920]   control whether or not you move or don't move.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.820]   They control whether or not you're digesting food
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.880]   or you're not digesting food.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.680]   They control whether or not you're stressed or not stressed,
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.540]   happy or sad, et cetera.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.040]   All of that stuff that controls all that stuff
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.760]   is housed inside your skin and skull, et cetera.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.520]   And that might seem pretty obvious,
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.500]   but what that means is that for your brain and body
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.300]   to feel alert and focused, ready to move and exercise
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.460]   or do some work, or if your brain and body
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.320]   are going to lie down and go to sleep,
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.980]   well, that brain and body needs cues.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.940]   It needs inputs to determine
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.780]   when to do those different things.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.880]   And those cues and inputs arrive through a defined set
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.060]   of what I'll call stimuli,
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.200]   but you can also think of these as levers or tools.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.260]   The main levers and tools that are going to allow you
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.600]   to control when you are awake and when you are asleep
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.520]   and to get better sleep every single night
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.040]   are light, literally photons, light energy,
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.960]   could be from sunlight, could be from artificial light.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.920]   We will discuss those particulars in a moment,
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.120]   as well as darkness.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.840]   That is the absence of light.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.360]   So we've got light and dark.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.220]   Those are two very powerful tools
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.620]   to encourage your nervous system to be in one state
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.420]   or another, meaning awake or asleep.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.040]   Temperature is another tool or lever.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.260]   Turns out that when your body is cooling down,
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.100]   you have a greater tendency to fall and stay asleep.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.140]   In fact, every night when you actually sleep,
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.500]   your body is dropping by one to three degrees,
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.560]   and that drop in temperature is required.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.100]   It's like a gate that your body has to go through
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.740]   in order for you to get into sleep.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.700]   And in fact, the converse is also true.
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.060]   If your body heats up by one to three degrees or so,
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.480]   you will wake up.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.480]   So you've got light, dark, temperature, food,
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.640]   and when we say food, we mean what we eat,
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.120]   when we eat, and the amount that we eat.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.380]   Okay, so light, dark, temperature, food, exercise,
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.700]   and of course, exercise comes in different forms.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.340]   We can do cardiovascular exercise.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.860]   That can be low intensity, long distance exercise.
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.440]   It can be high intensity,
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.460]   so-called high intensity interval training.
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.580]   It could be weight training, it could be yoga,
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.860]   it could be swimming, any number of different activities,
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.320]   but exercise in general causes an increase
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.280]   in body temperature and tends to make us more alert,
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.820]   not just during the exercise,
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.860]   but in the immediate hours after that exercise.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.140]   Exercise does some other things
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.380]   that relate to our sleep as well,
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.700]   and we'll talk about those today
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.100]   and how you can leverage them.
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.860]   Another potent lever for adjusting your sleepiness
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.940]   and wakefulness is caffeine.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.380]   This of course comes as no surprise to people,
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.300]   but why and how caffeine works
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.780]   might come as a surprise.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.400]   Very briefly, we have a molecule in our body
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.500]   called adenosine, and the longer we have been awake,
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.800]   the more adenosine builds up in our brain and body,
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.740]   and adenosine is part of the reason why we get sleepy.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.740]   Caffeine effectively operates as a adenosine antagonist.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.540]   It works by basically occupying the receptor for adenosine,
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.840]   so it's a little bit of a convoluted mechanism,
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.560]   but basically all you need to know
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.660]   is that caffeine prevents the actions of adenosine.
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.500]   That's one of the reasons why caffeine makes us feel alert,
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.000]   but how much caffeine we drink and when we drink caffeine
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.380]   turns out to be vitally important
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.800]   for adjusting our wakefulness and for optimizing our sleep,
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.100]   so we'll talk about that as well.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.820]   The other category of lever tools,
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.000]   which are immensely powerful for optimizing sleep,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.800]   are supplements.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.920]   There now exist as many as eight different supplements
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.360]   that can powerfully modulate sleep in healthy ways
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.920]   and that have huge margins for safety.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.340]   We're going to talk about what those supplements are.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.160]   In previous episodes of this podcast
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.460]   and as a guest on other podcasts,
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.420]   I've talked about three particular supplements,
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.540]   magnesium threonate, apigenin, and theanine,
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.020]   which together can really enhance the speed
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.300]   at which one falls asleep
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.620]   and people's ability to stay asleep
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.700]   and to really get into those deep stages of sleep
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.200]   that are particularly restorative.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.820]   Today, we're going to talk a little bit more
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.860]   about each of those three
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.220]   and how they can best be used in combination,
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.860]   but we are also going to touch on some other supplements
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.140]   that I have not talked about much before, if at all,
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.180]   things like glycine and GABA, as well as inositol.
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.660]   Many people are going to find inositol interesting
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.140]   and of particular use to them,
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.900]   especially if they're following a low carbohydrate diet
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.620]   or if they are fasting before sleep
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.440]   or just trying to avoid eating too close to bedtime
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.180]   and yet they're having a hard time falling asleep.
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.560]   Inositol also turns out to be especially useful
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.720]   for people who have a tendency to wake up
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.560]   in the middle of the night
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.380]   and have a hard time falling back asleep.
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.840]   It also has some interesting and potent effects
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.220]   on anxiety throughout the day.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.580]   So we're going to talk about inositol as a tool as well.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.720]   And then last in our list of general categories
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.140]   of levers and tools for optimizing sleep are digital tools.
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.700]   So we say digital tools, I don't necessarily mean devices.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.220]   What I mean are things like non-sleep deep rest scripts.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.220]   These are zero cost scripts that you listen to
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.340]   that take your body through some deep relaxation
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.000]   and that can help people both fall asleep, stay asleep,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.100]   fall back asleep, and get better at sleeping.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.380]   And also going to talk about digital tools
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.820]   related to self-hypnosis.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.220]   This is distinctly different from stage hypnosis.
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.080]   So I know some of you hear hypnosis and you think,
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.940]   oh, you know, people, you know, clucking like chickens
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.020]   and doing things that are outside their control.
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.660]   That's not at all what I'm referring to here.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.680]   I'm talking about clinically and research supported tools
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.560]   that have been shown to enhance people's ability
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.780]   to fall and stay asleep
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.160]   and that can get you far better at sleeping.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.940]   So again, to recap the list of levers and tools,
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.100]   we've got light and dark,
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.500]   and that includes the intensity of light,
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.700]   the timing of light, et cetera.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.020]   We've got temperature, we have food,
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:49.020]   we have exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital tools,
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.700]   not just limited to devices,
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.220]   but zero cost tools that you can access on YouTube
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.820]   and elsewhere in various apps
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.620]   that can really help you optimize your sleep.
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.260]   So today we're going to talk about all of these.
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.700]   I really want to provide you as many tools as possible,
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.460]   give you the logic behind each of those tools
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.620]   and when and how best to apply them
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.540]   so that you can develop the sleep toolkit
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.660]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.240]   As we head into our description
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.560]   of tools for optimizing sleep,
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.360]   let's consider what the perfect 24-hour cycle
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.920]   would look like.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.580]   Let's start this 24-hour cycle
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.340]   with when you wake up in the morning.
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.340]   So for some of you, that will be 5 a.m.,
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.360]   for others of you, that will be 10 a.m.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.580]   Most people, I believe, wake up sometime
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.700]   between 6.30 a.m. and 8.30 a.m.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.320]   But regardless of when you wake up in the morning,
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.940]   one of the first things that happens
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.780]   is that your body temperature is increasing
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.800]   and that's just going to happen naturally.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.400]   Some of it is going to be the consequence
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.020]   of your moving around a bit,
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.460]   but really the increase in body temperature
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.060]   is one of the main triggers
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.180]   for why you woke up in the first place.
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:55.020]   That increase in body temperature, in turn,
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.820]   causes an increase in the release
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.000]   of a hormone called cortisol.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.900]   Cortisol is often discussed as a stress hormone,
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.900]   but it's not just associated with stress.
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.500]   It also enhances your immune system,
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.780]   provided cortisol is elevated at the right times
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.700]   and the right time for cortisol to be elevated
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.940]   is when you first wake up in the morning.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.980]   That increase in cortisol
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.920]   is also going to increase metabolism.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.500]   It's also going to increase your ability to focus mentally
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.760]   and for you to move your body.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.880]   So again, cortisol is often demonized
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.140]   and considered this bad thing.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.960]   And indeed, you don't want cortisol to be chronically
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.720]   or consistently elevated throughout the day or night,
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.380]   but you do want cortisol to reach its peak early in the day,
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.860]   right about the time you wake up.
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.500]   One way that you can ensure
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.020]   that that cortisol peak occurs early in the day,
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.100]   right about the time that you wake up,
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.800]   is to view bright light, ideally from sunlight,
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.280]   within the first 30 to 60 minutes after waking.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.820]   That's right, view bright sunlight
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.880]   within the first 30 to 60 minutes after waking.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.260]   I'll get into all the caveats
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.500]   about what happens if you wake up before the sun is out,
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.460]   what if you live in the UK where there is no sun
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.580]   or people claim there is no sun,
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:12.100]   hate to tell you this, folks, but there is sun in the UK.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.380]   We'll talk about all that, but everybody,
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.380]   whether or not you live in a cloudy place or a sunny place,
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.980]   whether or not there's cloud cover or not that day,
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.080]   should really strive to get bright light in your eyes,
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.500]   ideally from sunlight,
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.140]   within the first 30 to 60 minutes after waking.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.580]   The reason for that is very simple.
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.660]   You want to trigger that cortisol increase
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:37.060]   to occur very early in your day.
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.540]   And you don't want that cortisol peak to happen later,
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.620]   which is what will happen if you wait
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.600]   to get outside and see sunlight.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.980]   The reason for this is that you have a set of neurons,
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.340]   nerve cells in your eye,
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.700]   they're called intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells,
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.580]   but you do not need to know that name.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.460]   Those neurons respond best to bright light,
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.740]   and especially right after waking early in the day,
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.760]   they are best able to signal to a set of neurons
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.720]   that reside over the roof of your mouth,
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.180]   called the suprachiasmatic nucleus,
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.180]   which is a cluster of neurons
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.040]   that then sends a huge number of other signals,
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.540]   electrical and chemical, out to your entire body
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.960]   that triggers that cortisol increase,
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.980]   provides a wake-up signal for your brain and body,
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.300]   and sets in motion a timer
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.460]   for you to fall asleep later that night.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.760]   So again, we're not trying to go
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.980]   into too much mechanism today.
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.820]   We are trying to really hammer on tools,
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.700]   and I'll substantiate those tools
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.560]   just a bit with some mechanism,
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.900]   but here's what you do, or at least here's what I do.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.220]   I wake up in the morning and I want to reach for my phone,
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.580]   but I know that even if I were to crank up the brightness
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.860]   on that phone screen,
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.120]   it's not bright enough to trigger that cortisol spike,
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.940]   and for me to be at my most alert and focused
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.020]   throughout the day and to optimize my sleep at night.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.860]   So what I do is I get out of bed and I go outside,
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.180]   and if it's a bright, clear day,
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.020]   and the sun is low in the sky,
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.020]   or the sun is starting to get overhead,
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.560]   what we call low solar angle,
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.620]   then I know I'm getting outside at the right time.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.180]   If there's cloud cover and I can't see the sun,
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.540]   I also know I'm doing a good thing because it turns out,
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.940]   especially on cloudy days,
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.040]   you want to get outside and get as much light energy
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.780]   or photons in your eyes.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.700]   But let's say it's a very clear day
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.820]   and I can see where the sun is.
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.620]   I do not need to stare directly into the sun.
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.580]   If it's very low in the sky, I might do that
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.880]   because it's not going to be very painful to my eyes.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.420]   However, if the sun is a little bit brighter
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.900]   and a little bit higher in the sky,
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.580]   sometimes it can be painful to look at.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.300]   So the way to get this sunlight viewing early in the day
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.980]   is to look toward the sun.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.320]   If it's too bright to look at directly,
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.300]   well, then don't do that.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.560]   You just look toward it, but not directly at it.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.720]   It's absolutely fine to blink.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.020]   In fact, I encourage you to blink
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.460]   whenever you feel the impulse to blink.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.200]   Never look at any light, sunlight or otherwise,
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.880]   that's so bright that it's painful to look at
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.520]   'cause you can damage your eyes.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.840]   But for this morning sunlight viewing,
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.880]   it's best to not wear sunglasses.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.260]   That's right, to not wear sunglasses,
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.000]   at least for this morning sunlight viewing.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.620]   It is absolutely fine to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses,
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.760]   so-called corrective lenses.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.840]   In fact, those will serve you well in this practice
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.700]   or this tool because they will focus the light
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.680]   onto your neural retina and onto those melanopsin
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.760]   and intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.160]   If your eyeglasses or contact lenses have UV protection,
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.320]   that's okay.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.740]   There's so many different wavelengths of light
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.420]   coming from the sun and they are bright enough
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.120]   that they will trigger the mechanisms
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.920]   that you want triggered at this early time of day.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.600]   So try and get outside,
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.420]   ideally within the first five minutes of waking,
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.240]   or maybe it's 15 minutes,
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.780]   but certainly within the first hour after waking.
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.940]   I want to share with you three critical things
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.260]   about this tool of morning sunlight viewing.
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.040]   First of all, this is not some woo biology thing.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.980]   This is grounded in the core of our physiology.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.120]   There are literally hundreds, if not thousands,
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.560]   of quality peer-reviewed papers
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.040]   showing that light viewing early in the day
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.740]   is the most powerful stimulus
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.220]   for wakefulness throughout the day,
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.840]   and it has a powerful positive impact
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.960]   on your ability to fall and stay asleep at night.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.920]   So this is really the foundational power tool
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.540]   for ensuring a great night's sleep
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.100]   and for feeling more awake during the day.
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.620]   Second of all, if you wake up before the sun is out,
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.340]   you can and probably should flip on artificial lights
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.760]   in your internal home environment or apartment
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.140]   or wherever you happen to live,
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.900]   if your goal is to be awake.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.100]   If you wake up at four in the morning
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:35.980]   and you need to be awake,
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.500]   well then turn on artificial lights.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.600]   Once the sun is out, however, once the sun has risen,
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.340]   then you still want to get outside and view sunlight.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:49.260]   Some of you will wake up before the sun comes out,
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.520]   and if you're asking whether or not
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.700]   turning on artificial lights
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.780]   can replace sunlight at those hours,
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.860]   unfortunately, the answer is no.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.520]   Unless you have a very special light,
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.300]   we'll talk about what kind of light,
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.300]   the bright artificial lights in your home environment
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.200]   are not, I repeat, are not going to be sufficiently bright
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.180]   to turn on the cortisol mechanism
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.700]   and the other wake-up mechanisms
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.040]   that you need early in the day.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.640]   The diabolical twist, however,
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.420]   is that those lights in your home or apartment
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.420]   or even on your phone are bright enough
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.460]   to disrupt your sleep if you look at them too late at night
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.700]   or in the middle of the night.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.620]   So there's this asymmetry in our retinal,
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.580]   our eye biology, and in our brain's biology,
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.600]   whereby early in the day, right around waking,
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.060]   you need a lot of light, a lot of photons,
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.180]   a lot of light energy,
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.400]   and artificial lights generally just won't accomplish
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.940]   what you need them to accomplish.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.980]   But at night, even a little bit of artificial light
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.460]   can really mess up your so-called circadian,
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.800]   your 24-hour clocks and all these mechanisms
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.900]   that we're talking about.
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.700]   So if you wake up before the sun is out
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.980]   and it's still dark,
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.660]   please turn on as many bright artificial lights
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.780]   as you possibly can or need,
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.060]   but then get outside once the sun is out.
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:06.440]   On cloudy days, you especially need to get outside.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.700]   I repeat, on cloudy days, overcast days,
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.760]   you especially need to get outside and get sunlight.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.220]   You just need to get more of it.
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.500]   Now, how much light and how much light viewing do you need?
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.660]   This is going to vary depending on person and place,
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.340]   literally where you live on earth,
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.420]   whether or not there's a lot of tree cover,
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.220]   whether or not you're somebody who has sensitive eyes
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.460]   or less sensitive eyes.
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.700]   It's really impossible for me
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.520]   to give an absolute prescriptive,
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.260]   but we can give some general guidelines.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.220]   In general, on a clear day,
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.080]   meaning no cloud cover or minimal cloud cover,
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.020]   you want to get this sunlight exposure to your eyes
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.620]   for about five minutes or so.
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.700]   It could be three minutes one day,
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.260]   it could be seven minutes the next day, about five minutes.
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.600]   On a day where there's cloud cover,
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.420]   so the sun is just peeking through the clouds
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.680]   or it's more dense cloud cover,
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.240]   you want to get about 10 minutes of sunlight exposure
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.680]   to your eyes early in the day.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.140]   And on days that are really densely overcast
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.440]   or maybe even a rainy,
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.600]   you're going to want to get as much as 20 or 30 minutes
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.660]   of sunlight exposure.
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.260]   Another key thing is do not forget about,
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.020]   just don't try and get this sunlight exposure
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.980]   through a windshield of a car or a window,
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.420]   whether or not it's tinted or otherwise.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.980]   It takes far too long.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.080]   It's simply not going to trigger the relevant mechanisms.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.380]   You would be standing there all day
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.140]   trying to get enough light into your eyes
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.060]   from the morning sunlight,
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.260]   and by then the sun will have already moved
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.280]   from low solar angle to overhead,
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.400]   and it simply won't work for all sorts of mechanisms
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.520]   related to your circadian rhythm functions.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.600]   So just don't try and do it
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.040]   through a windshield, sunglasses, or a window.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:40.980]   It's just not going to work.
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.020]   Get outside.
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.240]   If the weather is really bad or for whatever reason,
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.020]   safety reasons, you cannot get outside,
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.820]   well then I suppose try and get near a window.
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.880]   That would be the last, last resort,
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.840]   but you really want to get outside
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.740]   to get the sunlight exposure.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.840]   Now, if you live in a part of the world
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.940]   where it's extremely dark and overcast,
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.400]   or the weather won't let you outside,
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.700]   or you live in a cave or some other small box
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.060]   that does not allow any natural light into it
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.380]   for whatever reason,
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.020]   well then you're going to need a replacement
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.660]   for that sunlight.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.060]   And there are sunlight simulators or daylight simulators
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.080]   that you can purchase.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.940]   Those are quite expensive in general.
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.060]   And therefore I suggest cheaper options
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.060]   that work just as well because they get just as bright.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.600]   Things like ring lights that are sold
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.360]   in order for people to take selfies and this kind of thing.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.320]   A drawing LED tablet will work pretty well.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.160]   I actually have one of those
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.540]   and I put it on my desk all morning,
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.380]   even though I still get outside
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.580]   and look at sunlight first thing in the morning.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.620]   Again, also, especially I should say on cloudy days.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.960]   We do not have any affiliation to any ring lights
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.020]   or LED lights or these panels.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.660]   So we will provide a link to a couple of different options
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.200]   if you want to explore the various options.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.760]   I don't know what people's different budgets are.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.400]   I don't know where people live.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.100]   I just know that many of our listeners live
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.900]   in locations throughout the world where for instance,
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.480]   during the winter, it gets very, very dark,
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.260]   so they can't get sufficient sunlight.
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.220]   But get that morning light, ideally from sunlight,
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.060]   and take into account all the specific points
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.460]   that I've given you here.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.120]   And I should say, enjoy this practice.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.540]   It's really nice to get outside first thing in the morning
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.380]   and get the sunlight.
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.700]   In fact, when you start doing this,
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.160]   you'll notice that your body will start
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.060]   to feel more energized
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.540]   and it will feel more energized more quickly.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.020]   You'll actually start to notice this mechanism
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.060]   kicking in each day,
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.640]   especially if you're paying attention to your physiology.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.940]   So enjoy this practice of getting outside.
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.660]   Yes, you can take your morning beverage outside.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.580]   Yes, you can take your dog with you.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.560]   In fact, animals intuitively know
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.740]   to get this morning sunlight.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.840]   They actually seek it out at the right times of days.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.360]   We human beings need to be told by podcasters
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.900]   and other people about the science
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.600]   that supports these kinds of practices.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.120]   Our pets apparently do not.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.960]   But get outside alone or with somebody,
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.540]   with your kids, with your dog.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.080]   However you go about this practice,
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.980]   make sure you do this practice
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.140]   at least 80% of the days of your life.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:03.980]   That's right.
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.240]   If you miss a day, for instance,
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.080]   you're bedridden for a day,
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.100]   try and get next to a window.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.460]   Let's say you are traveling or for whatever reason,
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.140]   you are not able to get outside first thing in the morning.
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.820]   Well then try to get twice as much sunlight in your eyes,
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.180]   or I should say extend the duration of sunlight viewing
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.200]   in the morning for twice as long the following day.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.060]   This is a slow integrative mechanism
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.140]   that underlies this whole thing of wakefulness
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.700]   during the day and sleep at night due to sunlight viewing.
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.780]   And if you miss a day,
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:33.900]   you can make up for it the next day,
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.220]   but you have to get twice as much light
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.420]   or twice as much duration of light.
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.860]   If you really want to get technical
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:41.820]   and you really want to measure
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.180]   how much light is in your environment,
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.540]   you can download a free app, something like Light Meter,
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.940]   and that will allow your phone
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.660]   to act as a bit of a light meter
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.920]   and give you a pretty accurate measurement of how many lux,
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.580]   which is a measure of brightness,
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.500]   are in your environment in the morning.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.180]   And in general, that's just going to be a good tool
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.740]   for evaluating your environments.
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.180]   Here's what I suggest you do.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.460]   Wake up in the morning, take Light Meter,
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.300]   point it at the brightest light in your home
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.180]   and take a measurement.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.380]   And what you'll probably find is it's about 1,000 lux.
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.460]   Now go outside, and if there's some sunlight out
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.940]   and there's cloud cover, point it at the sky
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:17.780]   and press that button.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:18.660]   You can actually hold it down
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:22.140]   and it'll give you a dynamically updated lux measurement.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.460]   And what you'll find is like 5,000, 10,000,
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.460]   sometimes even 90,000 lux,
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.620]   even though you don't experience it as so much brighter.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.520]   And that's because an indoor artificial light
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.820]   is very concentrated over a small spatial area,
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.660]   whereas the sunlight is very diffuse.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.680]   But it's that diffuse, very bright sunlight,
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.360]   that photon energy that you really want
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.480]   that's going to set all the rhythms of your brain and body
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.860]   in the proper way, not just that cortisol peak,
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.140]   but it's going to trigger proper metabolism.
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.040]   It's going to set a timer for you to be able to fall asleep
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.760]   about 16 hours later and on and on and on.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.800]   And I should mention within the on and on and on,
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.640]   it's also going to suppress any melatonin,
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.720]   a hormone that makes you sleepy,
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.920]   that happens to be swimming around in your bloodstream
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.460]   at the time you wake up.
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.940]   It does a number of other things too,
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.000]   including interact with the adenosine system
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.880]   and kind of wash out some of the adenosine
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.200]   that might still be residual
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.600]   if you didn't sleep enough.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:15.180]   Fundamentally speaking, get that morning sunlight viewing.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.240]   I promise you will be grateful that you did.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.180]   It makes everybody feel better, feel more alert,
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.560]   and it will greatly assist with your ability
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.820]   to fall and stay asleep later that night.
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.560]   Before we continue with today's discussion,
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.160]   we're going to take a brief pause
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.680]   to acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens,
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.440]   also called AG1.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.740]   I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.160]   So I'm delighted that they've been a sponsor of this podcast.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.980]   Athletic Greens contains vitamins, minerals, probiotics,
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.700]   digestive enzymes, and adaptogens.
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.020]   So it's got a lot of things in there.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.660]   That's actually the reason I started taking it
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.320]   and the reason I still take it once or twice a day.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.460]   It essentially covers all of my nutritional bases
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.700]   and the probiotics in particular are important to me
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.020]   because of the critical importance
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.620]   of what's called the gut brain axis,
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.860]   that is neurons and other cell types in the gut,
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.400]   in the digestive tract that communicate with the brain
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.660]   and the brain back to the digestive tract
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.980]   in order to control things like mood,
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.020]   immune function, hormone function, and on and on.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.460]   Whenever somebody has asked me
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.620]   what's the one supplement they should take,
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.260]   I always answer Athletic Greens.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.660]   I gave that answer long before I ever had this podcast
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.420]   and it's the answer I still give now
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.220]   for all the reasons that I detailed just a moment ago.
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:25.600]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.460]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.760]   while you're on the road,
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.560]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2,
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.760]   which are also very important for a huge number
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.880]   of bodily factors and brain factors
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.780]   that impact your immediate and long-term health.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.400]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.780]   to claim that special offer.
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.160]   Okay, so now we're still focusing
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.060]   on this early part of the day when you've woken up,
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.140]   like the first hour or so after waking.
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.900]   And we can go to our list of other levers and tools, right?
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.240]   We have light and dark.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.560]   We already talked about light and sunlight in particular.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.920]   We've got temperature, food, exercise, caffeine,
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.180]   supplements, and digital tools.
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.460]   Now, once you've woken up and you want to be awake, okay?
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.700]   So this is likely to be early in the day
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.240]   if you're following a more standard schedule.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.420]   You will also want to leverage not just light,
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.880]   but temperature as a tool.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.660]   If you are inclined, it would be wise
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.540]   to try and increase your core body temperature
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.460]   a bit more quickly than it would otherwise
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.880]   if you were to just shuffle around outside,
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.980]   get your sunlight, maybe read a little bit, et cetera.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.740]   And there are two main ways you can do that.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:40.980]   The first way is to get into cold water of some sorts.
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.100]   This could be a cold shower
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.620]   of anywhere from one to three minutes.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:45.900]   This could be an ice bath.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.220]   If that's your thing, it could be a cold tub,
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.700]   or if you own a cold tub that's specifically designed
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:55.360]   for deliberate cold exposure, get under some cold water.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.660]   That will certainly wake you up.
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.500]   And if you've ever jumped into cold water
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.700]   or had a cold shower, you know it really wakes you up
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.940]   because you release adrenaline epinephrine
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.460]   from both your brain and body.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.000]   The body from your adrenals and your brain
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.380]   from a little cluster of neurons called locus coeruleus.
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.860]   Again, the names don't matter.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.620]   One to three minutes of cold water exposure
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.900]   will wake you up because of that adrenaline release.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.700]   And, and I want to highlight the and,
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.500]   it will serve to increase your core body temperature.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.640]   That's right.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.020]   Your body and brain interact
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.600]   as a bit of a thermostat system
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.900]   where if you put something cold on the surface of your body,
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.720]   your brain, a little cluster of neurons
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:35.140]   in the so-called medial preoptic area act as a thermostat
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.620]   and say, ah, the external of my body is cold
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.460]   and therefore I'm going to heat up my core body temperature.
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.720]   So this is a little bit paradoxical.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.200]   People think, oh, if you get into cold water or an ice bath,
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.520]   your body temperature is going to drop.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.380]   And indeed that's true if you stay in for a while,
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.340]   but if you just get in for about one to three minutes
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.480]   or under the cold shower for one to three minutes,
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.140]   your core body temperature will increase.
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.420]   So then when you get out of that cold water,
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.100]   your body temperature is increasing at a rate,
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.180]   at a slope that's steeper than it would otherwise,
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.340]   and you're going to feel more alert.
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.900]   It also has the advantage of increasing,
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.900]   not just adrenaline, but dopamine,
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.380]   which is a molecule involved in motivation, focus, et cetera.
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.180]   So this is great for waking up.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.280]   So we've got sunlight,
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.400]   we've got temperature triggered by cold water,
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.780]   and we have exercise.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.940]   One of the best ways to increase your core body temperature
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.060]   early in the day is to do exercise.
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.900]   Now, some of you might choose
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.820]   to do your full-blown workout for the day
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.240]   first thing when you wake up in the morning.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.900]   I always say the best time to exercise,
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.700]   at least what the research points to,
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.140]   is immediately when you wake up in the morning
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.900]   or three hours after waking or 11 hours after waking.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.580]   But that's really getting down into optimization
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.820]   for sake of muscular strength and grip strength.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:47.340]   And it's very hard to give a strict prescriptive.
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.400]   Here's what I suggest.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.440]   If you want to be alert early in the day
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.700]   and you want to sleep great at night,
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.540]   get that bright sunlight, get into some cold water.
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.800]   And if you don't want to get into some cold water,
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.180]   try and get some movement.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.620]   It could be a walk so you can get your sunlight exposure
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.260]   while you're taking a walk first thing in the morning.
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.420]   It could be a light jog.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.020]   It could be skipping rope.
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.540]   These days, I skip rope for about 10 minutes or 20 minutes
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.760]   while looking at the sun.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.460]   So I'm trying to layer in these different things
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.300]   for waking up.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.940]   And then I take a cold shower afterwards.
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.060]   That's what I've been doing as of lately,
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.140]   but I don't do that all year long necessarily.
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.220]   Or some of you are going to be working out mid-morning.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.740]   I sometimes do that.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:26.980]   But try and get your core body temperature increased
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.140]   first thing in the morning.
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:31.140]   And a great way to do that is with the cold water
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:33.340]   and/or with exercise.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.720]   And again, it doesn't have to be your full-blown workout
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.920]   for the day if you're doing workouts consistently,
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.980]   which I hope everybody is
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.180]   because everybody really should exercise
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:43.500]   at least I believe five or six
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.580]   or maybe even seven days a week.
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.580]   For me, it's six days a week, sometimes five.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.100]   Rarely is it seven.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.980]   So get that exercise or even just a modest amount
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.740]   of movement, walking, jogging, skipping rope,
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:55.340]   some light calisthenics.
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.300]   That will further increase your core body temperature
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.880]   and help you feel more awake.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.600]   Then we have the category of caffeine.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.300]   And again, we're just talking about this early part
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.140]   of the day.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:03.980]   And you might be saying, "Wait a second.
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.380]   "I thought this was an episode about tools for sleep."
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.980]   Well, everything that we're talking about doing
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.280]   in these first 60 to 90 minutes of the day
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.620]   really set in motion a wave of biological cascades
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.180]   that carry through the entire day and into the evening
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.820]   and into the night and really do serve to optimize sleep.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.620]   So just hang in there with me.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.260]   And for those of you that are interested in focus
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.860]   and attention, your ability to learn,
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.820]   all of these tools and practices are going to greatly
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.660]   enhance those as well.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.580]   So the next category of tool for use early in the day
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:34.420]   is caffeine.
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.200]   Caffeine is a very important compound to think about.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.900]   I do realize that some people who are prone to anxiety,
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.720]   especially panic attacks, anxiety attacks,
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.280]   might avoid caffeine entirely.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.100]   That's absolutely fine.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.780]   You do not have to drink caffeine.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.220]   So what I'm about to describe are ways to leverage caffeine
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.920]   use to optimize sleep and wakefulness
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.260]   if you are comfortable with caffeine, if you like caffeine.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.380]   I happen to love caffeine.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.020]   I like it in the form of coffee or espresso
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.540]   or yerba mate tea,
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.860]   in particular non-smoked varieties of yerba mate teas.
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.460]   Non-smoked because the smoked varieties seem to carry
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.700]   some carcinogenic, some cancer causing risk.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.000]   There's increasing data on that.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.640]   So non-smoked varieties of yerba mate.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.220]   So caffeine is something that a lot of people consume early
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.500]   in the day.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.780]   How much depends on your tolerance.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.900]   And there's a lot of individual variability here.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.340]   Again, caffeine is adenosine antagonist
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:27.740]   or effectively works as adenosine antagonist
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:28.900]   and limits sleepiness.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.700]   I highly recommend that everybody delay their caffeine
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:34.740]   intake for 90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.060]   However painful it may be to eventually arrive
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.900]   at that 90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.060]   You want, and I encourage you to clear out
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.060]   whatever residual adenosine is circulating in your system
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.260]   in that first 90 to 120 minutes of the day,
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.900]   get that sunlight exposure, get some movement to wake up
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:55.200]   and then, and only then start to ingest caffeine.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.420]   Because what you'll do if you delay caffeine intake
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.060]   until 90 to 120 minutes after waking
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.520]   is you will avoid this so-called afternoon crash.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.820]   And you may still get a little bit of dip in energy
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.220]   in the afternoon, but it's not going to be
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.540]   that massive crash.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.940]   I've talked about the reasons for that crash
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.340]   on previous episodes, but if you delay your caffeine intake
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.020]   90 to 120 minutes after waking,
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.420]   you are doing yourself a great service
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:21.340]   towards wakefulness and to avoid the crash.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.500]   And the afternoon crash has another liability to it,
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.820]   which is typically people will emerge
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:27.540]   from that afternoon crash, either grumpy or groggy,
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.420]   and then they'll lean into drinking more caffeine,
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.740]   which can then disrupt their sleep.
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:35.580]   So wait 90 to 120 minutes after waking in the morning
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.840]   to drink caffeine.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:41.120]   And if you drink caffeine at any point throughout the day,
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.220]   really try and avoid any caffeine.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.220]   Certainly avoid drinking more than 100 milligrams
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.660]   of caffeine after 4 p.m.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.460]   And probably even better to limit your last caffeine intake
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.620]   to 3 p.m. or even 2 p.m.
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.380]   And for many people shifting that caffeine intake
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.560]   from immediately after waking in the morning
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.780]   to 90 to 120 minutes gives them a much longer arc
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:02.860]   of energy throughout the day.
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:06.180]   And they don't feel the need to drink more caffeine
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.600]   later in the afternoon.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.860]   If you do drink caffeine later in the afternoon,
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.700]   really try and limit the total amount or drink decaf.
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.880]   Certainly keep the total amount
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.100]   to less than 100 milligrams if you are interested
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.800]   in getting into the best possible sleep.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.660]   And I say this knowing that many people,
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.480]   including myself can drink a double espresso
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.380]   with 200 milligrams of caffeine or more at 5 p.m.
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.820]   or even 6 p.m. or after dinner and still quote unquote,
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.900]   fall asleep fine or still sleep fine.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.540]   However, there are terrific data.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.660]   Matt Walker and I talked about this
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.860]   and there are more and more papers all the time
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.920]   that point to the fact that caffeine intake late in the day
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.540]   after 4 p.m. that is can really disrupt
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:46.640]   the architecture of your sleep.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.060]   So you might think you're sleeping well,
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.940]   but you're not sleeping nearly as well as you could
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:53.020]   if you avoided caffeine in those afternoon hours.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.020]   Now, some of you might be doing your main bout of exercise
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.080]   first thing in the morning and you want your caffeine
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.720]   before that bout of exercise.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.200]   In that case, I say, go for it.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.800]   Drink your caffeine, do your workout right after waking up.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.660]   I don't have a problem with that.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.660]   You will find however,
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.380]   that you're going to get an early afternoon dip in energy
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.860]   and that dip in energy is going to be substantial
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.900]   because it's going to be a dip in energy
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.860]   that naturally follows that workout from the morning.
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.280]   So it's dependent on temperature
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.940]   and it's going to be related to the elimination
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.780]   of that adenosine blockade by caffeine.
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.900]   So you're getting a kind of a one, two punch
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.560]   on your energy levels by taking a lot of caffeine
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.620]   and exercising early in the day.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.900]   You can sort of expect that you're going to get
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.160]   a drop in energy in the early afternoon.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.920]   That's okay if that's works for you,
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.620]   but just know that delaying that caffeine 90 to 120 minutes
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.200]   after waking would be the ideal scenario
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.740]   most days and most scenarios.
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:55.660]   All that said, I absolutely respect the fact
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.980]   that people have different work schedules,
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.000]   kids schedules, et cetera.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.760]   So if you want to do some or none or all these tools,
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.600]   that's really up to you.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.160]   I'm just providing them to you in the simplest form
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.600]   that I can possibly provide them.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.700]   Now, the other lever or tool that you have available to you
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.620]   is food, not just what you eat, but when you eat.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.700]   And it turns out that if you eat early in the day,
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.140]   you support a biological clock mechanism
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:24.220]   that will make you more alert early in the day.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.180]   That said, many people choose to fast
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.860]   in the early morning hours of the day
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.020]   or in the first part of the day.
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:29.900]   I'm one such person.
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.640]   I generally don't ingest any food
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.200]   until about 11 AM or 12 noon.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.740]   Sometimes I'll have a protein shake.
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.100]   Sometimes I'll have some almonds.
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.240]   Sometimes I'll have breakfast.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.840]   If people are meeting for brunch or breakfast,
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.200]   I will have breakfast for social reasons.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.620]   Every once in a while, but most of the time,
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.540]   I don't eat until about lunchtime.
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.040]   However, some people are really hungry
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.160]   when they wake up in the morning.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.160]   Just know that if you eat early in the day,
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.620]   you are further triggering an increase in metabolism
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.980]   and in temperature that will make you more alert.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.120]   So you don't have to eat early in the day,
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.180]   but you can start to see how these different tools
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.800]   layer together, sunlight viewing, exercise, cold water,
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.860]   eating, many of them are converging on the same mechanisms.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.920]   In fact, when you drink caffeine,
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.120]   there's also a small increase in body temperature
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.540]   due to the adrenaline increase that it stimulates.
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.500]   So all of these things can be layered on top of one another,
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.960]   or you can use them individually
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.340]   or think about them individually.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.240]   Now, food is an interesting lever or tool
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.760]   because it's not just about when you eat,
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.740]   but it's also about what you eat.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:31.620]   And I've talked a lot about eating for energy
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.600]   and what that means in terms of caloric energy
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.480]   versus neural energy, et cetera,
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.080]   in previous podcast episodes.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.340]   We're not going to focus on that now
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.380]   because frankly, to get into a description
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.460]   of whether or not somebody should eat fruits or vegetables
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.260]   or animal proteins or dairy, et cetera, early in the day,
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.340]   that's very nuanced.
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.660]   What you eat for your breakfast
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.300]   or if you choose to not eat breakfast is really up to you.
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.540]   All that said, if you eat a very large meal,
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.780]   it doesn't matter if you slept terrifically well
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.280]   10 hours the night before,
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.140]   or if you are about to go to sleep,
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.020]   or if it's the middle of the afternoon,
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.100]   if your gut is full of food,
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.140]   there's just a large volume of food in your gut,
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.060]   it's going to divert a lot of blood
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.440]   and other critical resources
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.120]   away from other organs of your body,
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.560]   in particular, your brain,
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.900]   and you're going to be sleepy after eating a big meal.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.240]   So this is sort of a duh,
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.720]   but I think oftentimes in the discussions
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.440]   about what to eat for energy,
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:26.560]   people neglect to consider food volume as a strong parameter
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.360]   or variable in that discussion.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.720]   So if you eat a huge breakfast,
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.820]   it's likely that you are going to be tired
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.460]   immediately after eating that breakfast,
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.680]   unless of course you exercise very hard prior to that
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.620]   and you metabolize all that food very quickly.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.240]   So it's up to you whether or not
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.300]   to eat first thing in the morning or not,
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.360]   but if you do eat in the first few hours of the morning,
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.240]   just understand that you are setting
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.260]   or you're helping to set a food-entrained,
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:52.600]   as it's called, circadian clock.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.620]   Light, temperature, timing of food intake,
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.120]   movement and exercise,
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:02.440]   all of these things literally funnel in in a neural sense,
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.240]   they funnel into this thing
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.560]   that we call the circadian clock,
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:09.080]   and they let that clock, that set of neurons predict
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.680]   when you are likely to be eating and active
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.200]   and viewing sunlight the next day
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.440]   and the next day and the next day.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.120]   I say all this because there are some beautiful studies
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.460]   and I'll highlight one again in the show note captions
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.760]   that show that if people are having a hard time
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.160]   waking up in the morning,
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.840]   one of the things they can do is maximize sunlight viewing,
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.160]   exercise in the morning, drink caffeine,
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.720]   although again, I support the idea
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.760]   that that would best be done about 90 to 120 minutes
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:39.020]   after waking, eating some food
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.300]   in those early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.040]   You can layer in multiple levers or tools
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.680]   in order to be more alert.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.580]   And that's what these levers and tools are really there for
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:52.680]   in this sense of what we're talking about today,
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.280]   which is optimizing sleep.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.640]   Yes, they will make you more alert.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.980]   Yes, they will provide some adrenaline and dopamine,
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.380]   for instance, the cold water, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.700]   But the reason we're talking about these things
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:06.620]   in the context of sleep is that they start to give your body
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.620]   some predictable autonomic timing.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.620]   What is predictable autonomic timing?
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.860]   Well, your autonomic nervous system
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.220]   is the components of your brain and body
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:18.180]   that cause wakefulness and sleepiness.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.160]   And you can start to create some predictability
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.620]   in that autonomic timing.
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.980]   You can start to do things that really make it such
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:28.200]   that you naturally wake up at six in the morning
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.120]   or five in the morning.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.280]   That's right, if you're somebody who naturally
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.120]   is a night owl who likes to stay up
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.460]   until two in the morning and sleep until 10 a.m.
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.620]   and you now have a job or you have to go to school
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:40.200]   or you have a partner that likes to get up early
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.100]   and go to sleep early, well, you can make that happen
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.320]   and you can make that happen pretty painlessly
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:49.260]   if you take a week or so and go to sleep 30 minutes
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.700]   or an hour earlier each night, set an alarm
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:56.080]   and wake up 30 minutes or an hour earlier each morning
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.140]   until of course you're waking up
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:58.120]   at the time you want to wake up.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:02.180]   And then even in that groggy state, get some exercise,
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.320]   get some sunlight viewing.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.140]   If the sun's not out, turn on those bright artificial lights
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.220]   have some breakfast, even if you're not hungry.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.140]   In fact, for those of you that engage in shift work
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:14.020]   because you have to or travel and you're jet lagged,
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.200]   one of the quickest ways to shift your circadian clock
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.500]   and get onto the local schedule
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.620]   is to eat on the local schedule.
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:24.700]   So what all these tools do is they really set up a cascade.
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.260]   Think of it as kind of a wave front
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.320]   of wakefulness and focus throughout the day.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.660]   It'll take you through the middle of the day
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.460]   and the afternoon stages we'll talk about in a few minutes,
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:35.160]   but really they take you to this period
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.660]   that is about 5 p.m. until your bedtime.
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.500]   I realize some people are going to bed very early,
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.480]   like 8 p.m. or 9 p.m., which to me seems very early,
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.860]   but very few people go to sleep at 5 p.m., right?
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.500]   Unless you're doing that for shift work or other reasons.
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:52.660]   But from 5 p.m. until bedtime is really a critical period
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.000]   in which you need to leverage particular tools
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.260]   in order to get and stay asleep optimally
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.860]   and to be able to sleep through the night.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.700]   So really there are three critical periods
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.460]   throughout each 24 hour cycle.
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.220]   And during each of those critical periods,
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.560]   you're going to want to do as many specific things
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.200]   as you can to optimize your wakefulness and focus
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:15.100]   and mood throughout the day and your sleep at night.
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.260]   The first critical period is the one
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.880]   that we've been talking about up until now.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.900]   Things like morning sunlight, viewing caffeine,
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.920]   90 to 120 minutes after waking, exercise, and so on.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.580]   We can call that critical period one.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.640]   And it really encompasses the time from which you wake up
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.160]   until about three hours after waking.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.440]   Although I should just mention,
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.360]   'cause there are always those people that say,
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:33.780]   "Wait, I wake up at 4 a.m.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.740]   and the sun isn't out until 8 a.m."
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.160]   Okay, so it might be four hours,
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:41.100]   but really it's those early morning hours of your day
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:42.420]   once you're awake.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:46.060]   The second critical period is the time throughout the day
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.360]   and afternoon leading into evening.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.200]   So you may ask,
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.980]   what are the things that you can do throughout the day,
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.720]   the middle of your day and into the afternoon
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.620]   and evening hours that are really going to set you up
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.220]   for the best possible sleep later that night?
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:00.340]   Well, there are a few dos and there are a few don'ts.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:03.700]   First of all, be careful about ingesting too much caffeine
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:04.660]   throughout the middle of the day.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.260]   That's kind of an obvious one for the reasons
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.060]   that we talked about earlier.
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.940]   Second of all, if you are a napper,
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.820]   and I raise my hand now, for those of you listening,
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:15.180]   I'm raising my right hand because I love naps.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.460]   I've always loved naps.
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:20.720]   Nowadays I do NSDR or a reverie sleep hypnosis
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.260]   almost every day.
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:23.920]   And I tend to do that as I mentioned
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.900]   in the early afternoon hours if I'm feeling kind of sleepy,
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.400]   because even though I optimize my caffeine intake timing,
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.300]   et cetera, I tend to get a little sleepy in the afternoon.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.140]   Most people get a little sleepy in the afternoon.
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.580]   Some of that is related to hitting
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.080]   that peak of body temperature.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:37.920]   And you might think, wait,
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.640]   I thought high body temperature
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.420]   is associated with alertness.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.520]   And it is, but right as you crest that high body temperature
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.220]   and your body temperature starts to drop,
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:47.960]   there's a tendency to be a little bit sleepy.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.100]   So some of you might opt to take a nap in the afternoon.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.940]   Should you nap, should you not nap?
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.500]   That's a question that I get asked a lot
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.060]   and that I asked Dr. Matthew Walker
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.640]   when he was a guest on this podcast.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.500]   Here was his answer and here's what the data support.
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.100]   It is fine to nap in the afternoon,
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.560]   but don't nap so late in the day or for so long
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.900]   that it disrupts your ability to fall
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.700]   and stay asleep at night for your major sleep bout.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.260]   Okay, so naps are fine,
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.360]   but don't sleep so long during the day
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.120]   or too late in the day that it disrupts your ability
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.060]   to fall and stay asleep.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:23.340]   I should also say you do not have to nap.
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:25.320]   It's kind of an interesting phenomenon that happens
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.900]   on these podcasts and on social media
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.020]   where we'll talk about naps
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:29.300]   and the fact that naps are great
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.940]   and don't make them longer than 90 minutes,
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:34.420]   but then all the non-nappers get really worried like,
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.500]   wait, am I supposed to nap?
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.180]   I don't like naps, I wake up groggy.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.500]   You do not have to nap.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.260]   In fact, if you can make it through your whole day
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.180]   without napping, great, more power to you.
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.760]   But if you do nap and you find that naps serve you well,
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.540]   keep those naps shorter than 90 minutes
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:50.400]   for reasons related to ultradian cycles and so forth.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.460]   And make sure that you don't nap too late in the day
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.260]   that you are then staying up too late at night
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:57.660]   and having a hard time waking up the next morning.
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.780]   I will say that for a lot of people who do not like naps
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:04.040]   or that find they wake up really grumpy from naps
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.020]   or groggy from naps,
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:09.640]   I encourage you to try the Reverie app,
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.900]   try an NSDR script, try yoga nidra,
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.140]   try something of that sort
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.980]   for anywhere from 10 to 20 to 30 minutes.
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.080]   I tend to do this every day.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.460]   Now I'll just lie down and I love yoga nidra,
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.300]   I love NSDR scripts, I love using the Reverie app.
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.980]   In particular, the portion of the Reverie app
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.580]   that gets you better at sleeping,
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.900]   it really is beneficial for me
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.680]   because it serves as very replenishing
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.140]   while I'm doing that hypnosis,
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.140]   but it's also gotten me much better at falling
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.780]   and staying asleep and falling back asleep
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.060]   in the middle of the night.
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.220]   So this critical period throughout the day
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:44.060]   is one in which most people are doing a lot of stuff.
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.600]   They're emailing and picking up kids and they're exercising
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.740]   and they're commuting and doing all sorts of things,
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.720]   taking phone calls and zooms, et cetera.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.340]   But if you can get that period of deep relaxation
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.660]   through a nap or NSDR, that's going to serve you well.
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.220]   Try not to drink too much caffeine,
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:01.340]   certainly no more than 100 milligrams of caffeine
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.460]   after 4 p.m. if your goal is to fall asleep
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.320]   at a reasonably normal time.
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:08.800]   And for those of you that exercise in the afternoon,
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.180]   understand that if you exercise very intensely,
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.720]   so this might be weight training or running
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.860]   or some other very intense exercise,
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.940]   typically that's going to further increase
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.360]   your body temperature.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.200]   Makes sense, right?
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.700]   Based on everything we know about metabolism
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:22.540]   and body temperature.
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:26.220]   And it's going to so-called delay your circadian clock.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.220]   It's going to make it such that you want to fall asleep
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.980]   a little bit later, maybe even a lot later.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:34.760]   So if you're exercising in the afternoon or evening,
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.180]   and that's the only time you can exercise
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.840]   or that's the time that you prefer to exercise, great,
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.460]   but be careful about ingesting too much caffeine
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:43.340]   in order to get the energy to do that exercise
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.740]   'cause that caffeine will disrupt your sleep.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:49.660]   And just know that you are delaying your circadian clock.
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:51.880]   You are making it such that you will naturally
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.780]   want to go to sleep later and wake up later.
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.760]   Contrast that with if you exercise early in the day,
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.580]   say immediately after waking up
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:03.940]   or in the first zero to four hours after waking.
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:05.880]   In most cases, that's not going to shift
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.560]   your circadian clock much.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.100]   And toward the end of the episode,
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:12.020]   we'll talk a little bit about forced exercise
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.480]   prior to wake up times.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:14.980]   That doesn't mean doing exercise in your sleep.
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:16.440]   That means deliberately setting an alarm
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.900]   and getting out of bed much earlier than you naturally would.
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:21.160]   That turns out to be a very potent tool
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:25.780]   to so-called advance your circadian clock.
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:28.260]   So we can talk about that a little bit later in the episode.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:31.500]   But this critical period too in the middle of the day
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.960]   is when you're going to want to leverage specific tools.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:37.460]   And we've talked about those, limiting caffeine intake,
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:40.960]   being mindful of the clock delaying effects of exercise,
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.380]   the fact that also if you're going to nap,
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:47.620]   you don't want to nap too long or too late into the day.
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:49.580]   Otherwise it'll disrupt your nighttime sleep.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:53.420]   So this critical period two or second critical period,
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:54.940]   I should say, during the middle of the day
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:56.900]   is a time in which you should be doing certain things
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.380]   and avoiding doing certain things.
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:51:59.720]   So that raises the question of whether or not
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.740]   you should also be getting a lot of light
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:03.700]   in particular sunlight throughout the day.
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.360]   Now, that's something that hasn't been explored too much
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.340]   in the literature until recently when Dr. Samara Tarr,
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:10.700]   who's the director of the chronobiology unit
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.240]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.700]   has decided to do a number of experiments,
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.780]   exploring the effects of light on mood
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.560]   and other aspects of brain function and body function
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.340]   when that light is delivered, not just in the morning,
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:22.860]   which is great for us, but also throughout the day.
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.900]   So should you be looking at sunlight
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:27.540]   or bright artificial lights throughout the day?
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:29.040]   Now on the face of it, you might just think,
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.480]   yes, you know, sunlight's great.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.300]   Provided we're not getting a sunburn
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.780]   and we're not staring at the sun and damaging our eyes,
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.100]   we should get as much sunlight as we possibly can.
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:39.620]   In fact, we talked about this in the episode on hormones,
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.760]   about how getting light onto as much of our skin
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.880]   as we can throughout the day can really help
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.700]   in the production of testosterone and estrogen
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:48.260]   in both men and women in healthy ways
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:51.320]   that improves mood and libido and all sorts of things
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.760]   that are associated with wellbeing.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.300]   However, because light is such a powerful stimulus
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.100]   for controlling the timing of your sleepfulness
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.380]   or sleepiness, I should say, and wakefulness,
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.240]   we might want to be cautious about how much light
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:06.140]   we are viewing in the afternoon,
[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:09.080]   in particular in the early evening hours, right?
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:12.020]   Well, it turns out it's not so straightforward.
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.400]   Viewing, so sunlight to the eyes,
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.220]   sunlight in the late afternoon and evening hours.
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.800]   So again, depends on time of year,
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.100]   depends on location that you happen to be in,
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.440]   but getting some sunlight in your eyes for, again,
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.520]   maybe five or 10, maybe 30 minutes,
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.460]   depending on how much cloud cover there is,
[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:30.720]   doing that in the afternoon serves
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.220]   an additional beneficial purpose,
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:37.840]   which is you protect or you inoculate your nervous system
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.940]   against some of the negative effects
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:44.500]   of bright artificial light or even dim artificial light
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.380]   in the nighttime hours between 10 PM and 4 AM,
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:49.300]   which is really critical period three.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.780]   And we'll talk about what to do and what to not do
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:54.820]   during critical period three of every 24 hour cycle.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:57.380]   But to make it very clear what I'm saying here,
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.380]   get that morning sunlight in your eyes,
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:01.460]   but also get some sunlight in your eyes
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:03.700]   in the late afternoon and evening hours
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.740]   when the sun is at so-called low solar angle,
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:07.840]   when it starts to descend in the sky.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.720]   Again, you don't have to stare directly at the sun,
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.580]   although if you can catch a nice, beautiful sunset,
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:12.420]   go for it.
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:15.360]   But as the sun starts to descend,
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:19.280]   it triggers those same neurons in your eye
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.100]   that communicate with your circadian clock,
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:24.140]   but it communicates with a different component
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:26.340]   or different compartment within the circadian clock.
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:28.560]   That circadian clock is not just one thing,
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:29.940]   it's multiple things, and you have what are called
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:32.080]   morning oscillators and evening oscillators.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.820]   And to make a long story short,
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:37.540]   the tool that I'm describing of looking at the sun
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:39.500]   in the late afternoon and evening,
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:42.700]   again, blinking is fine, don't stare at the sun,
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:43.980]   but getting that sunlight in your eyes
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:48.380]   in the late afternoon and evening signals to that clock
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.980]   that it's evening time and that sleep is coming.
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:56.460]   It also serves as a second anchor or reference point
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:59.860]   for your body and your brain to know where it is in time.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.500]   Remember back to the beginning of the episode,
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.200]   when I said your brain and your body
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.440]   and all your organs are locked inside this skin
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.420]   and the skull, and they don't know what's going on
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:08.340]   in the outside world.
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:10.000]   Well, that morning sunlight viewing
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.860]   and the other things you do during critical period one,
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:15.420]   those provide one strong set of signals
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.060]   that it's wake up time and time to be alert
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.320]   and time to be focused.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.180]   And then in the evening,
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.180]   by getting sunlight in your eyes again,
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.860]   and in particular sunlight
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.820]   that comes from low solar angle sunlight,
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.840]   well, that provides a second stimulus
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.040]   or a second reference point that tells your brain and body,
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.700]   hey, it's evening, the sun is descending.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:36.540]   And you might say, wait,
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:38.980]   how does the brain and these neurons know the difference
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:40.540]   between morning light and evening light?
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:43.140]   It turns out has to do with the particular wavelengths
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:46.180]   of light that are present in morning versus evening.
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:47.820]   It's an incredible mechanism.
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:50.740]   And you are probably familiar with the fact
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:52.740]   that when the sun is directly overhead,
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.520]   it's really bright white and yellow,
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:56.780]   and the sky's often blue.
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:57.720]   And if there's cloud cover,
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.580]   it just comes through as a bunch of bright light.
[00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:00.980]   Well, next time you're out in the morning,
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:02.660]   take a look at what a sunrise looks like.
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.880]   There's a lot of yellow-blue contrast.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.200]   And those yellow-blues signal important specific sets
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.620]   of cells in your eye and brain that it's morning.
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:13.100]   In the evening, you're also going to see yellow and blue,
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:16.460]   but the ratio of yellows and blues has now changed.
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:17.760]   And you also see some oranges.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.660]   And in a really brilliant sunset, you'll see some reds.
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.320]   If you haven't noticed this already,
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:23.440]   you'll really want to look for this.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.900]   It's like kind of fun and cool to look at.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:28.820]   Well, those yellows and blues and oranges
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.340]   that you see in the evening sunsets,
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.200]   those signal to your brain and body
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.660]   that evening is there and that nighttime is coming.
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:37.640]   And they're really establishing a second reference point
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.960]   or wave front of biological signals
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:42.440]   that are going to optimize your nighttime hours
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:45.120]   and your transition into really terrific sleep.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:47.100]   So now let's talk about what I'm calling
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:50.140]   critical period three of each 24-hour cycle.
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:53.000]   So this would be the period of time of late evening.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.560]   So it might be 6 p.m. for some,
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.620]   depending on when you go to sleep or 7 p.m.,
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:00.840]   extending into the hours in which you decide
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.280]   to get into bed and go to sleep
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:03.880]   and then throughout the night.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:05.760]   There are a number of things that you're going to want to do
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.200]   and there are a number of things
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.360]   that you are going to want to avoid doing
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.220]   in order to optimize your sleep.
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.860]   First of all, you're going to want to avoid
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:18.060]   bright artificial lights of any color.
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:20.040]   Yes, of any color.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.700]   We haven't talked a lot about blue blockers,
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:23.820]   you know, lenses that block blue wavelengths
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:26.180]   or short wavelengths of light.
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:27.840]   I don't have anything against blue blockers.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:30.060]   In fact, many people find that blue blockers
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:34.040]   provide them some relief from headache and some eye strain
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.540]   if they wear blue blockers throughout the day
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.880]   and certainly at night, but you don't need them.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.040]   And even if you do wear them,
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.380]   you will find that if lights are very bright,
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:43.560]   doesn't matter if it's a blue light,
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.340]   a yellow light, or a red light,
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:48.660]   those bright lights will wake up your brain and body.
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:51.080]   They will activate the same mechanisms
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.480]   that were activated early in the day by sunlight.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:56.520]   However, and here's the really diabolical twist,
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.360]   I mentioned this earlier,
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.360]   but the diabolical twist in the way
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.260]   that your brain and body respond to light
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:03.920]   is that early in the day, in the morning hours,
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:06.080]   you need a lot of bright light, ideally from sunlight,
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.560]   to be very alert and to wake up.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.960]   But in the evening hours and nighttime hours,
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:14.560]   it takes very little light, very few photons,
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.060]   in order to wake up your brain and body
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:20.380]   and to disrupt your circadian clock and disrupt your sleep.
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:23.460]   So what that means is that once the sun goes down,
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:27.580]   which of course is going to happen at different times of year
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:28.900]   in different places on earth,
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:30.600]   but once the sun goes down,
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:32.960]   you would be wise to try and dim the lights
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.480]   in your indoor environment most days, right?
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.900]   I realize some nights you're going to throw a party
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.960]   and have people over, you might not want to dim the lights.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.320]   Some nights you're going to go out,
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.560]   you might view a lot of bright lights,
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.540]   but most nights of your life,
[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:45.120]   you're going to want to dim the lights
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.440]   in your internal environment.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:50.600]   And ideally the lights that you do use,
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.820]   you would place low in that physical environment.
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:55.020]   So you would try and not use overhead lights,
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:56.960]   but rather rely on desk lamps
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:00.020]   or lights even placed low to the floor, even on the floor.
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:04.940]   If you are going to use light at night, and most people do,
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.540]   I would encourage you to use as little artificial light
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:09.980]   as is required to carry out the activities
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:11.820]   you need to require safely.
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:12.660]   That could be studying,
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:14.420]   in which case you might need a little bit more light
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.040]   in order to read or study.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.140]   If you're watching a television show
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:19.920]   or you're watching something on your computer,
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.940]   dim that screen way, way down as dim as possible
[00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:24.500]   while still of course being able to view
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.560]   what you need to view.
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:27.260]   Even better, I should say,
[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:30.140]   ideally you would use candlelight and or moonlight.
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:31.880]   Now, some nights the moon is really bright
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.660]   and you actually can use moonlight
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:35.380]   to go about your usual activities.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.940]   Moonlight might seem very, very bright,
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:42.740]   but actually moonlight is fairly low light intensity
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:45.380]   and candlelight, which can also seem very bright,
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:47.840]   actually is very low light intensity.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.940]   If you're sitting across a table
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:51.460]   with some candlelight there,
[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:52.700]   it's a really bright candle,
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:55.940]   chances are it's only about three to 10 lux,
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.600]   which is very, very little light energy
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.780]   compared to say an artificial desk lamp
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.620]   or an overhead light,
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.140]   which is going to be in the area of anywhere
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.640]   from a hundred to a thousand lux.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.400]   So candlelight is fine,
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.920]   of course be cautious with open flame,
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.200]   but candlelight is fine, moonlight is fine,
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.300]   dimming artificial lights is fine
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.240]   provided they're dimmed way, way down.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.400]   And again, try and avoid using overhead artificial lights.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.560]   The absolute worst lights
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.280]   are going to be overhead fluorescent lights
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.060]   of the sort that you would have in the supermarket
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.480]   or that you would see at a gas station
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.700]   or something of that sort.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.580]   And I confess there are times in which I'm driving home
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.760]   and it's late at night and I want to be able to get to sleep
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.740]   and I'll need to stop at the grocery store
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.080]   or a gas station or something like that.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.920]   I've actually put on sunglasses at night
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.440]   in order to avoid getting that bright light exposure
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.780]   at night, although that's a little bit extreme.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.380]   I have done that from time to time
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:50.040]   because that bright light exposure
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.220]   will absolutely quash, it will eliminate any melatonin
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.360]   that happens to be circulating in your brain and body.
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.580]   Now melatonin, a lot of people think of as a supplement,
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.800]   but melatonin is naturally released
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.740]   as the evening comes about and into the nighttime hours,
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:05.780]   it's a hormone that makes you feel sleepy
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.440]   and allows you to fall asleep.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.280]   So viewing bright light in the late evening hours
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.760]   and nighttime hours is really not good
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.500]   for your sleep quality
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.000]   and your ability to fall and stay asleep.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.180]   So for most people, a simple rule of thumb
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:23.100]   is going to be avoid bright artificial lights of all colors
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.200]   and in particular overhead bright artificial lights
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.640]   between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.140]   That's right, between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:32.280]   avoid those bright artificial lights as much as possible,
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.540]   use only as much light as is absolutely necessary
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.440]   in order to carry out the routines
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.860]   and activities you need to carry out safely.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:40.960]   I should mention that the reason
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.920]   that overhead lights are problematic
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.360]   is the same reason why sunlight is so great early in the day
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.040]   which is that the cells, that is the neurons
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.500]   that can wake up your brain and body
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.420]   through activation of the circadian clock
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:55.500]   reside mainly in the bottom half
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.200]   or two thirds of your neural retina.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.220]   And the way the optics of your eyes work
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.520]   is that the cells on the bottom half of your eye
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.960]   view the upper visual field.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.860]   So this is a beautiful adaptive mechanism
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:08.480]   that allows these cells to respond to overhead light
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.080]   from sunlight in the early part of the day
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.160]   and throughout the day.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.960]   But in the evening, if you have bright artificial lights on
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.280]   and those bright artificial lights are overhead lights,
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.800]   it's going to more closely mimic
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.400]   what sunlight does in the evening time.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.720]   And that turns out to be a bad thing
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.640]   if your goal is to eventually go to sleep.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.400]   So again, do like the Scandinavians do,
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.100]   use lights that are set low in the room at night.
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:35.120]   And if you really want to optimize your sleep-wake cycles,
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.480]   I suppose you could also do the opposite throughout the day.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.800]   You could really emphasize the use
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.200]   of bright artificial lights and sunlight
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.040]   that comes from above.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.880]   And of course, sunlight always comes from above,
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:48.600]   but if you're working in a given office environment
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.220]   and it's 2 p.m. or 3 p.m.
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.100]   and you want to be as awake as possible,
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:53.540]   really crank up the overhead lights.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.800]   And then in the evening,
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.100]   which is this critical period three that we're referring to,
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:00.100]   really try and dim those lights or have them off
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:01.820]   or just rely on candlelight or moonlight
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:05.280]   from the hours of about 10 p.m. until 4 a.m.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.560]   Our good friend, Samir Hattar,
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.080]   who's been on this podcast before,
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.160]   Samir is director of the Chronobiology Unit
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.240]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.180]   Well, he's absolutely obsessive about this light stuff
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.120]   and avoiding light at night.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:20.480]   In fact, he lives in what I joke is like a cave at night
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.360]   from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m.,
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:25.380]   which is really his kind of sleep cycle.
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.980]   He has his house so dark that you'd be lucky
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.940]   to be able to find a spoon in the kitchen.
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.740]   In fact, you'd be lucky to find your way down the hallway
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.580]   if you're me.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:35.600]   But in any case, dim the lights from them way, way down.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.540]   It will serve you well.
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:40.120]   It will make it much easier for you to get sleepy
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.720]   and stay sleepy and fall asleep and stay asleep
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.560]   throughout the night.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.440]   Now, not to depart from this critical period three,
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:51.440]   but if you recall viewing that afternoon light, right?
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.140]   The low solar angle light as the sun is heading down
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:55.840]   in the sky, so it could be sunset
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:59.500]   or what I call circa sunset, around sunset.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.680]   Well, doing that is going to slightly
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.500]   but not completely offset any of the negative effects
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.800]   of viewing artificial light at night.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.480]   So I don't want to give people a pass here,
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.360]   but let's say you know that you're going to watch
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.900]   some Netflix at night or you're going to be up late studying
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.580]   and yet you still want to be able to fall and stay asleep.
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:20.080]   Definitely make sure you see that evening light.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.280]   There's a great study.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.520]   We'll provide a link to the study,
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.840]   which showed that if people view evening sunset light
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.480]   or evening sunsets or sunlight right around the time
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:33.760]   of sunset, it really serves to inoculate or offset some,
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.720]   again, some, not all of the negative effects
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.720]   of artificial light between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.400]   Now that's light, but as you recall,
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.180]   we also have this tool related to temperature.
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:46.120]   And you're probably not going to be surprised
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.680]   that the way to leverage temperature in the evening
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.140]   is the exact opposite of the way
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.380]   that you want to leverage temperature early in the day.
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.280]   Early in the day, temperature increases
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.240]   from cold showers or exercise, et cetera, wake you up.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.960]   What that means is that taking a cold shower late at night
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.900]   is probably a bad idea.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:06.680]   Rather, taking a nice hot bath or a sauna you might think
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.680]   would heat up your body.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.260]   And indeed that's what happens if you stay
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:12.680]   in a very long time, but if you do hot tub or a hot bath
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.580]   or a sauna in the evening and you don't stay in
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:16.620]   for more than 20 or 30 minutes and you get out,
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:20.340]   you take maybe a cool-ish shower or a warm shower,
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:23.380]   then what happens is there's a compensatory cooling off
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.620]   of your core body temperature
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.100]   for the reasons we discussed earlier,
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:29.100]   and your body temperature will drop by one to three degrees
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.520]   and it will make it much easier to get into sleep.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.140]   So if you're somebody that enjoys hot baths,
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.740]   hot showers, or hot tubs,
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.620]   evening and nighttime is going to be the best time
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:40.420]   to do that if your goal is to facilitate sleep.
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:43.220]   Similarly, you should try and make your sleeping environment
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:45.460]   pretty cool, if not cold.
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:46.820]   Now that doesn't mean you need to be cold
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:47.960]   while you're asleep.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.820]   You can get under as many blankets as you need,
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.740]   but it's a good idea to make your sleeping environment cool.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.000]   In fact, drop the temperature in that sleeping environment
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.740]   by at least three degrees and you'll be happy that you did.
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.820]   Now, some people rely on things like eight sleep
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.840]   that I use that one of these controllable
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:05.060]   temperature mattress covers.
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.500]   Other people would simply do this
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:09.260]   by putting a fan in the room or opening a window.
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.340]   Again, depends on time of year, depends on technology,
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.680]   depends on budgets, et cetera.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.980]   But you're going to want to sleep in a relatively cool
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.640]   or cold sleeping environment
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:20.900]   and then layer on the blankets as needed to stay asleep.
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.040]   And I say as needed because one of the things
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.600]   that you're going to do in your sleep,
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.440]   or if you happen to wake up is if you're too warm,
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.780]   you're going to put a foot or a hand out
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:32.240]   from under those blankets.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.460]   And the reason for doing that is very logical.
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:37.680]   Once you understand the mechanism, you have special portals.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:41.240]   You essentially have ways of passing heat, excuse me,
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.100]   in and out of your body,
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.880]   primarily through the palms of your hands,
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.240]   the upper half of your face and the bottoms of your feet
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.540]   through so-called glabrous skin.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.860]   This was covered in the episode with Dr. Craig Heller
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.860]   from the biology department at Stanford.
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:55.860]   If you lower the temperature in your sleeping environment,
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.520]   so lower the temperature in that room
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.480]   or use a controllable mattress cover that can cool down
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.300]   like eight sleep or something of that sort,
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:05.660]   it's naturally going to make your sleep environment cooler.
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:07.780]   And if you're too warm under the blankets,
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.940]   all you have to do is extend a hand or a foot out
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:11.020]   from under those blankets.
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.840]   Whereas if the sleeping environment that you're in
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:16.060]   is too warm, there's very little you can do to cool off
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.760]   besides push off those blankets.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.020]   So for instance, if you're too warm
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.340]   and you're waking up in the middle of the night,
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.140]   which is what happens if you get too warm,
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:23.260]   you'll push off those blankets.
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:25.540]   But if the room is too warm, well, what are you going to do?
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:27.760]   You'd probably have to put your hands into some cool water
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.820]   or take a coolish shower or something
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:30.960]   for a couple of seconds.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.360]   That's not very practical.
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.200]   Better to just keep the sleeping environment cool.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.800]   I'm not a big fan of people putting socks on
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.800]   while they sleep, or I should say,
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.840]   I'm not a fan of putting socks on while I sleep
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.340]   because that eliminates this glabrous skin portal
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:44.840]   on the bottoms of one's feet.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.120]   So for those of you that have heard,
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.220]   wear socks while you sleep,
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:50.280]   that works great for people that tend to run too cold
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.680]   while they sleep and wake up because their feet get cold.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.840]   But if you're somebody who wakes up
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.680]   in the middle of the night,
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.920]   this is how you're waking up because you're getting too warm.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.140]   And the best thing that you could do is to cool
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:01.920]   or lower the temperature in the room that you're sleeping
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.060]   and not wear socks.
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:05.700]   Get under as many blankets as you need to fall asleep.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:06.860]   And then across the night,
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.620]   you'll naturally just move a hand or a foot
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:10.760]   or all hands and feet out from under those blankets
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:13.300]   to cool off because of the relationship
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.400]   between temperature and sleep.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.600]   That is dropping your core body temperature
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.620]   one to three degrees gets you into sleep
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:19.940]   and helps you stay asleep.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:21.860]   So let's say you do exercise late in the day
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.740]   and you're finding yourself very alert in the evening
[01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:25.360]   and you need to fall asleep.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.700]   Or let's say you've exercised
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:29.300]   and you needed four cups of espresso
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.000]   in order to do that exercise.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.080]   Well, there are a few things that you can do
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.160]   to try and bring your nervous system down
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.820]   into more state of calmness.
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:36.880]   And you can do that also
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.180]   by lowering your core body temperature.
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:40.740]   One of those I already talked about before,
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:43.180]   taking a nice hot shower or a hot bath
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:44.480]   and then getting out and cooling off
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.300]   will decrease your body temperature.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.540]   Maybe not enough to get you into sleep
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:50.980]   if you have a ton of caffeine in your system.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.080]   But again, you can use this mechanism
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:56.140]   of temperature shifts to wake up
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:57.640]   or temperature shifts to fall asleep
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.720]   in ways that really can help you overcome
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.540]   some of the irregularities in your sleep-wake cycle
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.460]   and exercise cycle, et cetera.
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.320]   Because of course, nobody's perfect.
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.540]   Some days we end up having a workout in the afternoon
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.340]   or we'll miss the workout entirely.
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.240]   Other days we end up having that cup of coffee
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.160]   in the afternoon with a friend
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.960]   and then we have a hard time falling asleep.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.200]   So you can use these tools,
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.320]   not just in their optimized form,
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.440]   being absolutely obsessive and compulsive
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.620]   about exactly when you do each of those tools.
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:27.040]   That would be wonderful, but life happens as they say.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.340]   And some days you're going to feel too alert at night
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:30.420]   and you want to fall asleep,
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:33.440]   or you got to get up especially early the next morning
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:35.780]   and you're not somebody who normally goes to bed at 10 PM.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:37.920]   Well, that's when something like a hot bath or a sauna
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.760]   can really benefit you
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.080]   because it can adjust your temperature rhythm accordingly.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.040]   I would be remiss if I didn't touch on alcohol
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.100]   and CBD and THC.
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:48.000]   I always get questions about these.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.760]   And I should say, of course, many places, but not all,
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.360]   THC is illegal, although there are medical uses
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.960]   and some places it's decriminalized,
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.820]   other places it's legal.
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:01.960]   Alcohol of course is consumed almost as frequently
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.560]   as caffeine is consumed.
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.860]   I personally don't drink alcohol.
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:07.120]   I don't have anything against it per se.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.120]   I just don't tend to enjoy it.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.580]   One of the reasons I don't enjoy it is if I drink alcohol,
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:12.940]   I simply fall asleep.
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.100]   So that doesn't really accomplish any of the things
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.600]   that I really want to accomplish
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.120]   because the sleep that one gets after drinking alcohol
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.320]   is greatly disrupted sleep.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.800]   Hate to break it to you, but that's the truth.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.480]   And when Dr. Matt Walker came on this podcast,
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.080]   he said exactly the same thing.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:34.080]   While THC and alcohol do help some people fall asleep
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.360]   and maybe even stay asleep,
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.460]   the architecture of that sleep is suboptimal
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:40.680]   compared to the sleep they would get
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.100]   without alcohol or THC in their system.
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.600]   So I'm not here to tell you what to do or not to do.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:48.880]   I'm certainly not the substance police.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.020]   That's not my role.
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:51.560]   I'm just reporting to you the biology.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.660]   If your sleep is not restoring you
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:56.660]   to the extent that you feel it should,
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:59.920]   or if you are regularly relying on a drink or two
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:04.500]   in order to fall asleep or THC in order to fall asleep,
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.360]   that is disrupting your total pattern of sleep.
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.280]   However, I do realize that nowadays
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:12.980]   a lot of people are relying on THC and or CBD,
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:16.100]   especially edible forms in order to fall and stay asleep.
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.580]   And, you know, we can just acknowledge the data.
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:21.460]   It does seem that there's an anxiety-lowering effect
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:24.260]   of some of those compounds that do help people
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:26.580]   who have a hard time falling and staying asleep
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:28.860]   because of reasons related to anxiety.
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:29.700]   Although in a moment,
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:33.180]   we'll talk about some supplements and supplement protocols
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:36.140]   that can also assist in the ability to fall and stay asleep
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:37.640]   and that can adjust anxiety
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.260]   and that do not seem to disrupt sleep architecture
[01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.620]   in negative ways and in fact can enhance the depth
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:44.820]   and quality of sleep architecture.
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:47.580]   Okay, so you've done everything correctly up until now.
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:50.420]   You've got your morning routine from critical period one.
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.520]   You've got your afternoon routine.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.580]   You saw some sunlight in the afternoon.
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:55.320]   You avoided caffeine in the eight hours
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.080]   or 10 hours before bedtime.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.460]   You're not drinking alcohol.
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:00.420]   You've cooled down the room.
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:01.520]   You're doing all these things right.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.140]   You dim the lights, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:06.700]   What else can we do in order to optimize our sleep?
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:10.580]   Well, I always say behavioral tools first,
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:13.500]   then look to nutrition, then if necessary,
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.740]   look to supplementation, and then if still necessary,
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.820]   look to prescription drugs,
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:22.000]   obviously prescribed by a board certified physician.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.180]   Well, we've talked a lot about the behavioral tools
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:25.660]   for critical period three.
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:26.900]   We have not talked a lot
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.900]   about the supplementation based tools.
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:30.980]   There are supplements that for most people
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:35.080]   will greatly improve their ability to fall and stay asleep.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.420]   And the three main supplements in that category
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.780]   or that kit of sleep supplements,
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.060]   and I've talked about these before,
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:47.060]   are magnesium threonate, so T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:51.940]   apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin,
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:55.380]   and theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine.
[01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:58.340]   Now, some important things to point out about magthreonate
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.300]   as it's called apigenin and theanine.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:03.500]   First of all, you don't necessarily need to take all three,
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.920]   although many people get a synergistic effect
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.180]   from taking all three.
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:10.240]   In fact, you may not even need to take even one.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:13.040]   What I recommend is that if you're already doing
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.660]   all the behavioral tools regularly
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:17.900]   and you're still having trouble falling asleep
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:21.380]   and staying asleep, well, then you might try
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:24.140]   one of the supplements within this sleep stack.
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.200]   They do have fairly wide margins for safety,
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.740]   although I should also say anytime you're going to add
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.860]   or remove something from your supplement protocol,
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:33.100]   your nutritional program,
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.600]   you definitely want to talk to your physician.
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.760]   I don't just say that to protect us,
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.140]   I say that to protect you.
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.300]   But for most people, the margins of safety on these things
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:40.600]   are going to be pretty broad.
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:42.980]   A couple of notes about dosages.
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:45.540]   For some people, the dosages of any one or several
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:47.820]   of the supplements I mentioned will be zero.
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:50.000]   That is, you won't need them in order to get
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.220]   and stay asleep most nights of your life.
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:55.260]   That's terrific if you don't need them.
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:58.900]   For many people, however, taking 145 milligrams
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:02.500]   of magnesium threonate can be very beneficial.
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:06.260]   That's the dosage that most people will benefit from.
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:07.540]   Some people need to go a little higher.
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.500]   Some people need to go a little bit lower.
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.140]   One of the reasons that we've been pointing people
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:14.740]   towards single ingredient formulations these days
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:17.380]   is because it allows people to adjust the dosage
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:19.780]   of one component of a so-called sleep stack
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:23.620]   without having to disrupt the dosage of another component
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:24.460]   and so on.
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.580]   It also allows people to try just one element
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:29.900]   within the sleep stack without having to purchase
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.660]   and try the others, which is a problem
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:33.940]   if you're buying a blend of a lot of different ingredients.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:36.980]   So 145 milligrams of magnesium threonate,
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:39.880]   50, five zero milligrams of apigenin,
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:42.540]   and again, you could just take the apigenin on its own,
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:47.540]   and 100 to 400 milligrams of theanine taken, again, alone
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:50.780]   or in combination with the other supplements mentioned
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:53.220]   in this stack, many people find allows them
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:56.620]   to get really drowsy and fall asleep, sleep really deeply,
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:58.780]   and they feel much more refreshed the next day
[01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:01.100]   and they don't have a grogginess to them.
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:04.620]   Now, a couple of notes about these different supplements.
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:09.220]   About 5% of people report that magnesium threonate
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.380]   really disrupts their gut.
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:12.620]   It gives them diarrhea or gastric distress,
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:14.420]   in which case, don't take it.
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:19.420]   If magnesium threonate disrupts your gut or your digestion
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:21.180]   to a point where it's uncomfortable or at all
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:23.060]   and you don't like it, don't take any of it.
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.400]   The proper dosage for you, in other words,
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.140]   would be zero milligrams.
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:28.240]   Now, in a slightly different way,
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:31.260]   many people who can tolerate magnesium threonate
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.760]   or really thrive on magnesium threonate,
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:37.040]   and like apigenin, might find that theanine,
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.160]   even at the lowest dose of 100 milligrams,
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.180]   'cause again, the range is 100 to 400 milligrams,
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:44.060]   that theanine gives them such vivid dreams
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:46.360]   that they actually find it disruptive,
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:47.900]   or they wake up in the middle of the night,
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:49.800]   or they find that the sleep that they're getting
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.340]   is kind of anxiety-ridden
[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:53.120]   because of the intensity of those dreams.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.200]   So some people might choose to leave theanine
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.960]   out of the sleep stack and just take magnesium threonate
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.040]   or apigenin, and again, some people might leave magnesium
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.680]   threonate out of the sleep stack.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.760]   Again, all of this is really about
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.020]   finding the supplementation protocol that's ideal for you.
[01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:10.060]   I should mention that whether or not you're taking one
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:13.620]   or two or three of the components of the sleep stack,
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:16.060]   the ideal time to take those is 30 to 60 minutes
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.500]   before bedtime, especially if you haven't had anything
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.060]   to eat for the three hours or so before bedtime.
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:23.000]   I confess that oftentimes I'll have a little bit
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.540]   of a snack late in the evening, some berries or something.
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.420]   I try not to eat too close to bedtime,
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:29.300]   but some evenings just because of work schedule,
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:32.340]   I'll get home late, be 9 p.m., and I'll eat a big meal,
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:34.400]   and then I'll take the sleep stack and fall asleep.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.400]   Every once in a while, that just so happens.
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.280]   Nobody's perfect. Certainly I'm not.
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.880]   But that sleep stack can be very beneficial,
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:44.660]   and I do think that it's preferable to melatonin.
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:45.500]   Here's the reason.
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.260]   First of all, melatonin is a hormone
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:48.600]   that you endogenously make.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.240]   You now know a lot about melatonin,
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.040]   and it's controlled by light,
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.760]   meaning light inhibits it or eliminates it.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.020]   Darkness promotes it.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:01.100]   And melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep,
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:03.280]   but the dosages of melatonin that are contained
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:07.020]   in most commercial products is far, far, far greater
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:08.260]   than what we would make endogenously.
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:10.880]   So it's really supra physiological.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.940]   So that's of concern because melatonin
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:15.900]   is not just responsible for making us sleepy
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:16.880]   and fall asleep.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.500]   It also does things like interacts
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:22.100]   with other hormone systems, testosterone and estrogen,
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:23.960]   even in the puberty system in kids.
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.700]   Is taking melatonin every once in a while a problem
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:29.660]   for adjusting to jet lag, et cetera?
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:30.680]   Probably not.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.840]   Why are we even saying no?
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.920]   But taking it chronically over time,
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.480]   especially kids taking it chronically over time
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.000]   can potentially be problematic.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.460]   So at least in my opinion,
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.300]   these other supplements are going to be preferable
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.680]   to melatonin.
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.720]   Now, as I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.080]   there are some other things
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.220]   that I certainly take every once in a while
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:51.100]   and that other people might consider taking
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.880]   in addition to the sleep stack I talked about before,
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:55.740]   or in place of that sleep stack,
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:57.580]   if that sleep stack doesn't work well for them.
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:59.020]   So every third or fourth night,
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:01.720]   I will take two grams of glycine
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.700]   and a hundred milligrams of GABA
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:06.520]   in addition to the standard sleep stack
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.500]   that I talked about before.
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.680]   So I'm taking magthreonine, apigen and theanine,
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.240]   and then I will also take two grams of glycine and GABA,
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.080]   which I find greatly enhances my ability to get into sleep.
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:19.400]   But the reason I only add glycine and GABA
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.000]   every third or fourth night
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.520]   is that if I take it too often,
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.080]   I find that the entire sleep stack
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.580]   doesn't work quite as effectively.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.220]   I don't know exactly why this is the case,
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:29.900]   but in any event, that's what I do.
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:33.600]   And more recently, I've also started using inositol,
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.760]   in particular, myoinositol every other night.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.320]   I'll take 900 milligrams of myoinositol
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:42.600]   in addition to magthreonine, apigenine and theanine,
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.640]   and not on the nights when I take glycine and GABA.
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:48.560]   So I'm adding 900 milligrams of inositol
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.480]   to the standard sleep stack
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.920]   of magthreonine and apigenine.
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.320]   And what I find is not only does it greatly enhance
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.120]   my ability to fall asleep quickly,
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.800]   but if I wake up in the middle of the night,
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.560]   which I often do to use the bathroom,
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:05.480]   I find it very, very easy to fall back asleep.
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:10.280]   Whereas when I don't take inositol every other night or so,
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.760]   I find that if I wake up in the middle of the night,
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:14.380]   it's a bit more of a challenge to fall back asleep.
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:16.960]   So inositol has a number of different uses
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.560]   that have been discussed in terms of mental health
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:22.740]   and in terms of adjusting anxiety for its daytime use.
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:24.520]   What I'm talking about is taking 900 milligrams
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.160]   of myoinositol also 30 to 60 minutes before sleep,
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.440]   along with the standard sleep stack.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.680]   And I found that to be immensely beneficial.
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.160]   I also noticed that it has a pretty long tail
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:37.240]   of anxiety suppression throughout the day.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.640]   And I'm not somebody who suffers from anxiety,
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:42.800]   but I have to say it just has led me to feel a bit calmer
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:43.640]   throughout the day.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.720]   And I don't really know how to say this except
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:48.560]   in subjective terms to feel a bit more buffered against
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.440]   or resilience against stress events.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.600]   And if you look at the literature on inositol
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.680]   and its interactions with the serotonin system
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:56.180]   and other systems,
[01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:58.320]   that all makes sense as to why that would be the case.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.400]   So we will provide links to our so-called sleep kit,
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.240]   which is part of our neural network newsletter.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.000]   It's a zero cost newsletter where you can access
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.820]   this information about supplements
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:08.620]   and other behavioral tools for sleep in list form.
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:10.560]   But that sleep kit doesn't include some
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.700]   of the newer information that I've provided this episode,
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:15.200]   in particular, the information about inositol
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.240]   and what I'm finding to be the very beneficial use
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:22.240]   of inositol for the ability to fall back asleep
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:23.560]   after waking up in the middle of the night,
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.660]   which is something that a lot of people struggle with.
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:28.340]   Now that's supplementation for falling and staying asleep,
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:31.520]   but we can return to the behavioral tools
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:35.320]   also as powerful levers and tools for falling asleep
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.520]   and getting back to sleep.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:40.320]   And again, we look to NSDR, non-sleep deep rest
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.860]   or the Reverie app as a way to do that.
[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:46.260]   As I mentioned earlier, the Reverie app has been developed
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:49.260]   on the basis of really high quality peer reviewed research,
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:52.140]   both clinical and nonclinical by my colleague,
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:53.700]   David Spiegel, who's our associate chair
[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:55.140]   of psychiatry at Stanford.
[01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:56.580]   It's a wonderful tool.
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:00.380]   It does carry a cost after the initial seven day trial.
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.920]   I can tell you what the cost on that is
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:06.180]   so you can get a sense because I do realize
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:07.580]   that anything that carries a cost,
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:09.420]   for some people it won't be accessible.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.900]   Right now, Reverie, and I should just mention,
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.140]   they didn't pay us for an ad read.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.660]   I'm just telling you what they told me
[01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:19.380]   so that I can accurately report what cost to use Reverie.
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:21.040]   They have a monthly subscription
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.220]   to use the Reverie app at 14.99.
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:25.040]   You do get the seven day free trial.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:28.140]   They have a yearly subscription of 99.99
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:29.260]   with a seven day free trial,
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.680]   and they have a lifetime purchase,
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.540]   one-time purchase of 2.49 with no trial.
[01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:36.120]   Right now is only available for Apple, not for Android,
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:39.060]   but they are, yes, going to have it available for Android.
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:41.340]   Soon, there's a signup list there.
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:45.360]   I should mention that while the cost might seem high,
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.940]   if you compare that cost to, say, supplements,
[01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:50.700]   or you compare that cost to a poor night's sleep over time,
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:54.380]   the cost, at least to me, seems somewhat modest,
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:56.340]   certainly within range for a number of people,
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.020]   but I acknowledge not within range for other people,
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:02.900]   which is why I also want to point to zero cost tools,
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:05.260]   and the zero cost tool for getting asleep,
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:09.700]   staying asleep, and falling back asleep is going to be NSDR,
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.560]   we'll put a link to a non-sleep deep rest protocol
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:12.580]   that's available on YouTube,
[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:14.400]   so available to anybody, zero cost,
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.840]   provided you have a internet connection.
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:17.780]   Again, dim the screen
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:19.580]   if you're going to turn that on late at night.
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:22.660]   And there are a number of other Yoganidra scripts
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:25.620]   and apps and sources around the internet,
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:26.500]   in particular on YouTube,
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.380]   that are zero cost that you could use
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:30.660]   if the Reverie app is outside your price range
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:34.060]   or is not preferable to you, et cetera.
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:35.440]   When I wake up in the middle of the night,
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:36.580]   it's usually to use the restroom.
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:37.400]   I'll go use the restroom.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.900]   We'll keep the lights as dim as possible.
[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:40.260]   I'll get back into bed,
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:42.940]   and if I find that it's easy to fall asleep, great,
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:44.460]   I'm asleep, and if not,
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.540]   then I will generally plug in the Reverie app.
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.900]   They have a fall back asleep hypnosis,
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:53.140]   and 99 times out of 100, I'm back asleep within minutes,
[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:54.660]   and I don't wake up until morning.
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:57.100]   Now, very briefly, I just want to touch on some tools
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.220]   that are very commonly used by many people out there,
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:00.060]   and believe it or not,
[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:03.020]   there is peer-reviewed science on things like eye masks.
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:05.940]   Do eye masks improve your ability to stay asleep?
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:09.180]   And indeed, they do, provided they are not too tight,
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.860]   and provided that the room is cool enough.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:12.700]   Why?
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:14.540]   Well, eye masks cover the upper half of your face,
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:17.620]   which is where glabrous skin is localized.
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:19.300]   Remember, palms of the hands, bottoms of the feet,
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:21.020]   glabrous skin on the face.
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:23.700]   So a lot of people who wear eye masks will wake up
[01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:25.620]   because they're too warm if the room is too warm.
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:28.640]   So if you're going to use an eye mask to keep light out,
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:31.140]   definitely make sure the room and your sleeping environment
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.700]   and your bed are cool enough
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:34.340]   in order for you to stay asleep.
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:36.780]   In addition, I get a lot of questions about earplugs.
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:38.060]   Here's the deal with earplugs.
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.000]   Some people find that earplugs are very beneficial
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.780]   because, of course, they prevent the entrance of sound
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:45.720]   into the ear that could wake us up,
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:48.460]   but some people find that the sound of their own beating
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:50.800]   of their own heart can be disruptive,
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.780]   and they get a sort of humming in their head
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:54.540]   when they have those earplugs in.
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:56.740]   I'm one such person, although I have family members
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.460]   that like using earplugs when they sleep.
[01:23:58.460 --> 01:23:59.660]   So it's really up to you.
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.900]   You have to see whether or not those earplugs
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:03.660]   help or disrupt your sleep.
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:05.240]   For me, they're no good.
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.940]   For some people, they really enjoy them.
[01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:09.020]   I don't use an eye mask unless I'm sleeping
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:10.180]   in a really bright environment
[01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:13.660]   or I need to sleep on a plane and things of that sort.
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:15.260]   Other tools that I'll just mention
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:17.640]   that have peer-reviewed research to support them,
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.500]   elevating your feet either with a pillow
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:21.600]   or by elevating the end of your bed
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:25.060]   by about three to five degrees can be really beneficial
[01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.380]   for increasing the depth of sleep
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:28.460]   because of the so-called glymphatic washout.
[01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:30.780]   This is the movement and circulation of fluids
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:34.540]   in your brain at night that lead to more wakefulness
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.500]   and actually can improve cognitive function
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:39.260]   and a number of other things related to brain health.
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:40.720]   There's one caveat to that.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:43.040]   For people that suffer from acid reflux,
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.980]   having your ankles elevated above your chest
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.600]   or above your heart in the middle of the night
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.900]   can actually exacerbate that acid reflux.
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:51.040]   You want to do the opposite.
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:54.080]   You want to actually elevate the head side of your bed
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.560]   by about three to five degrees.
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.100]   Now, one of the common causes of sleep disruption
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:00.900]   that has tremendously detrimental effects
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.500]   is so-called sleep apnea.
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:05.180]   So this is basically bouts of suffocation
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:07.340]   or lack of oxygenation during sleep.
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:08.900]   This is particularly the case
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:10.500]   for people that are very heavyset,
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.060]   and that heavyset could be from obesity.
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:14.540]   It could also be heavyset from having too much muscle.
[01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:16.980]   A lot of people who are carrying too much muscle
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:19.100]   will actually have sleep apnea without realizing it.
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:21.260]   Sleep apnea is actually very dangerous.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:23.940]   It's associated with a number of cardiovascular issues.
[01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:25.420]   It's associated with sexual dysfunction.
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.780]   It's associated with issues with cognition.
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:28.740]   Sleep apnea is bad.
[01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:30.780]   A lot of people will have to use the PAP,
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.620]   which is a device.
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:36.220]   It looks like a sort of like a snorkel mask or dive mask.
[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:40.140]   It's a whole apparatus that people go to sleep with.
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:43.620]   However, many people can relieve themselves of sleep apnea
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:46.500]   provided it's not too serious and can sleep much better.
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.340]   In fact, I think all people can sleep much better
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:50.780]   if they train themselves to be nose breathers
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:52.260]   while they sleep.
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:53.880]   There are a lot of reasons to be a nose breather
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:56.940]   unless you are breathing very hard due to exercise
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:58.760]   or talking or eating.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:01.700]   That was all covered in James Nestor's book, "Breath,"
[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:02.900]   the new science of a lost art.
[01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:04.820]   It's been covered in a number of different podcasts.
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:07.500]   We've talked about it on this podcast as well.
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:08.900]   It's a good idea to be a nose breather
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:10.460]   unless you need to mouth breathe.
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:11.940]   And it's a great idea.
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:15.960]   It's a superb idea to be a nose breather in sleep.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:17.720]   And one way to really get good at that
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.060]   is to take a little bit of medical tape
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:21.380]   and to tape your mouth shut before going to sleep.
[01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:23.820]   You heard me right, put some medical tape over your mouth
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:26.060]   and force yourself to nose breathe during sleep.
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:28.820]   It also prevents snoring in most cases,
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:31.660]   really offset sleep apnea.
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:34.860]   Sleep apnea, again, being a very serious health concern.
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:36.780]   I should also mention as a tool
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:39.920]   that if you have a hard time being a nose breather in sleep,
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:42.480]   you can try doing your cardiovascular exercise,
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:45.260]   at least the lower intensity cardiovascular exercise
[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:47.580]   through purely nasal breathing.
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:49.940]   And one way to do that, again, is to tape your mouth shut
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:51.180]   or put a gulp of water in your mouth,
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:54.340]   but don't actually swallow that mouthful of water
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:57.420]   or to use a mouthpiece or just deliberately
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.260]   keep your mouth closed
[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:00.000]   and insist on breathing through your nose.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:00.840]   Most people find that
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.940]   when they start doing cardiovascular exercise that way,
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:04.940]   it's really challenging at first,
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:07.420]   but over time they actually can feel quite calm
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:09.980]   and still can generate a lot of physical effort
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:12.220]   purely using nose breathing.
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:13.820]   The reason that doing nose breathing
[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.280]   during cardiovascular exercise
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.620]   translates to being a nose breather during sleep
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:21.020]   is that your sinuses actually can dilate their plastic
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:25.220]   and over time, plastic meaning they're malleable, that is,
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:26.660]   and they can become wider.
[01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:28.500]   You're not going to get giant nostrils, don't worry about it.
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:31.380]   Your airways within your skull,
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:33.060]   'cause that's what the sinuses really are,
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:34.860]   these little passages within the skull
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:37.860]   and of course within the nasal passages will dilate
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:40.260]   and will allow you to breathe more easily through your nose.
[01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:41.380]   But for those of you
[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:42.940]   that are waking up in the middle of the night,
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:46.180]   breathing on your back or your partner is telling you that
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:47.560]   or other people are telling you that,
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.700]   or that person on the plane with your mouth hanging open
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.900]   and drooling and your mouth breathing,
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:53.980]   terrible, terrible, terrible for health reasons
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:54.820]   and other reasons.
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:56.500]   Put some medical tape over your mouth,
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.300]   learn to be a nose breather during sleep,
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.540]   your sleep will improve
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:02.420]   and your daytime feelings of wakefulness and focus
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:05.140]   will improve, your cardiovascular health will improve
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:06.200]   and on and on and on.
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.900]   So now we've largely covered the tools
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:10.740]   that one could use to get and stay asleep.
[01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:12.740]   And we talked about exercise, we talked about temperature,
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:14.580]   we talked about supplements,
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:15.500]   and we talked about, of course,
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.940]   keeping the sleeping environment both cool
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:20.820]   and as dark as possible.
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:24.340]   I do want to mention a couple of broad contour tools
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:27.460]   that will impact your ability to sleep really well
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:28.600]   on a consistent basis.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.780]   And the one that impacts the most number of people
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:33.020]   is weekends.
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:35.620]   Turns out that most everybody feels the impulse
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:36.900]   to sleep in on the weekend,
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:38.980]   especially if they've been out late the night before.
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:40.740]   However, the data show
[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:44.260]   that keeping relatively consistent sleep and wake times
[01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:46.360]   is really going to enhance the quality
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.860]   and depth of your sleep.
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:49.980]   So if you stay out late one night,
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:52.660]   sure, you might allow yourself to sleep in an extra hour
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:56.800]   or so, but you should really try to avoid sleeping in longer
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:00.260]   than an hour beyond your normal wake-up time.
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:01.100]   That's right.
[01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:02.620]   If you normally get eight hours of sleep
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:04.780]   and you wake up at 7 a.m.,
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:08.220]   probably okay to wake up at 8 a.m. on the weekend
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:10.820]   or after a night out the night before,
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:13.140]   but try not to sleep until 11 or noon
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:15.060]   thinking that you're going to catch up on your sleep
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:17.420]   or that's better than waking up at a consistent time.
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:19.460]   It would be better to wake up at a consistent time
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:22.060]   plus or minus an hour and get a nap in the afternoon
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:25.140]   provided that nap, again, isn't too long.
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:27.640]   And the other tool that relates to nights
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.860]   that you stayed out too late
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:31.760]   or that you feel like you want to sleep in a bit more
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:35.220]   in the morning is if you are going to wake up
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:36.140]   at your consistent time.
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:39.200]   So for example, normally you go to bed at 10
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:40.240]   and you wake up at six.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.140]   Let's say that's your schedule
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:44.900]   and you end up staying up late one night until midnight
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:47.220]   or one for whatever reason.
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:49.300]   And the next morning you wake up at seven
[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:50.640]   and you're still groggy.
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.160]   In that case, you absolutely want to wait
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:57.500]   to ingest caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.780]   You really do because there are good data
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:02.940]   to support the fact that caffeine can disrupt sleep.
[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:05.020]   Yes, that's obvious.
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:06.980]   Caffeine especially disrupts sleep
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:08.920]   if you take it too late in the day.
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.500]   That's very obvious as to why that would be the case.
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:14.460]   But caffeine especially disrupts
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:16.640]   what's called compensatory sleep.
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:19.560]   So if you start changing your waking time
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.600]   and your to sleep time
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:23.180]   and you start using additional caffeine
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:25.320]   to offset the sleepiness that you're experiencing
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:26.840]   because of those late nights out,
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:28.920]   well, that's when you really start to disrupt
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.360]   not just your nighttime sleep
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:31.920]   but your daytime compensatory sleep.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.220]   So those naps, you also are disrupting
[01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:37.420]   the total architecture of sleep in the early morning hours.
[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:40.200]   There's a lot of great science that's been put to this
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:42.200]   or that's emerged from this, I should say.
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:45.400]   So try and keep those sleep wake times relatively constant
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:46.460]   plus or minus an hour.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:50.440]   And try as much as you can to delay that caffeine intake
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.980]   90 to 120 minutes after waking every day
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:55.260]   but especially on days where you wake up
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:56.620]   and you feel you haven't gotten enough sleep.
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:59.380]   In that case, I highly recommend you just use NSDR
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:03.520]   or the Reverie app or some other form of deep relaxation
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:05.720]   to try and compensate for the lack of sleep.
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:10.580]   Knowing, of course, that there's no complete compensation
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:11.420]   for lack of sleep.
[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:12.620]   There are just things that we can do
[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:14.820]   to partially offset lack of sleep.
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:17.280]   Now, a couple of final points and additional tools
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:19.780]   that I think are going to be useful to everybody.
[01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:22.720]   In particular, people who have young children
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:25.460]   or following a shift work schedule
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:28.580]   or who are experiencing jet lag.
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:31.920]   Keep in mind, jet lag can be due to travel, which is obvious
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:34.700]   but jet lag can also be due to getting woken up
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:35.660]   in the middle of the night, right?
[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:36.700]   Your body doesn't know the difference
[01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:38.860]   between flying to a new time zone
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:41.000]   and getting woken up in the middle of the night.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.360]   The tool that I'd like to offer you is an understanding
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.220]   of something called temperature minimum.
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:46.960]   And I'm going to make this as simple as possible
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:49.080]   and I'm confident that everyone can understand this
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.980]   even if you don't have any science background.
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:54.440]   Here's the question you need to ask yourself.
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:57.940]   What is your typical wake-up time?
[01:31:57.940 --> 01:31:59.300]   Okay, what's your typical wake-up time?
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:01.940]   If for you, your typical wake-up time is 7 a.m.,
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:03.440]   plus or minus half an hour.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:06.440]   So, and that could be 7 a.m. because you set an alarm clock
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.580]   or it could be 7 a.m. because you naturally wake up
[01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:10.040]   at 7 a.m., doesn't matter.
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:13.720]   If your typical wake-up time most days is 7 a.m.,
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:16.600]   well then your temperature minimum is 5 a.m.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.960]   That's right, your temperature minimum is not a temperature,
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:21.880]   it's a time within your 24-hour cycle.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:26.140]   Approximately two hours before your typical wake-up time,
[01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.560]   your body is at its lowest temperature
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:31.060]   that it will ever be in the 24-hour cycle.
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:33.440]   That's why it's called your temperature minimum.
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.660]   Here's what you need to know about your temperature minimum.
[01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:40.640]   If you view bright light, exercise, or drink caffeine,
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:44.560]   or all of the above in the two to four hours
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:47.400]   before your temperature minimum,
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.540]   that will delay your clock.
[01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:51.380]   What that means when I say delay your clock
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:54.120]   is it will make you want to go to sleep later
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:56.600]   and wake up later the next night.
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.780]   Okay, so let's run this exercise for you,
[01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:02.020]   the person waking up at 7 a.m. on a regular basis.
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:04.460]   I can predict with almost certainty
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:05.760]   that your body is going to be
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:08.720]   at its lowest temperature at 5 a.m.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:12.640]   So what that means is that if you get up at 3 a.m.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:16.640]   or at 4 a.m. and you flip on bright lights in your house
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:18.980]   or in your bathroom, or you have a cup of coffee,
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:20.300]   or you do any kind of exercise,
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.740]   or you get up and head to the airport,
[01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:25.240]   the mechanisms in your brain and body
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:27.640]   that control timing of sleep and timing of waking
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:29.360]   will shift, they will delay.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:32.500]   It's as if you put your clock on hold for a little while
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.160]   and then let it start again.
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:35.720]   Yeah, that's the simplest way I can describe it.
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:38.680]   And you will tend to want to go to sleep later
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:41.520]   and wake up later the following night.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:46.040]   Now, the opposite is true if you view bright light,
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:50.040]   drink caffeine, or exercise, or socialize, I should say,
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:53.740]   in the hours immediately after your temperature minimum.
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:55.640]   So for you in this example,
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:57.440]   the person who's waking up at 7 a.m.,
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:59.280]   your temperature minimum is 5 a.m.,
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:01.120]   if you view bright light, exercise,
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.800]   maybe have a snack, maybe not,
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:07.800]   or socialize, move about at 5.30 or 6 a.m. or 7 a.m.,
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:12.320]   that will tend to phase advance your clock.
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:15.960]   It will tend to basically make you want to go to bed earlier
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:18.160]   and wake up earlier the following night.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.600]   Now, I use this example of a person
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.400]   who wakes up typically at 7 a.m.,
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:22.960]   whose temperature minimum is 5 a.m.,
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:25.720]   but of course you need to adjust that for yourself
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.160]   if you're somebody who wakes up at 9 a.m.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.720]   or at 5 a.m., et cetera.
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:30.060]   Why do I offer this as a tool?
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:32.560]   Well, this is an immensely powerful tool
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:34.760]   if, for instance, you're headed to a time zone
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:36.040]   where you need to go to bed earlier
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:38.720]   and wake up earlier once you arrive in that time zone.
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:41.520]   What it means is in the day or two before you leave,
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:46.520]   you can force yourself to exercise, drink caffeine,
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.000]   maybe even to eat a meal early in the morning,
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.600]   or maybe you still fast early in the morning,
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:51.760]   and that's really up to you,
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:54.520]   but you force yourself to do the activities
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.380]   that are going to phase advance your clock.
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:34:59.280]   Whereas if you're traveling to a time zone
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:02.040]   where you are going to need to go to sleep much later
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.040]   and you're going to need to wake up much later,
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:06.320]   or even a little bit later,
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.440]   you can do those things in the hours
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.740]   prior to your temperature minimum.
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:12.520]   Now, for those of you that work shift work,
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:14.340]   this can be especially useful,
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:17.540]   but I want to say a couple of things about shift work.
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:19.640]   There are a lot of details about shift work and jet lag
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.360]   in an episode that I did specifically
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:22.840]   about jet lag and shift work.
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.160]   So for the deep dive, go there,
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.520]   but suffice to say this for now.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:29.160]   If you are going to do shift work,
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:32.040]   try to stay on the same shift for two weeks at a time.
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:34.340]   It's very detrimental to brain and body.
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:37.740]   It can even be horrifically challenging
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.500]   for your brain and body in a number of ways.
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:42.400]   If you are switching on the so-called swing shift,
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:43.880]   you know, you're working three days, the night shift,
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.720]   three days, the day shift,
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.000]   three days, the night shift, three days,
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.020]   try and stay on the same schedule as much as possible.
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:50.920]   And I should say for everybody,
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:54.840]   people who are jet lagged and engaged in shift work or not,
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:55.880]   but just for everybody,
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:59.720]   if you need to be awake in the middle of your sleep cycle,
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:02.380]   and it's not just a quick departure to the bathroom
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:04.560]   and back to bed, but you really need to be awake.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.760]   You know, you're feeding a baby
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.160]   or you're taking care of a loved one,
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.580]   or you need to do something that's critical,
[01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:12.800]   or you need to work, if possible, use red light.
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.400]   Okay, now for shift workers who really are trying
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:17.480]   to stay awake all night and sleep all day,
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:18.840]   this is not going to be ideal.
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:20.560]   But for people that, for instance,
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:22.020]   need to stay up really late one night
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:23.320]   or wake up especially early,
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:25.080]   like 3 a.m. to prepare for an exam
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:26.520]   that you're just not ready for,
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:29.360]   or to head to the airport, et cetera,
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.080]   using red light has been shown to allow people
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.760]   to be awake enough and obviously see what they need to see
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:37.080]   in order to perform their activity safely.
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:40.680]   But it does not seem to disrupt the cortisol rhythm
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:43.320]   that is the healthy, normal cortisol rhythm.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.360]   I realize this is kind of an advanced tool
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:46.920]   and many people won't have access to this.
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:50.040]   There are a number of different sources for red lights now.
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:53.020]   Companies like Juve or Cozy Light,
[01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:54.100]   these are different brands.
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:55.920]   I don't have any affiliation to any of these brands,
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:56.760]   I should say.
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:00.100]   There are a number of different red light bulb sources
[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:01.240]   out there and commercial sources
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:02.700]   that you can explore if you want.
[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:04.720]   But understanding this temperature minimum
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:07.020]   is really powerful because it allows you
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:08.800]   to adjust your schedule depending on travel,
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:11.540]   depending on changing work schedules or school schedules.
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:12.860]   And if you're not a morning person,
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:15.620]   you can use the tools related to temperature minimum
[01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:18.580]   to really become a morning person over time.
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:20.100]   And it actually is pretty easy.
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:22.360]   And I talked about this in a previous episode,
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:24.300]   I'll just mention that there have been shown
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:27.220]   to be important positive effects on cognition,
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:29.680]   on even grip strength and physical performance
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:32.900]   for people that are early morning risers.
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:35.440]   And that's especially true for night owls
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:38.680]   that deliberately shift themselves to become early risers.
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.140]   Okay, so that's a lot of information and a lot of tools.
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:42.620]   And I suppose the one set of tools
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:45.260]   that I really didn't drill into too deeply,
[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:47.080]   the ones related to jet lag and shift work.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:49.220]   And again, please check out the episode
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:52.160]   on jet lag and shift work if that's relevant to you.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:55.940]   But I think for most people who are going to sleep at night
[01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:58.500]   and are trying their best to sleep well at night
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.660]   and are trying their best to wake up in the morning
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:02.780]   at whatever hour and stay alert and focused
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:04.840]   throughout the day, maybe with a brief nap.
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:06.500]   The tools that I talked about today related
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:10.420]   to light temperature, food, exercise, caffeine, supplements,
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:13.380]   and digital tools, I'm hoping will prove
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:15.420]   to be very useful for you.
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:17.220]   They certainly are all supported
[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:19.500]   by excellent peer-reviewed research.
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.060]   And I should just emphasize again
[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:22.580]   that most of the tools we talked about
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:24.520]   are completely zero cost.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.940]   So while the supplements and some of the digital tools
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:29.060]   do carry some cost to them,
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:30.400]   I really want to encourage everybody
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:32.240]   to get your behaviors right.
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:35.280]   Get all of the things related to your timing of exercise
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:39.320]   and type of exercise in the best possible order
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:40.160]   and time of day.
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.440]   We talked about this critical period early in the day
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.460]   and then another critical period in the middle of the day
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:45.380]   and the late afternoon.
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:46.620]   And then this third critical period
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:47.540]   in the middle of the night.
[01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:50.680]   Different tools for the different three critical periods.
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:53.220]   I promise that if you start to implement some
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:55.460]   or ideally all of these tools,
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:58.380]   the quality of your sleep will increase tremendously.
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:00.400]   And of course, in doing so,
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:02.140]   the quality of your daytime alertness
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:04.580]   and your ability to focus will improve tremendously.
[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:08.460]   Again, sleep is the absolute foundation
[01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:10.340]   of your mental health, your physical health,
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:12.280]   and your performance in all endeavors.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.380]   So if there's one area of your life to really focus on
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:17.700]   and try and optimize,
[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:20.100]   if your goal is to be happier and more productive
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:22.940]   and just to have a better life overall,
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:25.520]   I can confidently say that sleep
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.500]   is really the thing to optimize.

[01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:59.500]   We do read all those comments.
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.460]   In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:02.880]   at the beginning of today's podcast.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.540]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:07.780]   During today's podcast and on many previous episodes
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:10.060]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we talked about supplements.
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:12.200]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.120]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:15.780]   for things like sleep and focus
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:17.480]   and hormone support and so forth.
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:19.380]   For reasons mentioned at the beginning of the episode,
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:21.660]   we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:24.340]   If you go to livemomentous.com/huberman,
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:26.560]   you'll see many of the supplements described on today's
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:28.860]   and other episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:31.260]   Again, all as single ingredient formulations.
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:32.800]   They ship internationally.
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:34.820]   Their quality is exceedingly high.
[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:38.700]   And by largely focusing on single ingredient
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:41.580]   and various dosages of different supplements,
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:44.680]   you can create the optimized supplement protocol for you.
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:47.380]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:50.400]   we are Huberman Lab on Instagram and also Huberman Lab
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.240]   on Twitter.
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:53.700]   There, I cover science and science-related tools,
[01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:55.360]   some of which overlaps with the content
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.840]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast and other of which,
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.240]   I should say much of which is distinct
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:01.480]   from the information covered on this podcast.
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:04.400]   If you're interested in obtaining protocols or summaries
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:07.160]   from these podcasts, you can get those completely free
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:09.140]   of cost by going to hubermanlab.com.
[01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:11.260]   Go to the menu at hubermanlab.com.
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:12.900]   Go to the Neural Network Newsletter.
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:14.980]   You simply provide us your email
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:16.540]   and you'll get the Neural Network Newsletter
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:17.860]   for free each month.

[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:22.220]   at hubermanlab.com.
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:25.300]   For instance, toolkit for sleep or deliberate cold exposure
[01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:26.480]   and so on and so forth.
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:28.860]   Again, we don't share your email with anybody.
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:31.340]   So our privacy policy is made very clear there
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:32.980]   and it's completely zero cost.
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:35.140]   So thank you for joining me today for our discussion
[01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:38.740]   about tools for optimizing sleep and in doing so,
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:41.380]   tools for optimizing not just sleep,
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:44.360]   but your daytime feelings of alertness and focus
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:45.780]   and your overall health.
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:47.900]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:49.660]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:52.240]   [upbeat music]
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.820]   (upbeat music)
