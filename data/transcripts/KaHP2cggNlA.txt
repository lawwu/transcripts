[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   At the moment, you recall that we are considering the eighteenth verse in the first chapter
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.600]   of Paul's epistle to the Romans, another of these pivotal statements which he makes
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:23.000]   here at the very beginning as he begins to expound and to unfold the great theme of the
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.440]   epistle.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:31.120]   And the statement is, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.360]   and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.040]   Now we began a consideration of this great theme, this great and solemn subject of the
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.600]   wrath of God last Friday evening.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.680]   We indicated how many people stumble at this and how there is a tendency to avoid it in
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.280]   almost every section of the Christian church, evangelical Christians included, so that we
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.040]   spent most of our time in establishing the fact that this is a very essential biblical
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.720]   doctrine.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.480]   We pointed out, for instance, how in this one epistle the apostle uses this word ten
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.200]   times in this magnificent, mighty statement of the gospel.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.640]   The apostle introduces the theme of the wrath of God on ten separate occasions.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.540]   And we found that it is characteristic also of all his other epistles.
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.720]   We find it in the writings of the other apostles.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.380]   We find it in the preaching of the book of Acts.
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.980]   We find it in the ministry of our blessed Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ himself.
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:53.400]   And then I ended by saying that all that then becomes still clearer when you read the history
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.200]   of the church, and especially when you read about the greatest evangelists that the church
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.020]   has ever known, the men whom God has used in a most striking manner.
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.160]   You will find that invariably they gave great prominence to this doctrine of the wrath of
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.160]   God.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:20.220]   Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Knox, the great Puritans, Whitefield, Wesley, Jonathan Edwards,
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:29.540]   Spurgeon, they have all laid great emphasis upon this central and all-important doctrine.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.620]   Very well, then, having said that, we must now go on to say this, that it is of course
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.220]   important that we should be clear in our minds as to what is meant by the term wrath, the
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.940]   wrath of God.
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.540]   And oftentimes the misunderstanding arises, because we will think of it, of course, as
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:00.820]   very natural in a sense, but very wrong, in terms of wrath in human beings.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.940]   And whenever we think of wrath, we think of it as some kind of rage.
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.740]   The very term seems to convey to us a lack of control, a man almost beside himself.
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.500]   Well, now, obviously it does not mean that.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   Any such thing in the character of God is unthinkable.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.460]   So that wrath means God's hatred of sin.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.380]   Now that is a term that we must use.
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.260]   God hates sin.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.780]   Sin is abhorrent to God.
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.460]   Now there should be no difficulty about the term hate.
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.180]   If you recognize love in God, you must recognize hate also.
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.300]   All that is opposed to God is hateful to God.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.580]   All that belongs to the realm of darkness and of sin and of Satan is abhorrent to God.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.180]   And what the wrath of God means is God's view of sin, God's hatred of sin, and God in his
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.340]   justice and his righteousness dealing with sin and punishing sin.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.420]   Now that is what is taught about this matter in the Bible.
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.860]   Now there is no need to argue about this, although we could argue very easily.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.340]   There are many arguments that I could put before you to show you how essential this
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.340]   doctrine is.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.020]   For instance, it is quite clear that the very character and being of God as holy makes this
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.620]   doctrine quite inevitable.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.580]   You cannot mix light and darkness.
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.540]   You cannot conceive of sin as existing in the presence of God.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.540]   God's holiness insists upon this doctrine of the wrath of God.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.820]   God must deal with it.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.200]   God must show his hatred of it.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.580]   It is a part of his own holiness and his own greatness and glory that he should do so.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.880]   And there are various other arguments that one could adduce in order to show how essential
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.100]   this is.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.580]   But I say I am not going to do so for this reason.
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:23.100]   That we are told here that the wrath of God is revealed, has been revealed, from heaven
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:32.260]   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.100]   Now this is a very important point.
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:44.460]   We can no more prove by ordinary arguments the wrath of God than we can prove the gospel
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.100]   of God's redeeming grace in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.500]   You cannot prove the gospel.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.180]   If a man just insists upon a kind of mathematical proof, you cannot prove the gospel to him.
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.220]   In exactly the same way, you cannot prove the doctrine of the wrath of God.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.740]   But you notice that Paul uses the same term with regard to both of them.
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.060]   He has told us in the seventeenth verse that the glory of the gospel is that therein is
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:20.580]   the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, or the righteousness of God by faith
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.020]   is revealed to faith.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:29.220]   Well now, in exactly the same way, the apostle says that the wrath of God has been revealed
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.340]   also.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.940]   And so you see, this is an exact parallel.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.060]   So if you accept the statement of verse seventeen, you must, to be logical and to be consistent,
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.020]   accept the statement of verse eighteen also.
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.500]   Now the unbeliever, of course, rejects both.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.440]   He doesn't believe, he doesn't accept the statement that the righteousness of God by
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.020]   faith has been revealed.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.580]   He's not interested in that.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.380]   He doesn't even like the term righteousness.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.980]   He doesn't see any need of it.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.380]   So he rejects that.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.980]   And of course, he doesn't believe in the wrath of God either, and he's perfectly consistent.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.620]   But what is utterly inconsistent is to say you believe verse seventeen, but you don't
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.980]   like verse eighteen.
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:21.860]   Because according to Paul, the one is as revealed as is the other.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:28.740]   It is as much revealed as is the righteousness of God by faith.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:38.300]   Therefore I don't hesitate to say this, that ultimately you cannot believe verse seventeen
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.820]   unless you believe verse eighteen also.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:46.660]   Indeed, you'll never see the real need for seventeen if you don't believe eighteen.
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.200]   But these two things go together.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:56.880]   We either accept the revelation of God along all the line, or else we don't.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.740]   But it is really quite monstrous and utterly illogical to accept certain revelations and
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.300]   to reject others.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.980]   That leaves us in the most impossible position of all.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.320]   And that is why it seems to me that the position of all people who are in trouble about this
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:20.020]   doctrine of the wrath of God, but who yet say that they accept God's revelation, is
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.060]   an inconsistent and is an impossible one.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:31.100]   Because the righteousness of God by faith has been revealed, so the wrath of God from
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:38.060]   heaven against all unrighteousness and godliness of men has also been revealed.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.580]   And that is why I say that finally it's not a question of argument.
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.780]   We don't argue these things with the world, we proclaim them.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.860]   We announce them.
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:54.220]   We warn the world concerning them.
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.740]   Very well then, having said that, we can go on to ask this obvious question.
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.460]   How has this wrath of God been revealed?
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.340]   It has been revealed, says Paul, from heaven.
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.580]   What he means by that, of course, is this, that it has been revealed with all the authority
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.400]   of God.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.740]   That it is something which God himself has revealed and has made abundantly plain and
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.740]   clear.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.300]   Now then, how exactly has this wrath of God against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.300]   actually been revealed?
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.940]   Well, there are many answers given in the Bible to that question.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.700]   Let me note some of them, the most important ones.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:42.660]   The wrath of God against all ungodliness and unrighteousness is actually revealed in the
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.660]   conscience.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:49.420]   The fact that all men have a sense of right and wrong is a part of this revelation of
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.540]   the wrath of God.
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:58.460]   Not only that all men have a sense that evil should be punished.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.720]   Of course, they do not think it should be punished when they are the guilty persons,
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.140]   but when it is somebody else, oh yes.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.260]   Now the apostle, of course, works out that argument in the second chapter.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.020]   We shall come to it, God willing.
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.100]   But here it is.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.300]   We start with it at once.
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:18.540]   Their conscience in the meanwhile, excusing or else accusing one another, says Paul.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.980]   Every man has a sense of right and wrong.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:27.700]   Every man feels that sin and evil and transgression should be punished.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.460]   Didn't practically everybody feel at the end of the last war that the leaders of Germany
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:38.700]   during the last war should be brought to book, should be put on trial, and should be punished?
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.860]   People who hate the doctrine of the love of God, they said you can't let a thing like
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.180]   this pass.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:48.220]   So you must have your trial of these war criminals, and they must be dealt with, and they must
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.220]   be punished.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.780]   Now that kind of sense is innate in human nature.
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:58.220]   Most people believe in having a system of law and of government, and that evil doers
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.580]   and offenders should be punished for their transgressions.
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.660]   Now all that is a matter of conscience.
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.500]   Where does it come from?
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.580]   And the answer is it is something that is placed in men by God himself, and also under
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.700]   the same heavy.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.540]   The very fact of remorse is the proof of this.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:25.180]   You can't sin without feeling a sense of misery and of shame, and without knowing something
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.180]   about remorse.
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.180]   It's inevitable, it happens automatically.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.620]   Why should it happen like that?
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.440]   Why should any man when he sins have a feeling that he's done wrong?
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.680]   Why should he be even for a moment unhappy about it?
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.020]   Why should he suffer in that way for it, in his mind?
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:49.860]   That is a part of this self-same activity of conscience, which is a revelation of God's
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:54.100]   wrath against all ungodliness and all unrighteousness.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.100]   But come to a second matter.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:03.420]   The consequences of sin are a manifestation of this also.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:11.040]   And when I say consequences, I'm thinking partly of physical consequences.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.980]   You break certain laws and you'll suffer for it.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.460]   Put your finger in the fire and you'll suffer for it.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.540]   That's a law of nature.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.100]   A transgression of the laws of nature always gives a certain punishment.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.620]   You can't violate the laws of health and ultimately get away with it.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.860]   You'll be made to pay for it in a physical sense.
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:38.860]   There are many sins which even immediately produce physical consequences.
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.460]   Men who drink too much alcohol will pay for it with a headache.
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.580]   That's a physical consequence of sin.
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:51.860]   There are certain others which I needn't mention, where sin immediately and directly leads to
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.340]   physical consequences and to suffering.
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.660]   No, that's not accidental.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.500]   It's God who's ordained that.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.400]   You see, we've got the basis of it all in that third chapter of Genesis that we read
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.780]   at the beginning.
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:10.320]   God ordained that there should be certain consequences following sin.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:16.540]   Because men sinned, certain painful consequences at once came in and they've continued ever
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.540]   since.
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:23.620]   There can be little doubt about that disease and illness in and of themselves are a direct
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.460]   consequence of the original sin and fall of men.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.180]   It's a part of God's revelation of his wrath.
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:39.220]   But then in the third place I would put this very important one again in the third of Genesis.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:47.980]   The whole state of creation and of nature is a revelation of God's wrath against sin.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.260]   You remember what I read about thorns and thistles?
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.940]   Thorns and thistles in creation are the result of sin.
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.920]   It's a part of the punishment of sin.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.180]   It's a part of God's wrath against sin.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.700]   And we are familiar with all this.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.660]   You take the best and the loveliest garden in the world, you neglect it just for a year
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:13.860]   or two and you'll find all sorts of things springing up again and manifesting themselves.
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.620]   It'll become a wilderness in a very short time.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.740]   That's because of the fall.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.220]   That's because of sin.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.140]   God has cursed the ground.
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.460]   And that's a part of the way in which he has done so.
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:34.460]   Then you couple that, of course, with what the Apostle Paul says in Romans 8, from verse
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.460]   18 onwards.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:45.300]   He says, "The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:51.660]   The earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God his
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.660]   own.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.620]   For the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly, but by reason of him that has
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.860]   subjected the same in hope."
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:04.860]   Now, that means that God cursed the earth, and we see it.
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.460]   Nature red in tooth and claw.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.300]   Yes, it's a part of the punishment of sin.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:16.140]   A very important revelation of the wrath of God from heaven, therefore.
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:24.700]   And then, perhaps more important than any of these things, is the fact of the universality
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.460]   of death.
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.580]   Death is universal.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.420]   And that, of course, is again a theme that the Apostle himself takes up in the fifth
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.780]   chapter of this epistle to the Romans.
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:43.460]   You see, this whole epistle, as I've indicated several times, is really nothing but an exposition
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.700]   of what the Apostle is telling us here in verses 16, 17, and 18.
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:54.820]   And in the fifth chapter, he points out how this great fact that death reigned from Adam
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:16:03.400]   to Moses, universally, is a proof of the universality of sin, and therefore a proof of the universality
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.260]   of God's punishment of sin.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:11.660]   So that is a very important aspect of this whole subject.
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.740]   And if we had nothing else, that would be enough in and of itself.
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:24.420]   Death is the result of sin, and it's a part of God's punishment of sin.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:30.740]   In the day God had said to Adam and Eve, "In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shall
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:37.700]   die," there was the possibility for Adam and Eve of not dying.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:43.220]   They lost that because of their sin, and the punishment of sin was death.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.860]   And death has been universal ever since.
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:54.620]   There God reveals his wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:17:00.900]   Then we come on in the fifth place to the way in which history shows the revelation
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.020]   of this wrath of God.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.680]   And here I must subdivide the history into two sections.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:15.940]   First of all, biblical history, and then general history, extra-biblical history.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.140]   It's very plain, isn't it, in biblical history?
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.500]   Just go back again to that third chapter of Genesis.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:33.380]   Adam and Eve punished, driven out of the garden, forced to earn their bread by the sweat of
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:41.740]   their brows, a woman conceiving in pain and in sorrow, and it's continued until today.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.500]   Yes, woman subservient to the men, it's all there.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.500]   Whatever your modern ideas are, that's what the scripture teaches.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:54.160]   And Paul repeats it, you remember, in the second chapter of his first epistle to Timothy.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:00.460]   This is a part of the result of God's wrath upon sin, and if you try to undo that and
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:06.700]   undo what God has there proclaimed, it's just showing that you don't like this idea
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.660]   of the wrath of God, and that you don't believe the scriptures.
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.540]   You see how important it is that we should work these things out in detail.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:20.980]   There you've got it then clearly in the case of Adam and Eve, driven out of the garden
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:27.380]   and the other consequences that have followed, and that are to follow, until sin is finally
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.380]   finished.
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:35.500]   How easily we can be inconsistent sometimes as Christian people because we don't pay
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.560]   attention like this to details.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.680]   Then you go on to the case of Cain.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:45.940]   You see all these things are laid down so plainly in these early chapters of Genesis.
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:51.460]   That's why they're so vital to the whole Christian position, and must never be shed.
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:58.020]   God put a mark upon him, and he punished him in the ways that are described there.
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:06.740]   Then you've got the staggering fact of the flood, so constantly mentioned in the scriptures,
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.900]   even referred to by our Lord himself as they were in the days of Noah.
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.700]   He says, "Even so they shall be."
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:19.540]   And the flood, of course, was nothing but God punishing the sin of mankind and pouring
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:24.140]   out his wrath upon it in a most terrible and terrifying manner.
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.540]   The Tower of Babel is another instance of the same thing.
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.200]   Read of it in the eleventh chapter of Genesis.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.500]   Go on to the nineteenth, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.300]   There it is.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.020]   God destroying the cities of the plain.
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.600]   Our Lord refers to that again.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.220]   And so I could take you through this great biblical history.
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.740]   And then, of course, you've got it in the case of innumerable individuals.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:58.020]   Look how Saul, the first king of Israel, had to suffer because of his sin.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.260]   Oh, how he experienced the wrath of God against sin.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.560]   And look at David, great favorite of God as he was.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.720]   Look how God dealt with him in his sin.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.260]   He had no doubt about the wrath of God against sin.
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:15.940]   For when he's awakened, he says, "Against thee, the only, have I sinned, and done this
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.780]   evil in thy sight."
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.620]   And then read the story of Manasseh.
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:27.140]   Read the story of Nebuchadnezzar, who inflated himself and set himself up as a god.
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:32.300]   And look at him in a short while like an ox eating grass in the fields with his nails
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.940]   like talons and hair on his body.
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:41.260]   God slaught him and struck him down to that because he wouldn't submit himself.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:47.260]   God's wrath against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:53.740]   But of course, the outstanding revelation in this biblical history of God's wrath against
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:59.500]   sin is the whole case of the children of Israel.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.780]   That's the whole story of the Old Testament.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:08.740]   Here they are, a nation created by God for himself.
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.600]   His own peculiar people, his own peculiar possession.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:19.580]   He says they are the apple of his eye, and yet look what happened to them.
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.220]   Look at the way finally they're carried away into the captivity of Babylon.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.220]   What is it?
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.500]   Well, it's God's wrath against sin.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.260]   It doesn't matter whether you're his own chosen people.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:33.820]   If you disobey his laws, if you turn away from him, he'll throw you out, and he threw
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.020]   them out.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:41.820]   It's the great message of the Old Testament, and that is why all this history in the Old
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:45.340]   Testament is of such supreme importance to us.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:51.020]   The New Testament doctrines are perfectly illustrated there in the Old Testament as
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.540]   well as in the New.
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:57.760]   Very well, then, we must always remember that the fate of the children of Israel, not only
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:04.340]   under the old dispensation but still more under the new, what happened in A.D. 70, etc.,
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:11.900]   is simply a terrifying illustration of the wrath of God from heaven against all ungodliness
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.460]   and unrighteousness of men.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:23.660]   He threw them out amongst the nations where they remain even until this evening.
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:29.540]   Well, now there is the biblical history, but of course there's a great deal of general
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:33.660]   history that shows it also.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:39.660]   Read the history of great civilizations, read the story of Tyre and Sidon and other
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:45.740]   nations, and you will find that God has dealt with them.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:51.420]   Indeed, this is a very vital part of our understanding of the Old Testament.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:55.700]   The Old Testament is primarily the story of the children of Israel, but remember that
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.820]   God does tell us something about the other nations as well.
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.740]   Therefore, when you're reading Isaiah or something like that, and the announcement
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.860]   of God's wrath upon the nations, don't skip it over, don't feel it's irrelevant,
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.540]   it's very important.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:14.660]   Here is the key to it, and you see how important it is at a time like this.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:19.280]   God seems to allow these other nations to go so far.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.140]   He allows them to persecute his people, he allows them to become great and mighty and
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:30.300]   successful, but when they tend to stand up against his own ultimate authority, he strikes
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.380]   them down.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:36.820]   What a comfort that should have been to all Christians during the last war.
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:41.000]   We should have known for certain that God would only allow a man like Hitler or anybody
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.620]   like that up to a certain point, but when you pass a certain point, down they go.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:53.340]   God smites them, his wrath is revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:24:00.060]   There is no greater final consolation to God's people in a time of persecution than just
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.380]   that particular doctrine.
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:08.780]   And then, of course, in this very section with which we are dealing, we have this most
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:14.700]   significant statement of the apostles repeated three times, where he says that God gave them
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.620]   up or God gave them over to a reprobate mind or something like that.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.340]   I hope to deal with that in detail later on.
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.860]   I just put it here now in order to make this section complete.
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:33.060]   But let us never forget this, that a part of God's way of pouring out his wrath upon
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:41.060]   sin is just to allow people to live as they like for a while and to reap the consequences.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:47.620]   I believe profoundly that that is what is happening in the world at the present time.
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:53.540]   It is an illustration of this great principle taught in this first chapter of Paul's epistle
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.380]   to the Romans.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:02.580]   But then let me come to my sixth main heading as to how this wrath of God has been revealed.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:08.100]   It is revealed, of course, not only in the history of the Bible, the Old Testament, it
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.940]   is revealed in the teaching as well.
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.220]   You have got it everywhere in the Psalms.
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.220]   Take the first Psalm.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:20.820]   You have got it even in the first Psalm, where God says, "The ungodly shall not stand in
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.820]   the judgment."
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.460]   There it is.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.140]   Like the chaff, he shall be blown away.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:33.740]   That is judgment, the wrath of God against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.140]   You see, ungodliness and unrighteousness are there in the first Psalm.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:45.220]   The righteous and the ungodly are contrasted, and especially in terms of the judgment.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.940]   Then of course, in a sense, there is nothing else in the prophetical books but just this
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.860]   teaching.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.580]   The prophets had only one message.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:58.140]   It was to go to Israel, whether the northern or the southern kingdom, it does not matter,
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.580]   and to say to them, "Look here, you are God's people, but you are not behaving like
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.020]   God's people.
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.340]   If you persist in your present conduct, God is going to punish you.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.940]   Now, it need not happen.
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:12.540]   If you repent, if you return, if you come back to God, he will forgive you and bless
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.540]   you again.
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:18.620]   But if you do not, well, then he will raise an enemy against you, and he will destroy
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.620]   you."
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:25.660]   And every single prophet repeats that message in various forms, some long, some short, with
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.660]   all these illustrations.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.620]   That is all they are saying.
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.260]   They warned them and repeated the warning.
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:36.420]   The nation would not listen, and at last, as I have reminded you, the judgment descended
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.420]   upon them.
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:43.540]   But the teaching of the prophets is always in terms of this mighty doctrine of the wrath
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:44.540]   of God.
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:54.260]   It is all a variant, as it were, on the theme of this day of vengeance of our God against
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:59.100]   all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:09.820]   Well, the wrath of God, says the apostle to the Romans here, has been revealed from heaven
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:18.220]   in those various ways, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:22.140]   in unrighteousness.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:30.700]   But I believe he had something else in his mind, something further, something greater
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:37.580]   than it all, something that is hinted at in the Old Testament but not made explicit until
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.460]   you come to the New, as it were.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.460]   And what is that?
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:52.420]   Well, this is the cross, the death of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:28:01.100]   There is nothing, there is nothing in history anywhere which in any way approximates to
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:13.220]   this as a revelation of the wrath of God against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:19.260]   That is why, my friends, you do a greater injustice to the cross when you sentimentalize
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.940]   it almost than when you deny it.
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:29.980]   If you do not see the wrath of God as you look at the cross on Calvary's hill, it is
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:34.860]   very certain that you do not see the love of God either.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:39.100]   It is there you see the wrath of God really revealed.
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.100]   What does it mean?
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:50.820]   It means this, that God's attitude towards sin is such that he cannot pretend he has
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:57.500]   not seen it, that he cannot just say, "Very well, I will not punish you."
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:06.020]   God's attitude to sin demanded the death of his only begotten Son.
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:10.820]   God's hatred of it, his abhorrence of it, his determination to punish it, his righteous
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:16.060]   demand upon it was such that Christ had to come into this world not to tell us that God
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.060]   is love.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.980]   God had said that repeatedly through the prophets and others.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:24.900]   That was already known.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:32.380]   But to bear the wrath of God against sin, God must punish them.
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.900]   The cross proved that.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.260]   The cross would never have happened but for that.
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.060]   Now you see, that is where what happened in the Garden of Gethsemane is so important and
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.060]   significant.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:46.380]   There is our Lord in an agony, sweating drops of blood and saying, "If it be possible,
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.100]   let this cup pass by."
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.100]   What is the cup?
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:53.420]   Well, the death upon the cross and what he endured there.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.540]   Why does he ask that?
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:58.660]   Well, because he knew what it would mean to him.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.340]   But he submits and says, "Nevertheless, thy will be done, not mine."
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.260]   The cup did not pass by.
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.860]   He had to drink it to the very dregs.
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.860]   What was it?
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.620]   Well, God's punishment of sin.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:16.660]   It made him cry out, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.220]   What was happening at that moment?
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:27.260]   He was experiencing the wrath of God against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:33.940]   There was never such a revelation of the wrath of God against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.860]   of men as that which took place there.
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.380]   And of course, the apostle, when he was writing this epistle, knew all that.
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.820]   He says, "All this had been revealing it, but here it is.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:50.980]   If anything could have avoided that, it would have been avoided."
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:56.820]   God would not send his Son, his only begotten beloved Son, through such an experience,
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:01.340]   through such an agony, unless it was absolutely essential.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.020]   It was essential.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:13.180]   And it was essential because of this wrath of God against ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.940]   It has been revealed.
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.020]   If you did not know it before, says Paul, you must know it there.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:23.140]   This is the ultimate declaration of it.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:27.380]   And you and I must realize that.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:33.820]   That before we see the love of God in the cross, we must see his wrath.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:37.700]   The two things are always together and you cannot separate them.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:43.260]   It is only as you have some conception of the depth of his wrath that you will understand
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.540]   the depth of his love.
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:55.700]   It was God himself who found the way whereby his own wrath could express itself against
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:03.460]   sin and yet the sinner not be destroyed but rather justified because his own Son had borne
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.460]   the punishment.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:10.620]   Oh, what a revelation of the wrath of God against ungodliness and unrighteousness of
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:11.620]   men.
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:15.540]   And of course the resurrection also reveals it.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:21.940]   Do you remember how the apostle put that when he was preaching in Athens?
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.900]   The times of this ignorance God winked at, "But now commandeth all men everywhere
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:27.900]   to repent."
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:33.540]   Why are they called upon everywhere to repent?
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:39.540]   Well because he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the whole world in righteousness
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:46.380]   by that man whom he hath appointed, of which he hath given witness in that he hath raised
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.940]   him from the dead.
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.140]   The resurrection is a proclamation of what?
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:55.820]   Amongst other things, it is a proclamation of the fact that the world is to be judged
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:00.860]   in righteousness, that the wrath of God is to be revealed against all ungodliness and
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:05.660]   unrighteousness of men, and that Christ is the judge.
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:13.620]   The resurrection is a declaration, therefore, of this tremendous doctrine of the wrath of
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.620]   God.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:22.940]   And then, of course, as you go on and have all your prophecies about the return of our
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:28.700]   Lord and his return to judgment and all that you have in the book of Revelation at the
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.740]   end of the New Testament, it is all a part of the same teaching.
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.380]   The whole Bible teaches it from beginning to end.
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.260]   Everything is looking forward to that day.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:44.380]   The angels that lost their first estate and fell before man was ever created, the devil
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:50.300]   and his angels, they are being reserved against this day of final judgment.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:58.100]   All who sinned, starting with Cain and going on, all are being reserved.
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:03.140]   Those men who sinned before the flood, the spirits in prison, as Peter calls them in
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:06.820]   his first epistle in the third chapter, they are all awaiting this.
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:14.540]   The whole world in sin is awaiting that, the day of judgment, the day of the manifestation
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:18.660]   of the righteous judgment of God, his wrath against evil.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:24.100]   Hence, as we saw last Friday night, how the first note in the apostolic preaching always
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.860]   was, "Save yourselves from this untoward generation.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:33.780]   Flee from the wrath to come."
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.620]   Very well.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:42.300]   What then is the teaching concerning this wrath which has been so revealed?
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:46.700]   I can summarize it like this.
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:58.300]   God's wrath may be manifested against sin immediately, here and now.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.980]   Often has been, as I've shown you from history.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:07.980]   Still is quite frequently, but not always.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.540]   Sometimes it is postponed.
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:16.540]   There is a very interesting statement about this in 1 Timothy 5, verse 24.
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.540]   Listen.
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:27.260]   "Some men's sins are opened beforehand, going before to judgment, and some men they
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:31.300]   follow after."
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.820]   Now that's what that means amongst other things.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.820]   It doesn't only mean that the sins of some men are obvious, others are rather hidden
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.220]   and you're not so sure.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.420]   It does mean that, but it also means the punishment.
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:48.140]   Some are made plain and God punishes.
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.900]   Two men may commit the same sin.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.180]   One has the immediate physical consequences, the other has nothing.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.680]   God punishes one immediately.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.660]   In the case of the other, he holds it back and he postpones it.
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:09.380]   The Bible teaches that very plainly and clearly.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:13.220]   Some men seem to be allowed to sin with impunity and nothing ever goes wrong.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:17.340]   The 73rd Psalm is a very great treatise on that subject.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.540]   And there are others, the people before the flood laughed at and ridiculed Noah.
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.160]   They said, "What are you talking about?
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.420]   He was preaching that sort of sermon a hundred years ago.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.940]   You see, he went on a hundred and twenty years warning them and they didn't believe it.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.260]   And they said, "It's never going to happen."
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.780]   And some of them died before it did happen, but it did happen.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.980]   And that's the great message of the Bible.
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:43.180]   It may be immediate, not of necessity, but it will come.
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.580]   It's going to come.
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.980]   It is absolutely certain.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:57.740]   There is to be a last judgment, a final judgment, an ultimate, a last assailant.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:05.220]   And let's be quite clear about this, it will be eternal.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.540]   God's punishment of sin is eternal.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:13.820]   If you believe in eternal life, you must believe in eternal destruction.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:17.020]   The parallels are used everywhere in the Scripture.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:22.820]   There is nothing in the Scripture about another chance, another hope, another opportunity
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:23.820]   beyond death.
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:27.140]   There is nothing about conditional immortality.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.980]   It's everlasting destruction out of the presence of the Lord.
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.180]   People have tried to say that you can get out of this by means of language.
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.180]   You can't.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.220]   The terms are parallel everywhere.
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:43.020]   And the whole sense and meaning of the Scripture makes it quite plain and unmistakable.
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.020]   It is everlasting.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:59.220]   And God's wrath against sin reveals and manifests itself as death, not only physical death,
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.940]   but still more terrible spiritual death.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:12.900]   The wages of sin, says the sixth chapter, verse 23 of Romans, the wages of sin is death.
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:20.940]   But the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.020]   What a terrible thing.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:28.500]   The wrath of God against sin then manifests itself in that which is the opposite of eternal
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:35.700]   life, which means sharing the life of God and the enjoyment of the life of God.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.700]   But there it is.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.460]   It is perfectly plain.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:47.180]   Those who die in their sins, their works will follow them.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:53.660]   And the punishment they shall receive is just to be shut out of the presence of God to all
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.660]   eternity.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:39:02.140]   Oh, that's why the apostle puts this at the beginning, "If that is the fate of the ungodly
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.740]   and it is."
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.740]   What a wonderful, what a glorious thing it is that we also know that this other thing
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:18.340]   has been revealed, the righteousness provided by God himself in Jesus Christ.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:23.940]   So that though I am a hell-deserving sinner, without a single claim on God or his love
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:30.940]   or his compassion or mercy or clemency, though I have no claim, while I was yet a sinner,
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:39.540]   while I was yet an enemy, he sent his Son to die for my sins, that I might be reconciled
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:48.620]   to him and that I might have eternal life and that I might enjoy him forever and forever
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:53.060]   in eternity.
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:56.220]   Very well, we must leave it at that for this evening.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:03.060]   You see, we have still got to go on to consider against what this wrath of God is revealed,
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.020]   what these terms mean.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:11.380]   But oh, let us lay hold on what we have seen together once more.
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:15.500]   This is not a matter of discussion, it's not a matter of argument.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:22.340]   The wrath of God belongs with the love of God and the salvation of God in Christ.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.540]   It has been revealed.
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.020]   Man doesn't like it.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.260]   He never would have thought it out.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.700]   He hates it.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:35.100]   But our preaching does not depend upon man, nor his reason, nor his understanding, nor
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.260]   his likes, nor dislikes.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.660]   It is what God has revealed.
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:48.980]   And as he has revealed his righteousness as a gift, he has revealed his wrath against
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:57.900]   all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men that hold down the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.900]   Let us pray.
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:15.100]   Oh Lord, our God, we come again before thee, conscious, oh God, of the greatness of this
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:24.740]   life which thou hast given us, that such tremendous and eternal consequences depend upon what
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:28.580]   we do and believe in this life and in this world.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:37.540]   Oh God, wilt thou grant unto us all by thy Holy Spirit a sense of these things.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:41.420]   Open our understanding, oh Lord.
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:46.380]   We feel we are so superficial, we are so foolish.
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:50.860]   We would pick and choose out of thy word and its revelation.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:58.980]   Oh God, help us to see that we must submit ourselves to it entirely and completely.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:06.140]   We desire to praise and to worship thee and to thank thee, oh God, that while we deserve
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:12.780]   nothing but wrath, thou hast looked upon us in mercy and compassion.
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:20.540]   Thou hast reconciled us unto thyself in Jesus Christ and clothed us with his righteousness
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:27.900]   and adopted us into thy family and are preparing us for the enjoyment of that eternal bliss
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.180]   that thou hast awaiting us.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:37.980]   Oh God, receive our humble praise and so shed thy love abroad in our hearts that we may
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:44.260]   begin to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:52.900]   the height of thy love to us in Christ Jesus, our blessed Lord and Saviour.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:59.060]   And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:05.380]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:12.460]   the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:16.060]   shall see him face to face.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.500]   Amen.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.420]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
