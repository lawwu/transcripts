[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.920]   - That hit everything except this whole,
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.860]   this kind of looming topic of icebreakers.
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.320]   And I think anyone listening right now
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.480]   is kind of wondering, oh gosh,
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.940]   like what does Nick mean when he says icebreakers?
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.160]   - Yeah, and why do icebreakers?
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.640]   Aren't those silly?
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.480]   Aren't those childish?
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.280]   Well, we do icebreakers
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.880]   because it's a short survey of the room.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.880]   And icebreakers also not only give your guests excuses
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.280]   to go meet new people, which by the way,
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.240]   that's why your party is going to be very successful.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.320]   And that's why your friends will love you for hosting this
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.540]   because you are going to help them meet new people.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.200]   Most adults haven't made a new friend
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.800]   in the last three years.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.480]   And yet as we get older,
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.160]   we need friends more than ever, right?
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.320]   Friends become like a game of attrition.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.320]   They have kids, they move, things happen.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.260]   We don't see people as often.
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.840]   Your party will be successful
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.240]   because all of your guests
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.640]   are gonna talk to a lot of new people.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.720]   How do we encourage that by using these icebreakers?
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.920]   Icebreakers are a short survey of the room.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.560]   Generally, you'll go around the circle,
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.480]   you'll say your name,
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.700]   you'll say what you do for work.
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.800]   If you don't wanna say for work,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.800]   you say something you're excited about.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.720]   And then the third one,
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.800]   which is the icebreaker question, okay?
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.560]   So each icebreaker has three parts,
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.080]   name, what you do for work,
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.640]   and then the icebreaker question, right?
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.440]   You'll do three rounds of icebreakers.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.440]   I think of icebreakers as a green, yellow, red scaffolding
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600]   where you would wanna start your party
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.000]   with a green-level icebreaker.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.240]   A green-level icebreaker, the one that I use,
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.000]   that I suggest everybody use for the first one,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.600]   is what is one of your favorite things
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.180]   to eat for breakfast?
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.880]   So first, how does that hit with you?
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.720]   What are your thoughts?
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.540]   I'm ready for it.
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.600]   If you hate it, then tell me,
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.840]   and I'll tell you why it's great,
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.720]   but I just wanna hear your thoughts.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.200]   - I mean, I don't actually eat breakfast that often, so--
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.000]   - Because why not?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.880]   Why don't you choose to eat breakfast?
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.880]   - Uh, I, I don't know, I just--
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.200]   - You just skip, it's not for health reasons,
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.480]   you're not intermittent fasting, you're just,
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.640]   I'm just lazy.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.600]   - I am just, I forget.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.920]   - Sometimes it's been intermittent fasting,
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.640]   sometimes it's just been like, I don't wanna,
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.680]   it's just one more thing to think about during the day.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.800]   - Yes, yeah.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.180]   - Now, when you do eat breakfast,
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.820]   what's one of your favorite things to eat for breakfast,
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.140]   when you do?
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.240]   - I mean, when I do eat breakfast,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.280]   it's usually like some ridiculous,
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.460]   like make an amazing breakfast for the weekend
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.080]   kind of thing, like lemon ricotta pancakes, or--
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.640]   - Are you, lemon ricotta pancakes, are you kidding me?
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.760]   - That's like a go-to, you know,
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.600]   once a month kind of thing in our house.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.480]   - I've asked this icebreaker hundreds of times,
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.020]   I've never heard somebody say lemon ricotta pancakes,
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.760]   that's incredible.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.680]   - Yeah, 'cause I think it's like,
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.800]   I don't make a lot of breakfast,
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.240]   so if I do make breakfast, I'm gonna, you know,
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.160]   step it up, and I have this recipe,
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.020]   now I feel like I should put it in the show notes,
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.060]   that I think is just like,
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.000]   every time I make these lemon ricotta pancakes,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.620]   and they're not that hard, it just wins every time.
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.920]   - Wait, now I gotta know,
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.060]   what, like, how long does it take you to make them?
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.460]   Okay, look, if we're doing this at my party,
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.000]   I just wanna show you right there, what just happened.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.500]   You expressed a piece of your personality,
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.260]   that you share and you make your secret thing,
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.120]   lemon ricotta pancakes.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.040]   Now, you might not always eat breakfast,
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.840]   but you did get to share when you do make breakfast,
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.700]   what you make, okay?
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.760]   Everybody chooses or not chooses
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.040]   to eat breakfast every single day,
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.080]   and it is generally a positive, happy feeling that we have.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.520]   A good green-level icebreaker
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.080]   is an icebreaker that's quick to answer,
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.960]   it's fast, and it doesn't incur judgment from others.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.240]   A bad green icebreaker, which I would never do,
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.520]   would be something like,
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.880]   say your name, say what you do for work,
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.360]   and say your favorite book ever, okay?
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.420]   Because that's subjective, that's definitive,
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.360]   that's very hard to pick,
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.000]   it's going to maybe elicit a little bit of judgment,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.580]   people are gonna try to show off, they don't know.
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.800]   Now, how do we modify that, right?
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.640]   It's what I said,
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.080]   what's one of your favorite things to eat for breakfast?
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.600]   I still wouldn't ask, what's one of your favorite books?
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.920]   I would ask that later,
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.760]   because a book is an intellectual thing, right?
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.160]   Breakfast is a human, delicious thing,
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.120]   it's a fun thing, it's an easy thing.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.260]   So we ask that as just a way for everybody at your party
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.720]   to sort of sound off
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.280]   and express a piece of their personality.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.520]   You do it very quick, a good icebreaker is a quick icebreaker
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.640]   so you're not going to allow for follow-up questions
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.280]   like I was drilling you on, right?
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.420]   You're just gonna have everybody go around.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.160]   And then you just say, all right, thanks everybody,
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.200]   I do those icebreakers
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.360]   so we can all meet somebody new maybe,
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.460]   I hope you'll say hello.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.840]   And then you as a host shut up,
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.020]   and you just let the party go,
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.340]   which is so awkward as a new host,
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.000]   if you've never done this, you're like this is terrifying.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.040]   But then you do it and the room explodes, it comes alive,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.000]   people go up and they talk to new people,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.320]   you turn the music back up
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.080]   and everybody's making these conversations.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.800]   So we do that because most parties you go to,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   you just went to your kid's birthday party recently,
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.760]   they didn't do icebreakers,
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.680]   you just maybe you bumped into somebody
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.600]   and started the conversation.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.440]   I'm guessing, right?
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.280]   It's just physical proximity.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.940]   - Don't let your kid drink that juice box
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.460]   'cause my daughter just threw it on the ground.
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.920]   Like that was our icebreakers.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.140]   - Yes, yes.
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.260]   And there's nothing wrong with those,
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.000]   those are fine gatherings.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.540]   But for listeners of your show,
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.080]   they're interested in how to get more out of life,
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.640]   they're interested in optimizing things.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.440]   And as cliche and as ridiculous as it sounds
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.860]   to optimize your social situations,
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.460]   it does help if the goal
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.740]   is to help your friends make more friends,
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.260]   to do a survey of the room,
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.420]   do a couple of them during your party,
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.780]   to give people excuses to go start a new conversation.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.040]   Because by the way,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.000]   the other reason we do icebreakers
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.280]   is it gives people an easy excuse
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.100]   to end their conversations.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.380]   - So are you doing these like every 30 minutes,
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.020]   you kind of pop into an icebreaker and then turn it off?
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.860]   - That's exactly right.
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.920]   You do them every 30 minutes,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.080]   you're gonna do them three times
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.920]   throughout your party, two or three times.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.800]   And they should only take five or so minutes.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.140]   By the way, a hack that everybody needs to know,
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.760]   the icebreakers, you have to be standing.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.680]   You cannot let people sit down.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.520]   It is the kryptonite to a successful,
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.460]   you can't do icebreakers sitting down.
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.120]   People will ask follow-up questions, they'll drone on.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.120]   A good icebreaker is a fast one.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.080]   - You said you go from green to yellow to red.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.560]   What are the more advanced ones?
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.040]   And do you have people,
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.320]   because people are coming and going,
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.000]   do you redo the names and the works each time?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.720]   - Yes, you redo the names, you do that for all of them.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.240]   So your first icebreaker,
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.500]   I'll get into the details with you.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.300]   Your first icebreaker you're gonna do
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.860]   when there's only five or six people who've shown up.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.620]   And that is what I call lovingly
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.140]   the awkward zone at a party.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.900]   It's the first 10 or 20 minutes
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.700]   when not many people are there.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.600]   It's a little bit awkward.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.900]   There's not enough energy in the room.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.160]   You do the icebreaker to bust out of the awkward zone.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.940]   You're gonna do that same icebreaker about 20 minutes later
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.880]   when now everybody has arrived.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.280]   And then 30 minutes later,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.960]   you'll do your last and final icebreaker.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.440]   And what I like to ask is,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.640]   say your name, say what you do for work,
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.200]   and then say one of the favorite pieces of media
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.680]   that you've consumed over the last couple months.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.760]   That could be a show on Netflix.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.280]   It could be a podcast like this.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.180]   It could be a great book that you read,
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.040]   a long form article, a funny meme that you saw,
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.100]   a TikTok video, just a cool piece of media
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.400]   that you consumed and enjoyed.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.440]   And Chris, this one works so well
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.240]   because everybody's sharing great recommendations
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.080]   for a book, a movie, something,
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.960]   and people are wanting to write down stuff.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.800]   They're feeling smarter
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.000]   because everybody's sharing these great ideas.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.200]   So I love that one.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.640]   - What about that middle break?
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.960]   Any other tips for icebreakers beyond the two you shared?
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.560]   - One more that you could do,
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.400]   and this is, you've probably seen this online,
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.760]   used for engagement bait,
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.400]   is what is one of your favorite purchases of the last year?
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.440]   It could be a service or an activity,
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.880]   or it could be a physical object that you've purchased.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.520]   Maybe it's a new car, maybe it's a kitchen appliance,
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   but what's one of your favorite purchases
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.240]   that's made your life better during the last year?
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.920]   And people love to share.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.880]   I love this one.
