[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - Welcome, friends, to this episode
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.240]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.000]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.560]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.920]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.960]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.500]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.600]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.880]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.760]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.440]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.320]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.320]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.200]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.460]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.360]   Well, listeners, I'm super excited to talk to you today
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.900]   and to talk to my friend Brittany today
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.280]   about one of my favorite things to do, read.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.120]   I love to read, I've always been a big reader.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.380]   And I have one of my dear friends with me today
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.320]   that I know is also a big reader, Brittany Lewis.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.660]   Brittany, thank you for being with me today on the podcast.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.720]   - Oh, it's my pleasure.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.400]   I love this topic and I love speaking with you.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.480]   - We have so much fun when we're together.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.760]   So you guys who are listening,
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.600]   it may seem like you are eavesdropping
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.520]   on a conversation between two friends
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.080]   'cause we might really get to go in
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.840]   as we talk about reading.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.000]   'Cause I know that we're both pretty jazzed
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.320]   about what reading is and what it can do for us
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.060]   and for our families and for our communities.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.280]   Listeners, I know that some of you are probably
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.880]   big readers yourselves.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.880]   Some of you probably have kids who already love to read,
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.000]   but I'm also aware that there are lots of us homeschoolers
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.160]   who don't particularly enjoy reading
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.160]   or maybe who grew up not really loving to read
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.520]   like we hope our children will.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.620]   And so the conversation today
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.600]   is gonna be all over the place.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.080]   It's not just for people who love to read
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.180]   or have a whole row of books that they're waiting to read.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.180]   It is for people who are wondering what reading together
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.120]   can do for our families and for our homeschools.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.480]   So it really is for everybody,
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.040]   even if you don't think of yourself as a big reader.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.880]   Brittany, let me ask you this question
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.440]   just so everybody can get to know you a little bit.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.340]   Are you a big reader?
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.520]   - Yes, I am a big reader.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.420]   But not everyone in my family is a big reader
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.420]   and there definitely been lots of areas of learning
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.560]   that I did not enjoy reading.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.720]   Some I'm learning to enjoy.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.980]   - Yeah, you mean like there are lots of different things
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.000]   to read and some of them you like to read
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.420]   and some of them not so much, huh?
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.800]   - Yes, yes.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.060]   I think homeschooling's helped me become broader
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.060]   in my interests because I want to help my kids
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.560]   to be able to pursue those natural loves
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.280]   that are different than mine.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.440]   - Oh, that's really good.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.700]   Now you know what, that's a great point.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.940]   That's a way that we can love our kids well
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.540]   if we are willing to read things
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.540]   that aren't particularly winsome or interesting to us
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.800]   because one of our children is bent in that direction.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.320]   That's really good, that's really good.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.440]   Were you always a big reader?
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.540]   Why did you like to read or why do you like to read?
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.520]   - I think when I was little my parents were great
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.840]   about taking me to the library
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.880]   and we actually belonged to a church
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.880]   that just had a fantastic kids section
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.380]   and I was really drawn to the fairy tales
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.720]   and the myths and the old stories
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.620]   and my parents were great about reading those things to me
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.840]   and encouraging us to pick up good books
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.500]   and so that did nourish my mind and encourage me to read.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.520]   I think in spite of my education,
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.760]   which sort of tended to feel like dry
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.260]   and I was just a public school kid.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.060]   Sometimes I would have a good teacher
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.820]   who would want us to read Charlotte's Web together
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.820]   and then other times we would be handed
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.300]   pretty dry canned reading comprehension things
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.880]   that I just wanted to fly through it
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.820]   so I could go to the library
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.520]   and find something worth reading, you know what I mean?
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.580]   - I so know what you mean.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.900]   I had those same teachers.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.080]   I had a teacher in the fifth grade who,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.900]   and a lot of teachers I think believed
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.580]   that once you were in the fifth grade
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.340]   you were too old to be read aloud to.
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.820]   I blessedly had a teacher who did not believe that
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.220]   and when we came back from lunch every day
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.460]   she read us a chapter of Caddy Woodlawn
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.740]   and we had a double classroom
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.740]   and so she held Spellbound between 50 and 60 fifth graders
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.380]   just with her voice reading us that book
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.480]   and I absolutely loved it.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.020]   It was great and I was lucky to have, like you,
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.920]   a parent who took me to the library.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.800]   I can remember my mom taking us downtown to Charlotte
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.320]   on the city bus to go to the big library
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.640]   and I loved checking out books there
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.720]   and at our church library so that's really cool.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.820]   So I can see how that growing up
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.820]   might have made you a reader.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.140]   Why do you like to read now?
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.140]   Now I like to read.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.120]   I think the longer I have homeschooled
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.520]   I just get hungry myself
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.280]   and so as I'm teaching my students,
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.700]   I'm a challenge tutor right now
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.180]   or as I'm just wrestling through something
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.080]   with my youngest who I'm still homeschooling right now,
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.600]   I sometimes just feel like dry in my spirit
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.260]   and I read for pleasure to kind of fill that up
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.160]   or I pursue something I know I need to learn
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.160]   and picking up a book on a subject
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.640]   that I don't particularly love yet
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.720]   but the person who wrote the book loves it
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.560]   and sees all the beauty so just being able to see the world
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.120]   or a subject through their eyes helps me to love it too
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.760]   and be able to pass on that excitement
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.460]   of learning something new to my students or my kids.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.560]   I like that.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.560]   I was gonna ask you what is so great about reading
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.560]   and I love what you just said
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.560]   that you can almost catch the excitement from somebody else.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.760]   If you are reading about a passion that's not yours
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.200]   but you can tap into the author's excitement
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.720]   or understanding or zeal,
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.920]   then you can catch a breath of that.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.540]   That's cool.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.380]   That's true.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.080]   That's a good reason to read.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.920]   What else?
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.640]   What else is so great about reading?
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.400]   What does reading do for us or teach us?
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.240]   I think it helps us.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.200]   I mean, aside from, of course,
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.040]   reading the book of all books, the Bible,
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   which is a living word.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.040]   That is, I'm just assuming that we all agree that
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.540]   that's worth our time, spending that for ourselves
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.360]   and with our kids and then also just reading old books
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.360]   and new books helps us participate in that great conversation
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.880]   that's been going on between human beings for all time
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.720]   because the Lord created us.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.560]   We're Christians.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.560]   We are supposed to be people of the word
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.640]   and to be about words and learning.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.520]   And so I think the more we read,
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.680]   the more we learn about his world
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.740]   and the better we're able to read his word too.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.640]   And also to kind of govern our own words
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.860]   as we learn from others.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.760]   Yeah, that's really good.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.020]   There's a lot to think about there.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.880]   And what you said, I appreciate that.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.880]   You shared with me one time an Isaac Watts quote
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.340]   that reminds me about this.
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.460]   Will you share it again?
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.300]   Sure, yes.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.860]   I've been researching him.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.880]   He was a great hymn writer and pastor, Isaac Watts.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.820]   And he also wrote a logic book
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.200]   and was the authority for lots of Ivy League schools
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.180]   and schools across the Atlantic too for many years.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.060]   So that's interesting.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.380]   I didn't know that about him.
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.240]   But he wrote a book called "The Improvement of the Mind"
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.280]   and in it, he was just expressing some general rules
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.600]   for the improvement of knowledge.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.480]   And this book actually influenced
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.100]   the great scientist Michael Faraday
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.540]   and his development of the scientific method.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.860]   Isn't that wonderful?
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.700]   That's cool.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.240]   Who would have thought that a scientist
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.260]   and a hymnist would be connected
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.720]   in what they think about learning and reading?
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.000]   Right, and he begins his rules
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.920]   for the improvement of knowledge with this quote.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.060]   So I'll read it to you.
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.900]   Yeah.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.080]   He says, "No man is obliged to learn and know everything.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.320]   This can neither be sought nor required
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.280]   for it's utterly impossible.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.500]   Yet all persons are under some obligation
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.820]   to improve their own understanding.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.640]   Otherwise it will be a barren desert
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.460]   or a forest overgrown with weeds and brambles.
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.280]   Universal ignorance or infinite errors
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.540]   will overspread the mind, which is utterly neglected
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.340]   and lies without any cultivation."
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.100]   So that image of that metaphor that he says,
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.440]   if we don't continue to learn that our minds
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.760]   can become a barren desert
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.800]   or a forest overgrown with weeds and brambles,
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.340]   I thought, wow, that sounds really biblical.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.460]   I think I need to keep reading.
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.900]   That's been an encouraging thing
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.900]   to learn from someone in the past like Isaac Watts.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.420]   I've actually been sharing like one of his,
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.300]   I think it's 12 rules.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.860]   And so I've been sharing one rule a week
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.820]   with my challenge students right now
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.780]   as we've been thinking about just being humble
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.020]   before the things we're learning
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.180]   and continuing to read and to learn.
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.500]   That's a great idea.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.000]   I bet your challenge students,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.060]   that gives them something good to chew on,
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.100]   too.
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.740]   I like that because it helps us.
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.100]   You know, Brittany, as homeschooling parents,
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.180]   when our kids are little,
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.580]   reading is all about giving them that skill
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.620]   of decoding these letters and these sounds
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.100]   so that they can read.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.340]   And as home educators,
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.180]   we feel like reading is kind of the gateway skill
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:24.180]   that makes everything else approachable and open to you.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.640]   But the whole idea that reading stays important,
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:35.100]   even after you learn how to do it, right,
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:40.100]   that it stays important because it's how your mind
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:46.280]   grows and flourishes and adds new ideas.
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:53.460]   I love the whole image of books tickling your mind.
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:58.980]   You know, when I was, you know,
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.220]   when children are ticklish, you know,
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.520]   you can just tickle them and it stimulates them
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.260]   and it makes them move and jerk and giggle or shriek
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.740]   or run or cuddle or whatever.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.800]   It provokes you.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.700]   And I think that that's why reading is like
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.660]   tickling my mind.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.780]   It provokes my mind in new directions.
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:22.700]   It either provokes me to reject something
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.900]   or to grab a hold of it or to look at it
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.460]   or to laugh at it or to argue with it.
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.440]   I just, the Isaac Watt quote of the whole idea
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.000]   that your mind might become a barren desert
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   without taking in new ideas is really cool to me.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.060]   - It is.
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.260]   I was struck recently by one of my students
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.860]   said, what do you have to do to a garden
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.620]   to get it full of weeds?
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.780]   Nothing.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.780]   And I went, oh yes, yes, that is right.
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.500]   That is right.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.620]   - Oh wow, that's very profound.
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.660]   That's very profound.
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.280]   So listeners, you don't want to do nothing
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   and let your precious gardens be ruled by weeds.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.280]   And so don't just teach your children to read though.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   Read with them, read good things with them.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.120]   Like Brittany said, old books as well.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.120]   Think of the great conversations
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.480]   that have already happened in the world.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.960]   I don't want to be left out of some
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.520]   of those great conversations.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.080]   And the only way to get in on it at this point
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.040]   is to read those old books.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.400]   That's cool.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.600]   - That's right.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.320]   So how do we get kids interested in reading?
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.060]   So we've taught them how to read
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.520]   and they become proficient readers.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.300]   And some kids I think are like we were
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.500]   as little girls, Brittany.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.160]   We were just into, I used reading and fairy tales
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   and mystery stories and legends as escape literature
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.680]   and just the world of the mind.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.320]   I lived in my imagination.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   I went on a thousand trips as a child just from reading.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.520]   But how do we get kids who maybe are just learning
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.560]   how to read well enough that they could enjoy
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.040]   pleasure reading on their own or any kind of reading?
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.640]   How do we get kids interested in reading?
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.880]   What's been your experience?
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.400]   - Well, my experience has been rocky actually.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.660]   I mean, like it's been difficult at times
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.240]   because two of my three kids are dyslexic.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.160]   So reading didn't come as naturally
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.440]   as it did to one of my kids.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.680]   And so it was extra challenging.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.080]   And, but I also think it was,
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.400]   I'm so grateful for all of those extra days
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.960]   and hours of reading together side by side
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.160]   of me reading to them.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.840]   And then for a much longer time period,
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.540]   way past the fifth grade, having them read to me.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.560]   Even now, I mean, I love listening to my daughter
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.880]   who's in challenge three read out loud.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.820]   And we do that regularly in seminar
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.840]   where we are reading something together
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.320]   and to listen to it out loud together
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.120]   and to practice reading together.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.880]   I've found even with adults in book clubs,
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.820]   it's good to practice.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.620]   It helps us get better as we read aloud together.
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.620]   But I think trying to set aside time each day
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.680]   where we give our students, our children at home,
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.700]   the best stories, sitting side by side,
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.980]   doing what we can to make it enjoyable.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:47.120]   I know I did things in my house, like we did a morning time,
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.880]   which I know that a lot of our CC families
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.480]   are familiar with and Scribblers in particular
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.200]   does such a wonderful job of encouraging
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.880]   a morning time of reading.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.720]   That was really foundational to my kids
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.600]   to help them love reading and love stories.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.580]   And even though for some of my children,
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.960]   it was harder for them to,
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.320]   they could really struggle against just anxiety over reading
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.880]   or frustration or even humble feelings
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.120]   of I'm not smart enough to do this kind of a fear,
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.680]   which wasn't true, but something they had to battle.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.400]   In spite of all of that, my kids would say
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.000]   that they don't regret any of it,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.600]   that they're really grateful.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.680]   They still love to read, but they went through times
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.120]   where they didn't want to read.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.840]   And I worried about it, that they weren't naturally drawn
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.960]   to when they had time not studying to go read a book.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.200]   I really worried about that,
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.700]   but I think their souls were just full.
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.940]   - Maybe it was time just to think about what they had read
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.680]   or what you had read together.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.660]   - Yeah, or go play.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.320]   I mean, just the mind continues to work on those things.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.760]   - That is so true.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.280]   That's really, that's good.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.720]   That's very good.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.720]   I know that I had one daughter who loved to read
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.400]   and she immersed herself in stories,
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.160]   and one who loved to read as a family.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.720]   She loved reading aloud time and story time.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.840]   And like you, we continued to do it well into high school.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.300]   So we read aloud as a family.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.000]   We still, actually we still read aloud as a family
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.360]   and my girls are grown and married
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.040]   with families of their own.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.640]   But when they come home for holidays,
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.200]   we still read aloud together.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.260]   So even my daughter who did not love reading
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:52.260]   as much as her sister found a lot of warm fellowship
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:58.100]   in reading together and it drew our family together.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:03.100]   And I know that she and I read a lot of the challenge,
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:08.140]   upper challenge literature together
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.060]   because I had not done as much of that
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.220]   with my older daughter.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.380]   And I felt like I had missed something.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.500]   And so she was gracious enough
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.220]   to share the read aloud time with me.
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:23.220]   And it was a real bonding experience for us.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:28.780]   I felt like I got to know her as I saw her reactions
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.100]   to things that we were reading together.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.360]   And I wouldn't trade anything for that.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.880]   - I agree, that has been our experience too.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.760]   And I think it creates like a shared culture.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:47.980]   There's jokes my kids say to one another
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.560]   because of stories we've read
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.520]   or audio books we've listened to or dramatized things
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.780]   that we've listened to and enjoyed together
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.960]   that just creates a whole family culture
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.560]   and those close relationships
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.760]   because you spent that time listening
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.720]   and imagining together.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.800]   - Yes, yes.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.940]   And asking the what if questions
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.960]   and why did this have to happen questions
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.840]   and why did that character do that
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.600]   and what else could have been said or done.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.600]   - Yeah, I think that is one of the benefits,
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.200]   I think of reading together
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   is that you get somebody to go back and forth with.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.880]   And another big benefit to me of reading together
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.640]   is that you get the benefit of somebody else's point of view.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.760]   I know sometimes I read something
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.280]   and it hits me a certain way
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.700]   and I will say out loud what I got from that
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.040]   or how that character seemed to me
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.080]   or what that argument either was persuasive or wasn't.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.880]   And I'm always for some reason shocked to find
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.840]   that somebody else thought differently.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.680]   Somebody else got a different message from that story
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.440]   or had a different problem with the logic used
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.840]   in an argument than I did.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.600]   And so one of the benefits
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.680]   is just getting somebody else's perspective.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.920]   Does that ever happen to y'all, Brittany?
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.800]   Do you like all the same things that your kids like?
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.700]   - No, I don't love all of the same thing.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.960]   We're, interestingly enough,
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.520]   the Lord just really gives us children
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.840]   that are very different from us.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.220]   And that's been such a gift. - Isn't it funny?
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.620]   - Yeah, yes, it has been a good thing.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.620]   I have enjoyed learning about rockets
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.780]   and historical battles
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:54.900]   and things that I wasn't naturally drawn to with my son.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.980]   I've enjoyed trying to become more of a lover
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.800]   of the natural world and science with my second born,
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.180]   my daughter who is going to nursing school.
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.340]   And I've enjoyed learning about all kinds
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:13.340]   of hands-on type arts and cooking and baking
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:17.800]   and things that maybe I was drawn to too,
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.760]   but it's been fun to experience that with my youngest
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.760]   who's artistic and loves to learn about all kinds of things
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.640]   that are drawing her as well.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.840]   And that gives me a broader perspective
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.140]   and a way to love her better too,
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.160]   to participate in that with her.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.160]   - I asked my kids like,
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.740]   "What are your favorite stories we read?"
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.460]   And they all had such a variety of answers.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.200]   It was fun to hear that certain things stood out
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.860]   as their favorite and they were all different.
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.560]   That was really fun.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.080]   - Isn't that great?
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.980]   I like that.
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.440]   I like something that you just said.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.480]   I'd like to chase that rabbit for a minute.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.160]   You said that reading with your children
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.960]   helped you to know them better and love them better
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.800]   and appreciate them more.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.520]   In what way is that true?
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.100]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:18.100]   I think in reading things that my kids
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.280]   were naturally drawn to that I wasn't,
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.020]   I was able to figure out kind of their bent,
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.140]   like the way that the Lord had crafted them
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.760]   and always been praying and like looking for where,
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.440]   what is this child going to become?
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.160]   Where are they called to be used in the world
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.260]   and where will they go?
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.100]   What will they do?
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.360]   What will they love and pursue?
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.980]   And that's been a wonderful gift.
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.980]   My son is interested in all kinds of things that as a kid,
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:54.840]   he loved the old anything heroic hero type stories
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.720]   and often things that were really challenging
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.760]   and even frightening to me, he thrived on it.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.400]   I remember him coming to me one day and saying,
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.360]   "Mom, give me a mission."
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.940]   And I thought, who is this child my son is becoming?
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:16.140]   But you could see it in the things that he was interested in
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.800]   and at the same time is very musical too.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   So that was just, our home is filled with guitars
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.720]   and piano and I didn't grow up in a house like that.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.100]   We love music, but my youngest is following
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.200]   in her brother's footsteps and that,
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.500]   learning how to do those things.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:40.100]   And yeah, I just think reading together,
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.240]   we start to have glimmers into our kids' souls
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.260]   that we wouldn't have known otherwise.
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.600]   So if we have sharp eyes and prayerful spirits,
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.340]   I think the Lord is good to show us that,
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.700]   to show where we need to encourage them.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.240]   - That's great.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.080]   That is great.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.380]   That's a really good thing.
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.960]   That's something I'm gonna chew on for a while.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:07.720]   Especially as I'm blessed now to have a grandson
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.740]   who when he was tiny, he would sit in your lap.
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.260]   As long as you would read, he would sit in your lap.
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:21.260]   Now he's about 15 months old now and he has found his legs
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.620]   and he likes to go, go, go.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.240]   But he still likes to hear a story,
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.960]   but when he was really little,
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.240]   he was constantly bringing a book
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.280]   and he would just bring a book and hold his arms up
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.140]   and he wanted you to pick him up and read that book.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:41.340]   And I am looking forward to knowing him
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:47.120]   through his story choices and getting to know him
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.460]   through what he might like to spend time
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.700]   learning about with me.
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.340]   And I kinda wanna, at this point,
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.340]   it just occurred to me that we've talked a lot
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:03.340]   about stories and fairy tales and myths and adventure tales.
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:08.880]   There are lots of other kinds of things that we could read.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.820]   What are some other kinds of things
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.060]   that lend themselves to reading together?
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:21.060]   - I think history and explorations of nature.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.880]   I think biographies are really helpful
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.940]   because we need examples of others.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.520]   There's tons of wonderful missionary biographies
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.520]   and stories of heroes and leaders of the past
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.680]   that are worth our time together.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:45.120]   I know that that can shape us and give us examples
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.060]   from which to draw.
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:53.080]   Poetry, there's all kinds of nonfiction.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:58.280]   I know that we've, at my house, have a wide variety
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.900]   of things that my kids have naturally been interested in.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.080]   So we've given them books for Christmas, for instance,
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.280]   that I thought were beautifully illustrated
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.280]   or particularly appealing to that particular kid.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:15.120]   Some of those things we've ended up sharing together
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.600]   because they were excited to share those things.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.340]   - I think that a lot of times,
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.560]   especially if we as an adult, as a child,
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.840]   if we loved reading fiction and we loved stories
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.880]   and we loved all kinds of adventures,
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.080]   I liked all kinds of stories.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.780]   I liked historical stories.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.600]   I loved biographies when I was a kid.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.700]   I loved mystery stories.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.000]   I loved adventure stories.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.040]   I loved stories of children that were set
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.560]   in other countries, so I like to read about other countries.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.560]   I loved stories, and I think sometimes,
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.660]   if that's what we loved when we were little,
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:02.660]   we don't think about other things to suggest.
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:08.620]   We have a bunch of maps.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.740]   We have books of maps.
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.740]   We have at our house, 'cause my husband is a map-loving man,
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.020]   and so we have a lot of books that trace the history
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.200]   of the world through maps.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.500]   So we have tons of map books,
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.880]   and one of my daughters was really interested
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.880]   in the presidents when she was little,
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.320]   and so we have a lot of biographies of the presidents.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.680]   We have some kid books about the Constitution.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.840]   So these are obviously all nonfiction things,
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.740]   but they were things that my girls really enjoyed,
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.360]   and that you mentioned poetry,
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.800]   and I can remember loving poetry as a child
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.720]   and reading it and reciting it to my girls
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.160]   when they were little, and I did more reciting it to them
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.720]   when they were little, and I don't think they realized
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.420]   for a long time that there could be a book of poems,
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.080]   and we could read these poems in a book,
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:15.000]   and so that was a lot of fun, but I have,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.720]   for years I've been able to speak at practicums
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.460]   around the country, and I've had people come up and say,
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.960]   we had to really look hard to find things
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.680]   that our kids liked to read.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.840]   Some people would say, my kids never liked to read,
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.500]   and I was opposed to it at first,
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.280]   but we've got some graphic novels,
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.560]   what we used to call comic books, and we've read those,
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.120]   and then I had one person that said,
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.120]   my kids were fascinated by names in history
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:54.800]   or in stories that we read, and so we got a book of names
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.040]   that told the history and the meaning
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.480]   of all kinds of names, and I thought,
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.240]   that's a wild thing to read aloud,
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:07.280]   but it gets your family reading together
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.240]   and talking together and thinking together,
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.360]   and so that's a great thing to read.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.920]   - I agree, we've even had Calvin and Hobbes
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.800]   and joke books that were fun.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.260]   I remember my kids have all gone through periods
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.920]   where they found the joke book pile
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.500]   and wanted to share those, which has been so fun.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:33.480]   I gained a whole vocabulary for construction vehicles
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.440]   and space exploration for myself.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.880]   - Yeah, I didn't think about that, yeah.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.840]   - I had no idea, I was like, what's that thing?
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.640]   And he would know, I mean, he would just pop up
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.820]   and I had to learn that vocabulary with him
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.360]   'cause he wanted to know what's that, what's that, what's that?
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.140]   - Isn't that great.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:53.280]   I think it's really one way that parents
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:58.280]   can chase the read together is find the hobby
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:02.000]   that your child is interested in, and like Brittany said,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.320]   find a manual of how to do that thing.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.720]   If your child is all of a sudden,
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.160]   is a Boy Scout interested in camping,
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.920]   then find some camping books or find some trail books,
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.440]   some trail descriptions, some camping or hiking books
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.500]   that you could read together and pursue,
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.520]   that's you pursuing your child's love,
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.800]   pursuing their passion, and you're gonna read together
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:33.580]   will give you ideas of things to talk about together.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.400]   - Let me ask you this, Brittany, 'cause you said
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.240]   you had some kids who like to read more than other kids,
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.640]   so I know that you've got some experience with this.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.560]   Is there hope for parents whose kids
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.500]   just do not like to read?
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.560]   - Yes, I think it's one of those areas
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.000]   that we have to take on faith
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.440]   and keep sowing those daily seeds and try to do things
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.200]   that make reading together pleasurable,
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.880]   like reading out loud in morning time,
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.760]   or we used to do, my kids were like,
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.240]   "Poetry, I don't wanna read poetry,"
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.580]   so we did Wednesdays, Tea and Poetry.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.320]   We would take a break from all of our studies
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.360]   and I would make it special, something to drink,
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.860]   it wasn't always tea 'cause they weren't into tea,
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.420]   some sort of snack we'd have together.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.880]   For my child who liked to bake,
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.440]   she would often bake something for us
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.940]   and we would have just a few minutes together,
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:34.000]   finding, remembering that you can read with your ears
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.940]   is important, there's great audiobooks
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.700]   and dramatized versions of stories
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.660]   that might get your child interested.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.900]   Reading outdoors, you don't have to read in a chair.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.980]   Reading in hammocks, one year when I noticed
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.580]   one of my struggling readers kind of was
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.040]   starting to take off, well, they love to be outdoors,
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.780]   so my husband put a hammock in our front yard.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.860]   Between the only two trees that were close enough
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.120]   to hold a hammock and they were constantly
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.660]   in that hammock reading and it became a thing of pleasure.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:12.520]   Inviting others in, I know our campus, our littles have,
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:17.240]   our young learners have had a book club of their own
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.520]   that moms have made really pleasurable.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.760]   But I think most of all, oh, and for little kids,
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:29.660]   I mean, some of my children haven't enjoyed sitting still,
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.820]   so giving them something to do with their hands
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:36.520]   and being really generous with the kinds of things
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.300]   that they would enjoy and just being,
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.120]   if it gets a little noisy, it's okay.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:44.180]   Just trust that they're listening anyway,
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.660]   even if they're actively moving.
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.580]   In fact, one of my kids needed to move
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.280]   in order to listen. - Yep, absolutely.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.140]   - I think the more you can just kind of encourage
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.320]   their natural event and just be patient,
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.280]   try to give them books so beautiful and so good
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.380]   that they'd wanna eat them.
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:03.540]   I think is what one publisher said about their books.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:07.020]   But that can be, it might just be that the child
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.700]   needs to grow and learn or come upon a subject
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.100]   they're hungry to learn about and they,
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.140]   because of your example, they know how to do it.
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.100]   So they might leap off on their own at some point
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.260]   and start using all the tools of learning
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.560]   to learn about that thing.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.900]   And that can be just so encouraging to us as parents
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:30.500]   to remember the days of, "Oh no, what have I done wrong?
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.660]   "My child doesn't like to read on their own yet."
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:37.060]   - Yes, oh, Brittany, you have been so encouraging.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:42.060]   All of those seem like such inspired suggestions,
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:45.540]   but they are also very hopeful.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.500]   They are, I love, love that you said,
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.700]   "Make it pleasurable and be regular."
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:55.220]   And then all the good ideas that you have offered
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.040]   our listeners, changing the venue and let them move
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.140]   and most of all, be patient, be patient
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.400]   and keep building the relationship.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.980]   I think some of the things that my girls remember the most
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.980]   about reading together is not what we read.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.760]   It was how it made us feel.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:23.260]   It was warm and we were together
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:27.920]   and they felt special and they had my full attention.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.780]   And we built, like you said earlier, a family culture,
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:39.700]   lots of inside jokes and lots of joint memories.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:44.920]   And that to me is one of the beauties of reading together.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:51.180]   Before I let you go, 'cause I always get good ideas from you
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.740]   and I've got my pen at the ready.
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:58.740]   Tell me what are three books that you are reading now?
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.420]   I know you're reading way more than three,
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.420]   so I'm just asking for three.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:08.820]   - Yeah, well, I try to read old books and new books
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.060]   'cause I remember C.S. Lewis said,
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.300]   "It's a good rule after reading a new book
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.100]   "to never allow yourself another new one
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.300]   "until you've read an old one in between."
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.280]   - Kinda like that too.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.300]   - Yeah, or if that's too much, read one.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.020]   He says read one, old one, to every three new ones.
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:28.240]   So an old book I'm reading is,
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.840]   it's called "The Annotated Alice."
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.820]   It's "Alice in Wonderland."
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.100]   And the second book, "Through the Looking Glass,"
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.980]   and it's beautifully illustrated
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.660]   and has all kinds of interesting footnotes.
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.040]   I've always been fascinated with her
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.140]   and my youngest loves "Alice in Wonderland" too.
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:48.560]   So "The Annotated Alice," the definitive edition,
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.380]   it's by Lewis Carroll and Martin Gardner,
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:56.380]   who's a Lewis Carroll expert, edited that.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.260]   So that's been fun, it's helped,
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.860]   it's been fun to figure out those mysteries
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.340]   that are in that book and the funny parts,
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.320]   the jokes that I don't get all the time.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:10.740]   I'm reading, I just finished "The Inklings"
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.300]   by Humphrey Carpenter.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.260]   It's about the, all the groups, the writers,
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.780]   C.S. Lewis and Tolkien and Charles Williams and others.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.580]   Yeah, and kind of their, how they were educated
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.520]   and how they grew up
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.760]   and then how they encouraged each other's work.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.780]   I just thought, what a good thing to learn about community
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.940]   and learning in communities.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.580]   That's been really helpful because they did,
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.460]   a lot of them receive a classical Christian education
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:39.660]   and we're trying to recover that.
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.640]   So that's been interesting.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.260]   I listened to it on audio book.
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.200]   That was good.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.580]   And then my last one has just been super fascinating.
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.020]   It's really short.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.540]   It's called "Lifting the Veil, Imagination
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.060]   and the Kingdom of God."
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.040]   And it's by Malcolm Guy.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.000]   He's a living poet, used to be a '70s rocker.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.080]   The Lord converted him through poetry
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.620]   in a similar way to C.S. Lewis.
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:06.700]   And he's just a wonderful gift to,
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:11.400]   I think, the Christian world and the academic world.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.940]   He's a sonnet writer, but he wrote this lovely,
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.660]   it's really small.
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.260]   It's called "Lifting the Veil, Imagination
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.100]   and the Kingdom of God."
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:22.100]   And that's just been encouraging to me to think about
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.460]   how the Lord gave us both reason and imagination
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.080]   and how they kind of have a Lord bridge those.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.540]   - Wow. - Himself.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.800]   - Yeah. - So those are three
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.540]   I'm reading right now.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:32.380]   - That is cool.
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:36.020]   And I like it that you and I have talked about this before,
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.560]   that we're hardly ever anymore
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.720]   just reading one book at a time.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.140]   I was saying to you earlier, Brittany,
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:48.080]   that I feel there are different parts of my personality.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.820]   And so I need to feed all those pieces of myself.
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:55.340]   And so it takes different kinds of books to do that.
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:00.100]   And so parents, listeners, we encourage you to read,
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.860]   to minister to yourself, to grow and to learn
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.800]   and to keep learning yourself
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.420]   so that you will not become a barren desert.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:14.020]   So don't read only to encourage your children,
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:18.740]   but read to embolden yourself as a lifelong learner
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:19.940]   and as a grower.
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:23.900]   And in that vein, Brittany, I want to ask you the question,
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:28.900]   what makes you an everyday educator?
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:35.140]   - I think because I'm a human being, we're learners.
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.140]   I'm a parent, soon to be a grandparent.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.660]   I'm an ambassador for classical Christian education renewal,
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:46.140]   a CC lover, an advocate, and I've learned that
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.420]   what we learn is meant to be shared.
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.980]   And so when we share it, we gain new friends,
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.620]   we get to see the world a new way,
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:57.060]   and we encourage others to do the same.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:01.340]   And that helps us all to know the Lord and to make Him known.
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.540]   - I love that, that is lovely.
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:07.360]   That's a great reason to be an everyday educator.
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:13.300]   If you listeners want to keep learning,
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.760]   to keep educating yourself as you educate your children,
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.780]   reading is a great way to do that.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:22.300]   And I know that Brittany has been a blessing to you today
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:26.700]   as you have thought about the whys of reading together
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:30.340]   and the what could we read and even how can I encourage
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.380]   my children to keep on reading.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:37.120]   Thank you, Brittany, this has been a great time together.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.960]   Listeners, I want to encourage you to look toward
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.920]   another great time that we could all have together.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.160]   This is gonna sound like I'm telling you something
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.820]   that is so far ahead, you're gonna wonder
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.440]   why I'm even mentioning it.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:59.260]   Our national events weekend for 2024 has already been set.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:04.840]   So you could mark your calendar now
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.500]   for the annual national events weekend on May 2nd
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:12.500]   through the 4th in Southern Pines, North Carolina.
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.900]   And why am I telling you about this now?
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:19.900]   Well, it is because registration is opening November 1st.
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:25.620]   So if you are interested in attending
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.340]   the national events weekend in Southern Pines,
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.460]   you can check that out
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:35.460]   at classicalconversationsfoundation.org.
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:40.160]   This is a conference that's put on
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.480]   by Classical Conversations Foundations.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.840]   It's a great time, families from all over the United States
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.600]   come and have three full days of events
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.240]   and learning about classical education,
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.540]   but also celebrating the hard work of students.
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:58.880]   Some of the things that happen at national event weekend
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.440]   include national conference
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.800]   where you get to hear lots of great speakers,
