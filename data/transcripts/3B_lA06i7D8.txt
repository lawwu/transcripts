[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   Hi, my name is Ray. I am a husband, father, and an animator at a video game studio, living
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.040]   just outside Raleigh, North Carolina. I've been a Desiring God ministry partner for five
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:21.640]   years. You're listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with John Piper.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.720]   That was Ray, a friend of ours who animates video games. He has an interesting story to
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.640]   share as you can imagine, and that's going to be up here in a moment. But first, Pastor
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.560]   John, we have talked a lot on this podcast about personal productivity, and that leads
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.320]   us to today's question from a listener named Paul, who lives in Suria, Spain. Paul writes
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.280]   this, "Hello, Pastor John. Thank you for this podcast. Way back in episode 839, you mentioned
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.560]   the importance of writing out a personal mission statement for our lives with the aim of enhancing
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.640]   personal productivity. I agree completely, and I find this task entirely daunting. So
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.800]   how do I, as an average Christian layperson, go about coming up with a personal mission
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.640]   statement? Should we be strengths and talents oriented about it? Should we focus on roles?
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.960]   Should we mostly focus on spiritual needs in the church, both locally and globally?
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.600]   And how do we avoid letting this statement grow so broad that we get overwhelmed to the
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.560]   point that such a statement does nothing actually to help us focus our energies? Any help would
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.560]   be appreciated."
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:34.280]   When I read the Bible, I cannot escape the relentless teaching that God has purposes.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.800]   He has goals in everything he does. He's not a God who is coasting aimlessly. He's not
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:49.240]   going in circles. The God of the Bible is pervasively pursuing accomplishments of his
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.980]   own counsel. So Isaiah 46, "I am God. There is no one like me, declaring, 'My counsel
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.240]   shall stand. I will accomplish all my purpose.'" So there it is. "I will accomplish all my
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:11.480]   purpose." God has purposes. He has plans. Isaiah 14, 24, "As I have planned, so shall
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.640]   it be. As I have purposed, so shall it stand." Plans, purposes. "I determined it long ago."
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.920]   Isaiah 37, 6, "I planned it from days of old, and I now bring it to pass." I don't
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.160]   think there would be any gospel, any salvation, any eternal joy if God were not a planner,
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.680]   one who lived with purposes and goals, because Acts 4.27 says that all the enemies of God
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.160]   were gathered together in Jerusalem at the crucifixion of Jesus to do whatever your hand,
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.560]   O God, your plan had predestined to take place. Now, when I step back from all of that vision
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:05.600]   of the planning, purposing God, the effect it has on me is to stir me up to really serious
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.060]   questions, like, "Well, what is God's ultimate goal then?" I'm sure he has millions
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.680]   of sub-goals and sub-purposes in everything he does. I like to say, "God's doing 10,000
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.080]   things we don't know anything about." Most of those goals and purposes are hidden from
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:34.320]   us, but what has he revealed as his main or his ultimate purpose? Where's everything
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.760]   going? That's the question that has burned in me ever since I was 22 years old and became
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:52.720]   a lover of the all-ordaining, all-planning God. And then the next question becomes, "Well,
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:00.080]   if I could discern what his ultimate goal was, how can I join him in it? I want to fit
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.840]   in to his ultimate purpose. I don't want to strive against it. I want to be right in
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:14.040]   sync with what God is pursuing in the world. Nothing seems more obviously reasonable to
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:24.040]   me or hopeful to me than that God's creatures should gladly fit into his purposes." So
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.440]   surely that's his call on us. That's what he's beckoning us to do. "Find my purpose.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.760]   Join me in it." So that's my second question then. Is there a way I can join the purpose
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.440]   of God once I have found out what his ultimate purpose is? And then the question becomes,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:54.040]   how do I do everything I am doing so that I help that ultimate goal come about or so
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.560]   that I can be used by God to make it come about? I want everything, not just a few things,
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:10.200]   but everything I do to somehow contribute to that purpose. So that's why mission statements
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:18.240]   seem helpful to me. They keep me focused on the great things of life. But let me caution
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:27.680]   us here. I think the particularities of life are too variable for our mission statement
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:36.280]   to be very detailed. I know our friend asked that it not be too general, and yet I might
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.440]   disappoint him because I find big, big general purposes really helpful if they're the right
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:48.760]   kind. So the more particularities about yourself and about your circumstances that you include,
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.080]   the more short-term your statement's going to be because so much changes, right? You
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.840]   change, your job changes, you have kids, you get sick, you move. Oh my goodness, life is
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:08.040]   just so variable that if you make your mission statement to include things about yourself,
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.160]   things about your circumstances that are going to change relatively quickly, then you're
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   going to have to be changing your mission statement all the time, and that's probably
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.200]   not very helpful. So if you want your mission statement to last more than a few years, it
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:30.680]   will need to be high-level and general, and that's mainly what I have in mind when I think
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:38.560]   of my own statements that guide my life. I need to be reminded regularly about the big
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:46.440]   picture of life. What's everything about? What goals can I have that are in sync with
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:55.520]   God's goals and are so clearly biblical that they don't change? So let me give you a whirlwind
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:02.400]   process of arriving at such a statement, and then you can adapt it to your situation. In
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:11.560]   those crucial years of discovery for me, life-changing years, 22 to 25, what I saw and could not
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:21.400]   deny and have never changed my mind on since was that God was infinitely full of every
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:29.760]   perfection and could not be improved and was the sum of all excellence, all beauty, all
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:37.440]   worth, all greatness, so that his purpose never included people counseling him or adding
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:44.240]   to him or improving him or providing for his needs since he doesn't have any. Rather,
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:52.200]   what I saw was that God was the kind of God whose ultimate aim was that his fullness,
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:59.320]   his completeness, his perfection would overflow with the communication of all his satisfying
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:05.880]   greatness and beauty and worth and excellence to me. In other words, God's ultimate purpose
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:12.880]   is to be seen and savored and shown. Those are my three favorite words for describing
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:21.040]   it. God's ultimate purpose is to be seen and savored and shown as infinitely glorious.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:28.960]   That's his ultimate purpose. This is not megalomania, by the way, because the communication of himself
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:36.240]   in all his glory is what the human soul was made to be satisfied by. So God is the one
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:44.800]   being in all the universe, and he's the only one for whom self-communication and self-exaltation
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:52.200]   is the highest virtue and the most loving act. So Isaiah 43, 6, "Bring my sons from
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:09:00.320]   afar, my daughters from the ends of the earth, everyone who is called by my name, whom I
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:09.160]   created for my glory." And so the very first thing that he teaches us to pray over and
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:16.760]   over is, "Hallowed be your name," that is, glorified, treasured, loved, honored,
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:24.040]   praised, admired, enjoyed, hallowed be your name. That's the first and foremost cry
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:34.040]   of every saint every day. "Make me a means, God, please make me a means of the communication
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:39.520]   and the display of your beauty and your worth and your greatness." That is, "May others
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:47.120]   hallow your name because I exist." That's why we come into being. That's the essence
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:53.960]   of every biblical personal mission statement, I think, if it ties into God's ultimate
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.800]   purpose. So that's where I start. And then the question becomes, "How?" And the
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.480]   Bible seems—that is, "How can I live that way? How can I join in to that accomplishment
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:10.360]   of that purpose?" And the Bible just seems to offer countless answers, like, "Whether
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.440]   you eat or drink, do all to the glory of God. Give thanks to the glory of God. Confess
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:21.640]   Jesus to the glory of God. Do good deeds that God may be glorified. Welcome one another
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.640]   to the glory of God. Be generous to the poor for the glory of God," and on and on. I
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:32.920]   have other texts listed here, but they're all over the place. Everything we should be
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:40.840]   doing with our bodies and our minds and our hearts should be something that makes God
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:47.880]   look glorious, because he really is. We're helping people see him, savor him, show him
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:56.080]   for what he's really like. So finally, the question becomes, "Is there a common denominator
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:02.880]   that runs through all of those deeds, all those attitudes, all those words, that turn
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:11.720]   them into God-glorifying acts? How does everything I do become worship? How does everything I
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:18.880]   do become a display of God's greatness and beauty and worth?" And the answer is given,
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:26.640]   for example, there are other places, 1 Peter 4.11, "Let the one who serves serve in the
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:34.400]   strength that God supplies so that in everything God may be glorified." So if everything
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:43.080]   you do is a service, then he says, "Let the service be by relying on the all-sufficiency
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.920]   of God's grace in your life so that when you accomplish what you just attempted to
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:53.280]   do, it's done in his strength so that he gets the glory." You get the enablement
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.740]   and the power and the guidance and the strength, and he gets the glory. So when we joyfully
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:08.120]   rely on God in all that we do in the service of others, God looks glorious in our lives.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:15.600]   Same thing in 2 Thessalonians 1.11, "Let every work be a 'work of faith by God's
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:23.800]   power so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you.'" That's 2 Thessalonians
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:33.480]   1.11 and 12. Same point as 1 Peter 4. We do what we do in glad reliance upon God for everything
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:40.640]   we need in order to love people. In other words, we live by faith in the promises of
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:49.520]   God in the service of love. So I would say, build your life mission statement by thinking
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:58.960]   through this much before you get to the details of your own gifting and your own calling.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:05.240]   God is infinitely glorious. God means to communicate that glory to his people, to see it, savor
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:11.040]   it, show it. He means for us to join him in that purpose. That applies to absolutely everything
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:17.280]   we do, and we do it in humble reliance upon his grace and power, which come through Jesus
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.600]   Christ in the service of others. That will make him look great.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:28.520]   Then, when you have crafted an overarching mission statement built on those purposes
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:35.560]   of God, then you can make some short-term mission statements. Say for a year, you're
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.320]   going to write a book, or you're going to change jobs, or you're going to pursue marriage,
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:48.800]   or whatever. Some short-term that then draws particularities up into that mission statement
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.240]   according to the season of your life.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.400]   Thank you, Pastor John. That's helpful at the macro level and in the fine details of
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.240]   life as well. That's a great question, Paul. Thank you.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.640]   Speaking of personal productivity, before we go, right now on the phone is Ray, a productive
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:10.160]   video game animator who lives in North Carolina. You heard his voice at the top of this episode
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.720]   because Ray is a friend of ours and a ministry partner, someone who makes this podcast possible.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:21.440]   Ray, I'm thankful for you and for your time. Can you tell us a little about yourself? You
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.560]   got to tell us the story of how you found your way into the gaming industry.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:30.440]   Sure. My wife and I grew up in a small town in East Tennessee. We met in high school and
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:35.720]   dated and been together since. I always had an interest in art and technology as a kid.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:41.640]   I originally wanted to be a comic book artist, but then really got into computer-aided drafting
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:48.240]   in high school. Eventually, I became a computer animator. I've worked in visual effects for
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:54.000]   film for several years and have been working in the gaming industry for the past, I guess,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.480]   dozen or so years. We live in North Carolina and have two wonderful children, an eight-year-old
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.280]   daughter and a two-year-old son.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:07.400]   Yeah. Years ago, you met John Piper, so to speak, while working on movies in Hollywood.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.460]   What was your introduction to John Piper content?
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:16.020]   My first animation job was with a visual effects company in Los Angeles. I was living and working
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:21.160]   a nine-to-five job in Tennessee and then got a call out of the blue that my work had been
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.320]   seen online and I was offered a contract. Just picked up everything, drove across the
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:34.760]   country, moved to Los Angeles and found myself a very long way from home, not just geographically,
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.320]   but culturally and relationally. I had a friend of a friend who lived about an hour away from
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.600]   LA and that was the only person I knew in California.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.600]   Wow.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:48.580]   I found myself in this strange situation and I'm in front of a computer with headphones
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:54.860]   on for like 12, 14 hours a day. The hours were just grueling at first. It dawned on
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:59.180]   me that I'm sitting here listening to music at a time it was Pandora. I don't even know
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:04.460]   if that's still around. I'd listen to Pandora for like 12 hours a day. It's like I could
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:11.420]   be filling my ears and mind with something much better than this. That started this process
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:16.560]   where I eventually stumbled across some of John Piper's sermons online. And then ever
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.680]   since I've just been a voracious consumer of Desiring God's content from the podcast,
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:27.620]   the articles, the YouTube videos, all have just been such a blessing to me and my family.
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:32.960]   So encouraging. Looking back over the years, how would you summarize the effects of Desiring
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.520]   God resources on your life?
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:41.020]   Yeah, looking back, I think there's been like two kind of main impacts that Desiring
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:47.000]   God has had and continues to have really. The first one, I've been shown again and again
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.320]   that my view of God is too small, that my outlook into the world is so self-centered
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:17:03.200]   and my appreciation for His sovereignty and His gifts is so superficial and based on my
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:09.400]   circumstances so often, so short-sighted. And the second major impact is that God's
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:15.880]   Word is deeper and richer and more beautiful and deserves so much more of my focus and
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:21.160]   time and attention than I've given it. And those two things have impacted pretty much
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.400]   every part of my life and the life of our family.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.240]   Powerful, powerful. Thank you very—so you're talking to a bunch of listeners to the podcast
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.640]   right now, many who have never given in the past. What would you say to them in this opportunity
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:39.040]   for them to join you as a ministry partner with us at Desiring God?
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:44.560]   So in my personal devotion yesterday, I was in Psalm 102 and came across this and it just
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:50.560]   stood out to me so much. So I'll share that. And it's verse 18, I think. "Let this be recorded
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:55.840]   for a generation to come, so that a people yet to be created may praise the Lord." And
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.880]   it goes on to talk about how God looks down, heard the groans of the prisoners, He freed
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:06.160]   them. But to me, that sums up why we support Desiring God. We want to contribute in any
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:12.880]   small way that we can so that the God-glorifying message that Desiring God consistently puts
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.720]   out can be recorded for a generation to come so that people yet to be created may praise
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:24.840]   the Lord. Our prayer is that people all over the world now and in the future will hear
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.640]   the message and be as blessed and uplifted and as drawn to their Bibles and to their
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:35.880]   needs as we have been by it. And I just feel like how could we not try to support that
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:41.800]   in any way that we possibly can? And if anyone needs proof that that is happening, you can
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.840]   just glance at the YouTube comments on pretty much anything on Desiring God's channel and
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:52.200]   you see messages from people saying, "I desperately needed this. I've been in a dark place." It's
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.360]   like, how can we read those things from our brothers and sisters and not feel like this
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.200]   is absolutely worthy of any support that we can give it?
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.520]   Amazing. Yeah. And YouTube is our fastest growing channel for this podcast. A shout
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:11.440]   out to those of you who are listening right now to APJ on YouTube. Five years of partnering
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.440]   with us, Ray. Thank you so much for your role in supporting everything that we do at Desiring
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.560]   God, this podcast, the website, and of course, our YouTube channel. We appreciate it.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.360]   Thank you all. It's been an honor. And we just thank you so much for the message that
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.880]   you put out, the charity and winsomeness and spirit that it always carries. It's been such
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:37.040]   a blessing to me and my family. Sobering and encouraging. Near the end of the
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.640]   year, it's a great reminder that we have generous friends all over the U.S. and all over the
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:45.840]   world who support this ministry, friends who have profited from Desiring God personally
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.920]   over the years, and then who eventually became partners with us to get behind a ministry
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:56.160]   well-positioned to serve a generation to come so that a people yet to be created may praise
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:01.760]   the Lord. That is an awesome perspective. And if you have found this ministry helpful,
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:07.280]   our articles, books, sermons, videos, podcasts, and if you want to help make all of those
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.640]   resources available for the world now and into the future, all free of charge, consider
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.120]   becoming a monthly ministry partner. Much of our financial support comes from folks
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:25.840]   who give on average $30 a month. To set up monthly giving, go to give.desiringgod.org.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:32.640]   That's give.desiringgod.org. Much appreciated. I'm your host, Tony Ranke,
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.760]   and Pastor John and I return on Monday. We'll see you then.
