[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   An aspiring pastor writes in to ask, "Pastor John, what would you look for in deciding on a seminary?"
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Don't look for a building, don't look for a campus, don't look for a library, don't look for a location.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Look for a faculty. That's my advice.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   And then if you ask me, "Okay, if I'm looking for a faculty, what am I looking for?"
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   I would say, "Look for a faculty who reveres the Bible as God's inerrant word."
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Which may be easier to sniff out than whether they love God.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Loving God is a little more personal and abstract, but you can begin to detect in the way a person teaches and writes
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   as to whether their relationship with the Bible is one of amazing, deep, controlling reverence for God's inerrant word.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   So look for that.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Number two, look for rigor in their exegetical labors.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   That they are drawing out truth from the Word more than they are drawing out truth from systems.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And from books.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   When you go to their classes, or when you read their books, or when you talk to students about them,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   are they biblically saturated?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Are they bent on proving their points not by saying, "Luther said it," or "Wesley said it," or "Calvin said it,"
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   but "Paul said it," and "Jesus said it," and "Here's the verse," and "Here's the logic of the verse," and "That's why we stand on it."
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Are they that kind of Bible people rather than system people?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Third, look for a solid, coherent, biblical theology with the gospel at the center and the sovereignty of God underneath
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   and the glory of God at the top.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Look for a God-centered, gospel-permeated theology with the glory of God and the sovereignty of God very prominent.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And fourth, look for people, look for faculty who feel and believe in the lostness of human beings
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   and the uniqueness of Christ as their only hope of salvation.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Men who weep that people are going to hell.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   They believe in hell.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   They think people are going there without Jesus.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And Jesus is the stunningly all-sufficient, all-satisfying, unique and only way of salvation
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   so that there's an urgency about what they teach.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And fifth, look for a love for the church.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Look for a passion to be connected with the church.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Not loners off doing their own academic thing, but they're part of the church.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   They love the church. They want to feed the church and provide leaders for the church.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And to that end, I mean, those kinds of faculty, visit classes, talk to students, correspond with faculty,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   do what you need to do to find out what kinds of people are going to be teaching you.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   That's my way of doing it.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
