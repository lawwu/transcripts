[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.120]   - We're back with Tim Keller, author of the book
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.680]   titled Every Good Endeavor,
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.660]   Connecting Your Work to God's Work.
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.760]   We talked yesterday on the important topics
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.160]   of business vocation and calling.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.960]   Along the way we talked to college graduates
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.880]   and we talked to parents, we talked to Christians
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.300]   who feel stuck, stuck in their jobs.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.440]   Let's move forward and discuss a young man
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.240]   or a young woman who is deciding on a career now.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.460]   I mean, one of the things you say in the book
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.160]   is that in New York City, a number of sharp young adults
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.640]   graduate from college and then they select a career
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.960]   as a form of identity.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.700]   The career becomes for them a status symbol.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.800]   Explain that.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.240]   - Well, there's been a lot of great books written recently
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.080]   on this idea that we live in a consumeristic age
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.860]   in which your identity is seen in the products you consume.
[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.920]   I'm the kind of person that wears this kind of clothing,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.020]   owns this kind of, these electronics,
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.620]   I, you know, these are the accessories I use.
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.900]   So you actually get your identity
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.460]   from the brands that you use.
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.380]   And I'm afraid that what's happened here
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.500]   is that jobs are like that too.
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.220]   And there's just no doubt, I see plenty of people
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.380]   taking jobs that really don't fit,
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.540]   A, it doesn't fit their talents very well,
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.820]   and B, very often the jobs don't necessarily fulfill them
[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.340]   because the jobs aren't really maybe helping people
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.860]   very much, but the jobs are high status.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.460]   And because they're high status,
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.960]   people feel like I need to be in that job
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.340]   so I can feel good about myself, so it's an identity marker.
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.500]   So people are very often not choosing jobs
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.860]   on the basis of vocation, not saying what gifts do I have
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.140]   and how can I be useful to other people through my work,
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.460]   but how do I take a job that gives me
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.740]   the same kind of sense of self-worth I get
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.900]   when I'm driving a particular kind of car.
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.940]   - Yeah, fascinating.
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.980]   All right, here's a hypothetical question,
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.060]   but I think it gets a modern business ethics question
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.260]   that we get a lot in the inbox.
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.460]   Let's pretend in ancient Babylon,
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.780]   there's a God-fearing man who grows straw.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.260]   He's good at it, he works hard, he serves his buyer well,
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.100]   he always delivers his straw on time,
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.980]   he's joyful, humble, people like him.
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.260]   But his straw is then used to create reinforced,
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.100]   baked bricks that are stacked one on top of each other
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.060]   into the Tower of Babel.
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.540]   I mean, the question is this, at one point,
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.580]   is the straw grower's vocation virtuous or not virtuous?
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.940]   Or to put this in other terms,
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.460]   how far is the Christian accountable
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.380]   to the ultimate ends of company that he or she works for,
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.240]   which may exist only to create a name for itself?
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.500]   - Well, I mean, I think you have to be very directly
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.820]   collaborating with evil before you start to try to get that.
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.940]   See, the trouble with the purest impulse is this.
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.180]   If I make bread and I know that there are criminals
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.140]   in town eating that bread and staying alive
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.660]   because of my bread making, should I really get out of that?
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.300]   Should I say, okay, well, only a certain percentage
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.260]   of the criminal, but I mean, I'm helping them live.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.260]   I mean, you actually, Luther would laugh at the idea
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.060]   that you, in some pure way, have to make sure
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.780]   that your work only furthers godly ends.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.920]   He says, your job is there to,
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.660]   God feeds everything that has breath.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.940]   Luther expounds the Psalms, especially Psalms 145
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.940]   and 146 and 147, where it talks about God feeds everything
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.340]   that has breath.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.140]   He loves everything that he's made.
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.280]   And Luther then says, okay, well,
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.620]   how does God feed everybody?
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.860]   Well, he feeds them through the farmer.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.460]   He feeds them through the milkmaid,
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.420]   who's milking the cow.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.500]   He feeds it through the truck driver
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.380]   who's bringing the things to market.
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.820]   That's really God's work then.
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.940]   If you're just farming, you're doing God's work.
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.020]   It doesn't have to be a Christian farmer.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.420]   You just do it, and it's God's work.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.060]   But then at a certain point,
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.700]   I do believe, 'cause I'm Reformed,
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.580]   and I believe in world view, importance of world view,
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.740]   that work also does need to have,
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.740]   it has to be done from a Christian perspective.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.460]   But I also think that Luther's got something to say,
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.660]   that all work is good work if it's done well.
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.540]   And that if you actually try to say,
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.780]   well, this work is actually helping someone
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.620]   who's furthering evil ends, at a certain point,
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.060]   you'd be completely paralyzed.
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.300]   You couldn't do anything.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.020]   - Yeah, that's really good.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.980]   One final question, Tim, and then I'll let you go.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.700]   What would you say to a Christian
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.460]   who does not have a lot of options?
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.460]   They have a job that was available,
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.960]   not because they chose it from 12 different options.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.900]   Speak to a Christian who is,
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.940]   or who feels like they are vocationally stuck.
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.460]   How does the doctrine of vocation work in their situation?
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.940]   - So Luther's understanding of calling
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.340]   is that the farm girl who's milking the cows
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.780]   needs to, even if it's the only job available to her
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.820]   and she'd like to go somewhere else,
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.860]   she needs to see what she's doing is God's calling.
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.020]   She needs to say that this isn't just milking cows,
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.220]   this is my way of participating in God's care for creation.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.220]   Because he has decided this is how I'm going to do it.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.100]   There's a place where Luther takes,
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.260]   I forget what psalm, where he says,
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.860]   "God strengthens the bars of the city gates."
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.240]   In other words, he gives you security.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.080]   And then Luther says,
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.660]   "But how does God strengthen the bar of your city gates?"
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.300]   He does it with good governors
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.480]   and good policemen and good soldiers.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.140]   And what he's trying to get across
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.140]   is that all good work done well is God's calling.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.740]   And that aspect, see,
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.860]   I actually do think that the Calvinist understanding
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.260]   of calling, which is doing God's work
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.840]   from a Christian worldview,
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.080]   and the Lutheran understanding of calling,
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.740]   which is simply caring for creation,
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.340]   being useful to other people through the work you do,
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.780]   I do think they're complementary.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.460]   I really do.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.460]   And I think it's something of a,
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.300]   that's a very big part of the book,
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.600]   is to bring out the fact that I think they're complementary.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.000]   You've got to use them both.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.200]   So seeing your work as a calling is not a problem
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.360]   if you're stuck in a job you don't like.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.460]   You need to say that right now, it's still God's calling.
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.260]   And that gives me,
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.220]   I think that gives you a lot of peace to say,
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.220]   "Hey, I can still answer God's calling in this job,
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.580]   even when I am looking for a job
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.580]   that I think fits my gifts better."
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.500]   - Yeah, thank you.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.660]   That was Timothy Keller from his office in New York City.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.940]   Keller serves as the pastor
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.580]   of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.660]   And he is the author of a wheelbarrow full of great books,
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.900]   including "Every Good Endeavor,
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.700]   Connecting Your Work to God's Work."
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.820]   Check it out.
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.300]   This week's episodes were pulled
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.580]   from my 2012 interview with him.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.300]   While atheism is not an ignorance problem,
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.580]   atheism is a preference problem.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.360]   And John Piper will explain the difference tomorrow.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.200]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.700]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.280]   (upbeat music)
