[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor John Piper.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.960]   Pastor John, here's the next question on the list. It's a heavy one,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.720]   and it's an email from an anonymous man. "Pastor John, did God cause or would God cause my wife
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.120]   to miscarry our child because I have a struggle with lust and pornography? I have a lot of guilt
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.920]   right now, and I don't know how to think about God's discipline and punishment for my sin. I'm
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:34.960]   very confused. Please help me." Wow. I see four issues, at least, in this question. One,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.040]   what does it mean to struggle with pornography? Two, does God discipline His children for their
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:50.000]   sin? Three, may that discipline come in the form of harm or even death to others that you love
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.640]   as well as yourself? Four, what should you do if you believe God has dealt you such a blow?
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:07.040]   Let's take those one at a time. One, I don't know what our friend, unnamed,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:17.760]   means by struggle, struggles with pornography. It might mean daily bondage of joining sinners
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.240]   on the screen in their wickedness by supporting them with our interest and our attention and our
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.280]   pleasure and then feeling guilty about it when we're done every day. I don't think that's much
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:40.880]   of a struggle. Calling it a struggle is a little less damning than what is really is, namely
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:51.280]   capitulation and participation. Or he might mean that he conquers the temptation 99 times out of
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.600]   100 and in a moment of weakness gives in but quickly turns away and repents. That may be
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.040]   what struggle means. That'd be a little more meaningful to call the word struggle. Whatever
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.320]   he means, I'm glad he calls it sin, which he does, because Jesus takes this sin so seriously,
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:24.640]   he uses a horrible picture to describe the warfare against it and the worst possible warning
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:33.600]   against failure in the war. Here's what he says, Matthew 5 29, "If your right eye causes you to sin,"
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.280]   he's talking about lust, "tear it out and throw it away." Well, what? With a screwdriver?
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:53.360]   This is gross. This is horrible. What, your fingernails? "For it is better that you lose one
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:02.960]   of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell." So tearing out the eyeball
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.840]   is the most horrible description of the nature of the warfare, and hell is the most horrible
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:20.320]   warning of failure in the warfare, so I doubt that any of us has ever overestimated the danger
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   of failing to fight lust, and I'm glad that our anonymous questioner has called it sin and
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:37.680]   is feeling bad about it. Number two, does God discipline his children for their sin? Yes,
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:47.120]   he does. This is described perhaps most fully in Hebrews 12, even speaks of bloodshed if necessary,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.720]   that's the price we might pay for our sin. "Have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.160]   as sons? 'My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.960]   by him, for the Lord disciplines the one whom he loves and chastises every son whom he receives.'"
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.920]   Never feels that way, but we need to believe that because the Bible says so, God says so,
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.680]   and it's very important to remember that this book of Hebrews 12 is the same book that in
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:28.960]   chapter 10 verse 14 says, "By a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:38.320]   sanctified." That means in the warfare. Perfected. In other words, God can view his children both as
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:48.640]   perfected by Christ and still in need of perfecting in this life, and we should take tremendous heart
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:57.840]   from his painful perfecting work as evidence that we are perfected. Or we can add with trembling,
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:06.720]   he may see us in need of such protection from temptation that he takes our life.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:16.480]   That's what it says in 1 Corinthians 11 29, "Anyone who eats and drinks the Lord's supper
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.720]   without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself,
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:29.840]   that is why many of you are weak and ill and some have died." Falling asleep means died.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:37.200]   "But when we are judged by the Lord," that is put to death, "we're disciplined so that we may not be
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:46.160]   condemned along with the world." That's breathtaking. In other words, death, the death of a saint,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:53.200]   the death of one who is perfected, the death of one whom he loves, the death is the discipline
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:01.360]   of deliverance from condemnation. God takes him out so that he will not be taken out
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:10.560]   by the devil and by sin and go to hell. So yes, the Lord disciplines and his ways are not to be
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:19.040]   trifled with or made little of. Number three, may that discipline come in the form of harm,
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:28.240]   even death, to others that we love as well as ourselves? And the answer is yes, it may.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.840]   This was certainly the case with David's sin of adultery and murder with Bathsheba and her
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:45.440]   husband. Nathan the prophet said to David, "Even though the Lord," he says, "The Lord has put away
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:56.720]   your sin," and then the next thing, "Yet because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord,"
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:03.520]   and surely that is what pornography is, "the child who is born to you shall die."
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:14.400]   So I would certainly say in my own life, now hear this carefully, I would certainly say in my own
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:23.680]   life the most painful and humbling disciplining from the Lord has regularly been through the pain
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:30.560]   and suffering and sometimes death of those I love, rather than through any blows against my own body.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:39.200]   Oh, that we only suffered in our own body. This has been the way the deepest Christians have
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.960]   always thought about the losses through the death of those they love. Jonathan Edwards preached
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:55.200]   numerous sermons about the way the Lord disciplines a church by taking away a godly pastor in death.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:06.080]   Edwards' godly wife, Sarah, spoke about kissing the rod of God in the death of her 54-year-old
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:14.800]   husband, a rod of discipline that she felt more than anyone. She called it a rod of God on her
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   back, and she kissed it. Every loss that we endure as sinful children of God have two designs,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:33.440]   one from Satan, one from God. Satan designs our unbelief and rebellion and renunciation
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:43.360]   and guilt and paralysis and loss of faith. God designs our purification, and that we would hope
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:52.800]   less in this world and more in God who raises the dead. I don't know whether our friend who
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:09:04.880]   wrote this question lost his child in miscarriage as a direct discipline from God because of his
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:14.640]   pornography. I do not know. He does not know. I do know that in the loss of the child, God wills
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:21.280]   a new humility and a new submission and a new faith and new purity through the pain of this
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.840]   loss. So here's the fourth and final thing. What should you do? What should this person, this man,
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:41.520]   do if he believes that God has dealt him such a painful blow? And the answer is not in doubt.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:48.240]   Many things are in doubt. Many things are uncertain in this situation, but the path of
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:58.320]   gospel obedience is not uncertain. The glorious truth of the gospel is that we never need to be
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.560]   sure whether a specific suffering is owing to a specific disobedience. You don't need to know this.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.000]   You don't need to figure this out. I've dealt with so many people over the years who come into
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.280]   my office longing to know whether there's some connection between some pain and some sin,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:24.720]   and I always start and end with the fact you don't need to know that. And the reason we don't need to
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:31.360]   be sure about that is that the gospel forgiveness and gospel righteousness imputed through faith in
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:39.280]   Christ does not depend on that certainty of understanding. It depends on Christ and on
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:47.200]   faith in him. We don't need to be sure about the connection between our particular sufferings and
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:54.160]   our particular sins in this life because the death of Christ is sufficient to forgive the worst
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:05.040]   sin in spite of the worst suffering. That's the glory of the gospel. So what our friend must do
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:13.040]   in this confusion—he says, "I'm confused." Okay, so I'm saying what he must do in his confusion
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:20.400]   is stop fretting about whether his pornography was the direct cause of his miscarriage. He should
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:27.920]   stop fretting about that. He will never know for sure the answer to that question short of some
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:39.120]   direct revelation. Whether he knew it was or wasn't, the lesson remains the same. The Lord gives,
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:51.840]   and the Lord has taken away, and God's merciful design for our friend is that he worship—blessed
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:12:00.720]   be the Lord—worship more deeply the way Job did, and that he renounce sin more fully the way Job
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:09.200]   did, and that he lay afresh on the power of the Holy Spirit to flee all temptation, and that he
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:17.040]   renounce in the presence of his wife for her joy, and he's done with this sin.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.480]   That's a very helpful survey of a lot of intertwined issues in a sobering situation.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.760]   Thank you, Pastor John, for your willingness to tackle this question and the many questions that

[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:50.480]   know, "How is it that Jesus is my advocate in heaven right now if his work on earth was
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:56.080]   completely finished?" How do we wrestle with these two seeming contradictions? That's on Wednesday.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.480]   I'm your host, Tony Renke. We'll see you then on the Ask Pastor John podcast with long-time author
