[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.240]   - We're honored to be joined again by author
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.280]   and speaker Paul Tripp on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.320]   He is the author of the book Sex and Money.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.720]   And in the book, generally speaking, you write this,
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.400]   quote, "Life on this side of eternity
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.320]   "really is one big unceasing glory battle," end quote.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.520]   Explain that, that whole perspective of life for us.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.040]   What is glory and what is this cosmic glory battle
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.100]   that we find ourselves in the midst of?
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.120]   - Well, the first thing I wanna say about this
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.860]   is you have to talk about the way we were created.
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.760]   Human beings are hardwired by God for glory,
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.760]   for awe, to have our minds blown, our hearts expanded,
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.640]   to be taken beyond the normal, the mundane,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.760]   to be absorbed into what is wonderful
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.760]   and beautiful and satisfying.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.120]   Now, you see that in human beings.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.800]   That's why we like the triple overtime NBA game
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.320]   or the seven layer mousse cake
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.640]   or the movie that just keeps us on the edge of our seat.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.640]   Those are our created sort of glories.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.400]   Animals are not like that.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.320]   The penguins don't score one another
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.800]   as they jump off the ice.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.200]   You know, 9.5 technical merit
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.060]   but lacked artistic creativity.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.120]   The rhinoceros doesn't say to the zebra,
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.360]   "Dude, where'd you get that coat?
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.880]   "I mean, it's awesome.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.240]   "Look at the stripes."
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.180]   You just don't have that, but human beings do that.
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.280]   Now, the glory, that hardwiring,
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.620]   that glory hardwiring was meant to drive us to God,
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.760]   to find our satisfaction in God, in his glory,
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.760]   and our absorption by grace into things that are glorious.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.080]   Here's the problem.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.780]   We tend to replace the glory of the creator
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.620]   with the glory of the creation.
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.240]   I tend to get satisfied with created glory,
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.500]   and I tend to begin to believe
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.020]   that my heart can be satisfied by created glory.
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.180]   Here's the role of created glory.
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.180]   Created glory is one big finger
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.080]   to point me to the glory
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.220]   that will only ever satisfy my heart.
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.420]   Earth will never satisfy me.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.060]   Earth will never be my savior.
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.020]   It will never calm my heart.
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.260]   It will never give my heart peace or life or hope
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.020]   or meaning or satisfaction or contentment.
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.160]   And so as long as there's sin inside of me,
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.200]   there will be that war
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.600]   for what kind of glory will rule my heart.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.400]   Will my heart be ruled and my life be shaped
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.680]   by an anxious pursuit of created glory,
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.680]   or will my heart find its rest in the glory of God?
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.840]   - So let's take this down to the pavement.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.360]   How do you make this point concrete?
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.000]   - Well, here's the easiest one.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.880]   Food, food's glorious.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.600]   I mean, I will confess,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.840]   I am thankful for how much of the glory of God
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.200]   in creation is edible.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.320]   That's a wonderful thing.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.880]   But food is not supposed to rule my heart.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.960]   And it's amazing in Western culture,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.480]   medical people say that the number one health issue
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.480]   in America is what?
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.780]   Obesity.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.780]   Now that means that that glory of edible flora and fauna,
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.920]   fauna that God created means too much to us,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.920]   rules us too much, satisfies us too much.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.480]   And so we're actually chewing our way to our death.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.120]   Food, something as mundane as food is killing us
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.720]   because that glory rules us more than the glory of God.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.800]   Now, who can't relate to that?
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.400]   We all have gluttonous patterns in our life
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.220]   because that thing is in a place it was never meant to be.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.960]   - Thank you, Paul.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.480]   Paul Tripp, author of the book "Sex and Money,"
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.040]   a really helpful book worth checking out.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.680]   And you can get everything you wanna know
