[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   How does nitric oxide play into this?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:12.700]   This is a miraculous molecule that helps kill bacteria, helps kill viruses, is a vasodilator, so it opens up blood vessels.
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.400]   The way that erectile dysfunction drugs work, how do they work?
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.200]   They work by allowing your body to release more nitric oxide.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.000]   So we get six times more nitric oxide breathing in and out of our noses.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.300]   When I mentioned that thing about humming, when you hum, you get 15-fold increase of nitric oxide,
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.900]   which is why people who have chronic rhinitis, sinusitis, you feel a cold coming on, start humming immediately.
