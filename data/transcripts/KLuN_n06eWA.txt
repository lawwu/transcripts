[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   Based on the inbox, Pastor John, there are a lot of Christians listening to this podcast
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.080]   who did not expect to be single entering 2017.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.800]   Ashley, one of our listeners, is among them.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.880]   She writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, my struggle is singleness.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.640]   I'm 28, an elementary teacher, and that's not really a profession to meet single men.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.520]   I know that with the age of tender and hookups, casual sex will leave me empty inside, and
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.720]   it's not a lifestyle that I'm seeking.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.320]   At the same time, I feel alone as a Christian single.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.560]   I feel the church only sees me as serving material because I have "time to serve."
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.800]   In addition to the lack of men at church, I am an extrovert.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.920]   I do have a life outside of my singleness, and I try to live as if my singleness doesn't
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.240]   define me.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.520]   Everyone tells me I'm attractive, outgoing, and have a lot going for me.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.760]   Well, everyone but a Christian male, which is hard not to take personally.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.040]   How do I have hope in something uncertain?
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.420]   I'm not promised a life of marriage.
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.320]   How do I cling to the truth in a world lying to me about the satisfaction of hooking up?
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.360]   How do I not turn to the world when I feel like the church, Christian men, and even God
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.200]   himself seem to have no place for me?"
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.640]   Pastor John, what would you say to Ashley?
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.880]   Wow, there's so much there that we could talk about.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.840]   What's clear from the way Ashley asks her question, and I'm going to determine what
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.440]   I say here because of what I hear in the way she asked the question, what's clear is that
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:38.140]   she knows at one level the essence of the right answers to her own questions.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:46.760]   She asks with regard to a future husband, "How do I have hope in something uncertain?"
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.760]   And she answers, "I am not promised a life of a marriage."
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.240]   In other words, she knows we don't hope in uncertain things.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.920]   We don't put our hope in what we are not promised.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.320]   If we do, we're bound to be crushed.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:18.140]   We hope in things that are certain, not uncertain, things that God has promised, not things that
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:26.480]   we may rightly want but have not been promised and may receive or may not receive.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.400]   We hope in what is sure, what God has absolutely promised, and he watches over his word to
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.720]   perform it, and Ashley knows this.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:46.480]   And she asks, "How do I not turn to the world when I feel like the church, Christian men,
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.040]   and God have no place for me?"
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.880]   And she answers, "The world is lying to me about the satisfaction of hooking up."
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.700]   She knows it's a lie.
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.500]   She knows it's a lie.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.380]   Now my concern for Ashley, and many are like her and we're all like her from time to time,
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:21.740]   my concern for Ashley is that the lie is already starting to creep into the way she asks her
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.200]   questions.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:33.100]   This is exactly the way Satan insinuated his lie into Eve's mind in Genesis 3, and I don't
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.080]   want Ashley to become another Eve in the garden.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.380]   Here's what he said, or here's what God said.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.640]   Now the serpent was more crafty, subtle, than any other beast of the field that the Lord
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.180]   God had made.
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:01.480]   He said to the woman, "Did God actually say you shall not eat of any tree in the garden?"
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.300]   Now you see already what he's doing.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.780]   God only forbade one tree.
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:17.620]   Satan is insinuating the thought that God is stingy and forbade all the trees.
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:25.820]   Tragically, that seed of God's stinginess took root in Eve's mind, and you can see it
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.060]   immediately.
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.640]   The text goes on.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.540]   The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat, we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:43.460]   garden, but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree in the midst of the
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.420]   garden,'" and then she adds, "neither shall you touch it, lest you die."
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.260]   God did not say that.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.480]   God did not say, "You shall not touch this tree."
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.320]   But Eve was already feeling the lure of resentment against God.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.660]   God is withholding something from me in my life, and I don't like it.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.440]   He's a stingy God.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.520]   He's a narrow God.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.920]   He doesn't have my best interest at heart.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:31.320]   So when Ashley says, "I feel like the church, Christian men, and God have no place for me,"
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:40.560]   we may understand and empathize with the feeling, but alarm bells should be going off in her
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:50.140]   and our mind that the lie of Satan is taking root in the statement, "God has no place for
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.580]   me."
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:06:01.100]   So in answer to Ashley's question, "How can I not turn to the world?"
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:08.740]   Even though she knows the world is lying, my answer is, "Swim in the truth.
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:15.180]   Swim in the truth of God's Word and promise about you, Ashley.
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:21.100]   You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free from the lies of the world and
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.100]   the devil."
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.700]   That's what Jesus meant when he said that in John 8.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.100]   So let me point you, Ashley, to one truth.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.100]   We could do dozens.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.360]   One truth, big enough for you to swim in for a long time.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:41.380]   When Jesus was teaching about marriage, and he told his disciples, "There's no back door.
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:47.060]   Once you walk in, you are committed for better or for worse till death separates you.
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.380]   No back door."
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.660]   The disciples were stunned that Jesus shut the back door of marriage.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:01.100]   And they said, "If such is the case," this is Matthew 19.10, "If such is the case of
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.340]   a man with his wife, it's better not to marry."
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.140]   And then Jesus said something even more amazing.
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:14.220]   He said, "Not everyone is able to enter this relationship with such a high demand."
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.940]   And then he uses the word eunuch to describe different kinds of people who don't enter
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.940]   marriage.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:29.260]   Here's what he says, "Not everyone can receive this saying," this high expectation of marriage
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.460]   without a back door.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.020]   "Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given."
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.100]   In other words, only divine grace.
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:43.620]   Verse 12 of Matthew 19, "For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:50.780]   eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.540]   eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.500]   Let the one who is able to receive it, receive it."
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:08.140]   Now however literal we may take the word eunuch here, the implication is that there are various
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:14.020]   reasons why people are not called into marriage.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.140]   Some forgo it unwillingly, some willingly.
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:24.860]   What does the Bible have to say about God's grace toward them?
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.060]   What about their happiness and blessing?
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:36.100]   And the answer that God gives is found most beautifully in Isaiah 56.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:43.300]   He pictures two kinds of people who feel explicitly or especially excluded.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:50.820]   The foreigner, the Gentile who's not part of Israel, and the eunuch who feels fruitless
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.280]   and like there's no future for him because he has no family.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.100]   And here's what he says.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:05.700]   This is Isaiah 56 verse 3, "Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the Lord say, 'The
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.700]   Lord will surely separate me from his people.'
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:15.860]   And let not the eunuch say, 'Behold, I am a dry tree.'
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:22.040]   For thus says the Lord to the eunuchs who keep my Sabbath, who choose the things that
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:30.740]   please me and hold fast to my covenant, 'I will give in my house and within my walls
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:36.780]   a monument and a name better than sons and daughters.'"
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.340]   Now pause there and let that sink in.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.260]   Do you believe this, Ashley?
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260]   That's the question.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:58.580]   A monument and the name that will last and be more satisfying than husband's names and
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.660]   children's names and people surrounding you with family.
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:09.700]   And then he goes on, "I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off."
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.260]   Do you think your name or your identity will not be perpetuated because there are going
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:20.180]   to be no children bearing your name, no one carrying your DNA?
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:27.460]   There is something better, God says, something better that God has for you, an everlasting
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.060]   name.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:37.020]   So Ashley, the way to turn—you're asking, "How can I turn from the world?"
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:47.540]   The way to turn from the world with its lies is to stop focusing on the world and its deceptive
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:55.900]   images of pleasure, but rather to focus on the infinitely superior promises of God.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.260]   And this is one of those hundreds of promises.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.940]   I don't know if God has marriage in your future.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:03.980]   He might.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.420]   You never know.
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.180]   But I do know this.
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:18.080]   He will give you in his house and within his walls a monument and a name better than sons
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.180]   and daughters, an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:27.340]   And don't miss the thing that you're most concerned about, namely that God has no place
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.340]   for you.
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:34.860]   It says, "I will give you this in my house."
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.060]   He does want you there.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.480]   He wants you there.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:47.180]   And to be wanted by God is better than being wanted by a thousand men.
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:53.100]   Thank you, Pastor John, for addressing this question, and thank you for the email, Ashley.
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.540]   We really appreciate these kinds of personal emails that ask for advice when it comes to
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.180]   the most sensitive areas of life in this fallen world.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.140]   And as long as you have questions and as long as the Lord wills, we will continue to do
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.300]   our best to provide the answers.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.460]   As we quickly approach episode number 1,000 now in the history of this podcast, and as
