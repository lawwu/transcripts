[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   Today we talk about the various stages of progress in John Piper's becoming a Christian
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.440]   hedonist and the excellent question comes in the form of an email.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.720]   "Hello Pastor John, my name is Alanna.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.000]   Can you retell the story of your own journey into Christian hedonism?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.320]   I recall you mentioning C.S.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.540]   Lewis being a major influence on you through one of his books, but what has been the defining
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.280]   moments for you in this pursuit of the all-satisfying joy in Jesus?"
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.680]   I've got 10 steps in the story and I'll try to say them quickly.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.020]   Number one, my father was the happiest man I've ever known.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.320]   I grew up in that home, no doubt it had an impact.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.960]   Number two, my father and my mother constantly cited 1 Corinthians 10 31, "Whether you eat
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.760]   or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.120]   So I knew I've got happy parents and they're telling me constantly to pursue the glory
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.320]   of God.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:12.220]   Number three, no one made the connection for me between my joy and God's glory in any biblical
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.920]   or theological way that I can remember.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.200]   They just kind of dangled.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:26.680]   Number four, unresolved tension all through college between I want to be happy and I could
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.360]   no more desire the want to be happy than I could stop myself from getting hungry.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.680]   I think God put the desire for happiness in the human soul as a good thing rooted in our
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.480]   very human nature.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.780]   So there it was, I couldn't do anything about it and I had in the Bible and in my parents'
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.760]   memory God demands that he be glorified and those two things were in constant unresolved
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.760]   tension.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.160]   Maybe I'm just weird, but they were.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.560]   How does my passion to be happy and God's passion to be glorified fit together?
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:17.240]   Number five, the fall of 1968, first year in seminary, 22 years old, fall of 1968, a
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.360]   process of discovery was opened that lasted several years in which C.S. Lewis, Daniel
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.720]   Fuller and Jonathan Edwards conspired to make me a Christian hedonist.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.440]   Number six, it was the first step of that process.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.480]   Maybe the first step was seeing the pointer to this in Daniel Fuller's syllabus on hermeneutics,
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.200]   but here's the actual encounter.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.880]   So the weight of glory, Froman's Bookstore, Colorado Avenue, one afternoon, fall of 1968,
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.840]   opened up and here's the page I read.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.500]   The New Testament has lots to say about self-denial, but not about self-denial as an end in itself.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.200]   We are told to deny ourselves and take up our crosses in order that we may follow Christ.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.760]   And nearly every description of what we shall ultimately find if we do so contains an appeal
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.240]   to desire.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.520]   I was starting to get pins and needles running up and down my spine when I read that.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.320]   And here comes, here's what's next.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.980]   If there lurks in most modern minds the notion that to desire our own good and earnestly
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.340]   to hope for the enjoyment of it is a bad thing.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.500]   Now, that was me.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.500]   That was me.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.900]   I had this lurking sense.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.500]   That's not a good thing.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.380]   That's why they didn't fit together.
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.780]   He says, I submit this notion has crept in from Kant, Immanuel Kant, the philosopher,
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.980]   and the Stoics and is no part of the Christian faith.
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.700]   Whoa, you're kidding me.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.360]   Indeed, he goes on.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.260]   If we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:09.240]   promised in the gospels, it would seem that our Lord finds our desires not too strong,
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.140]   but too weak.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.620]   I had never heard anybody say that in my life.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.180]   Your problem, Piper, is you don't have strong enough desires.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.980]   I had never heard anybody say that.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.060]   He goes on.
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.240]   We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.660]   joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in the
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.620]   slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea.
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.660]   Last sentence, we are far too easily pleased.
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.020]   And that was the title of an entire section in Daniel Fuller's hermeneutic syllabus.
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.100]   We are far too easily pleased.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.380]   And it was a diagnosis of my soul that I had never heard before.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:08.180]   Step number seven, reflections on the Psalms, C.S. Lewis, page 93, helped me put the final
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.540]   touch on vertical Christian hedonism.
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.060]   And it went like this.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.220]   The most obvious fact about praise, whether of God or anything, strangely escaped me.
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.340]   I thought of it in terms of compliment, approval, or giving honor.
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:31.220]   I had never noticed that all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise, unless, sometimes even
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.140]   if, shyness or the fear of boring others is deliberately brought in to check it.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.980]   The world rings with praise, lovers praising their mistresses, readers their favorite poet,
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.740]   walkers praising the countryside, players praising their favorite game, praise of weather,
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:58.980]   wines, dishes, actors, motors, horses, colleges, countries, historical personages, children,
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:06.300]   flowers, mountains, rare stamps, rare beetles, even sometimes politicians and scholars.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.940]   I had not noticed how the humblest and at the same time the most balanced and capacious
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:21.980]   minds praised most, while the cranks, misfits, and malcontents praised least.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:28.100]   I had not noticed either that just as men spontaneously praise what they value, so they
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.460]   spontaneously urge us to join them in praising it.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.460]   Isn't she lovely?
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.140]   Wasn't it glorious?
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.300]   Don't you think that magnificent?
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:45.780]   The psalmists, in telling everyone to praise God, are doing what all men do when they speak
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.260]   of what they care about.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:55.060]   My whole more general difficulty about the praise of God depended on my absurdly denying
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.700]   to us as regards the supremely valuable what we delight to do, what we indeed can't help
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.380]   doing about everything else we value.
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.220]   And here it comes.
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:15.740]   I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.980]   completes the enjoyment.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.460]   It is its appointed consummation.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:30.500]   It is not out of compliment that lovers keep on telling one another how beautiful they
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.500]   are.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:40.340]   The delight is incomplete till it is expressed."
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.700]   I had never heard that before either.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.140]   So one thing was clear.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:54.580]   God's commanding praise, commanding that he be praised, was for our good because it was
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:00.620]   the consummation of our joy in him.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:07.620]   But it took, this is number eight, it took Jonathan Edwards to bring me to the even more
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:16.260]   important realization that we should pursue joy in God because it is the essence and heart
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.900]   of praise.
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:25.660]   In other words, not only is praise the consummation of joy, the completion of joy, joy in its
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:31.900]   fullness, but joy is the essence of praise.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.420]   You're not praising God if you're not enjoying God.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.060]   And that's what so many people miss.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.140]   And I got it from Edwards.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.860]   Here's the way he said it.
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.780]   God glorifies himself toward the creature in two ways.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.500]   This is from his Miscellanies.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.300]   One, by appearing to their understanding.
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:59.820]   Two, by communicating himself to their hearts and in their rejoicing and delighting in and
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.580]   enjoying the manifestations which he makes of himself.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:15.460]   God is glorified not only by his glory being seen, but by its being rejoiced in.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:27.020]   Which brought me to the clear statement, God is most glorified in me when I am most satisfied
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.340]   in him.
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:35.220]   And all these discoveries from Lewis and Edwards were confirmed throughout the Bible.
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.700]   And if we had time, we could take text after text to show them.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.140]   But let me just give the last step in my pilgrimage.
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:49.660]   All this left me to work out especially how vertical Christian hedonism, namely, God is
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.100]   most glorified in me when I'm most satisfied in him.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.860]   That doesn't take anybody else into account.
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:03.420]   How that vertical Christian hedonism worked together with horizontal Christian hedonism.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:13.580]   Namely, you can't love other people if you abandon your quest for joy in God.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.500]   Say that again, because it sounds really controversial when people hear it.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:27.100]   If you abandon your quest for joy in God, you can't love horizontally.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.500]   You can't love other people.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.780]   Why not?
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:37.780]   Because love is the overflow of joy in God that meets the needs of others.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.560]   Second Corinthians 8, 2.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.140]   You can read that for yourself.
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.180]   Or here it is more precisely.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.740]   You can see this if you just think about it.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:54.700]   Joy in God has in it by nature, joy in God has built in it as God designed it.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:07.020]   Say it again, joy in God has in it an expansive impulse to increase itself by drawing others
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:15.460]   into our experience of it, even if it costs us our lives.
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:21.820]   And so the rest of my life has been spent working out all the relations and all the
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.260]   applications of those discoveries.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.260]   Amen.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.780]   A lifetime of discoveries to come.
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.340]   An incredible story, Pastor John.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.740]   Thank you for sharing it here.
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.460]   That great quote from Lewis that we delight to praise what we enjoy.
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.980]   That also emerged in this podcast back in episode number 719 on the question of how
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.660]   do I praise others but avoid flattery?
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.940]   That episode was really interesting too.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.300]   But how can I find an episode from 2015, Tony, you ask?
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.300]   Easy.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:55.900]   Just go to online home and check out the search bar and just type in 719, 719.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.660]   Go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:04.860]   Well for married couples with kids, so much of our time is spent together in the home.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.740]   And it's one of the places where we most commonly wrong one another.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.620]   We need to learn when to stop and to repent to one another in the busy home.
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:20.100]   It's a great question on this theme coming up from a mom that's on Monday when we return.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.100]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.100]   Have a great weekend.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:22.940]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:23.180]   [END]
