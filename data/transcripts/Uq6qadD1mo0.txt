[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.420]   - We have a lot of young listeners
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.500]   who are heading into marriage
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.400]   without a lot of examples in their lives to learn from,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.180]   and they are asking some really good questions
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.980]   about the basics of marriage.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.340]   One such listener is Cassie, who writes in to ask this,
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.220]   "Hello, Pastor John, I'm engaged and need practical advice.
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.020]   "What does it mean and look like
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.060]   "for me to submit to my husband?"
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.180]   - God loves his people, God loves Cassie,
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.660]   and does not command us things that are bad for us.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.060]   That's just so basic in this issue.
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.560]   God is a good father.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.560]   He knows manhood, he knows womanhood, he knows them deeply,
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.140]   and he knows how deeply life can be beautiful together
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.220]   when these things are lived out
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.700]   according to his good purposes.
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.740]   He has given us, he's given to you, Cassie,
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.940]   amazing gifts of sexuality,
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.980]   and amazing gifts of difference between manhood and womanhood
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.300]   that go deeper than sexual organs.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.020]   We are male and female all the way down,
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.540]   and this is so great and so precious and so pervasive
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.420]   and so profound and so powerful
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.420]   that I think we would be foolish to experiment
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.060]   with it from generation to generation the way the world does.
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.300]   Like, let's just make something new out of what women are.
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.620]   Let's just make something new out of what men are.
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.620]   We would be wise with only one life to live,
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.380]   to listen to our maker, our designer,
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.300]   our father, our friend, our redeemer,
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.260]   and bring our manhood and womanhood into line
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.660]   with what he has revealed.
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.640]   So we only have time here for a few comments,
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.220]   but I've written a whole book on marriage
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.480]   that I would point you to,
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.660]   and I've written "What's the Difference
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.020]   of Manhood and Womanhood,"
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.700]   and I've edited a big blue book on this issue,
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.700]   so if this feels inadequate, it's because it is inadequate.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.140]   Never, ever stop learning and growing.
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.580]   I'm not gonna do any exegesis, for example,
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.220]   any Bible interpretation in this.
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.700]   I'm just gonna apply things I've studied,
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.540]   but if you wanna study,
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.460]   I'm taking it almost all from Genesis 1 to 3,
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.980]   Ephesians 5, 21 to 33, 1 Peter 3, 1 to 7,
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.980]   2 Timothy 2, 8 to 15, 1 Corinthians 11, 1 to 16,
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.380]   and the way the New Testament shows Christ
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.500]   and his church interacting.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.980]   So here are what?
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.020]   I think I wrote down three things, maybe.
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.060]   The first is this,
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.440]   about the meaning of wife's biblical submission.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.260]   Namely, it is a happy response
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.980]   to a husband's biblical leadership,
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.100]   or as Ephesians 5 calls it, headship.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.940]   And the point of starting here
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.940]   is that when men are doing what God calls men to do
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.920]   in a relationship and they're doing it rightly, biblically,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.420]   most women love it
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.980]   and are happy to respond to it supportively.
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.760]   So my main effort in ministry
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.260]   is to help your fiance.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.800]   But he's not, you didn't ask about him, you ask about you,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.240]   so I will try to say something directly to you,
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.760]   but really, this is so important.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.760]   Be sure you marry a man who understands his role
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.940]   and has the maturity and the humility
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.120]   to grow in the rest of his life into this role,
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.240]   into this leadership and headship.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.960]   It will be very difficult for you
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.100]   to live out your life of godly submissiveness
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.880]   if he's not a godly leader.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.120]   It's not impossible, and the Bible talks about that,
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.040]   but it will be harder, and you don't wanna choose that
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.200]   at the front end of your relationships.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.920]   Here's the second thing.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.760]   I would say that submission means
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.760]   an intelligent, happy, wise support
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.880]   for the leadership of your husband,
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.240]   and that means a few key things from him.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.240]   This simply means you love it when he leads,
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.320]   and by leading, here comes the qualification
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.640]   so you know what you're aiming at,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.300]   by leading, I don't mean he makes unilateral decisions
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.720]   without talking to you and caring what you think.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.640]   That would contradict your role
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.220]   as a fellow heir of the grace of life.
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.120]   It would contradict his role as a fallible follower of Jesus.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.760]   He's not Jesus.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.280]   He's not your ultimate Lord.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.000]   Jesus is, and he knows that, and he wants to honor that
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   and encourage you in your personal submission to
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.320]   and following of Jesus, so he doesn't put himself
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.880]   in the place of your all-controlling Lord.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.320]   He knows Jesus alone holds that,
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.760]   so what I mean by his leadership
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.360]   is that he takes initiative.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.760]   He says, "Let's," most often.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.720]   That's sometimes a little thing I say to a couple.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.920]   I say, "Who says, 'Let's,' most often in this relationship?"
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.360]   And if she's the one who has to constantly say,
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.160]   "Let's do this and let's do this and let's do this
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.280]   "and let's do this," and he's just a slough off,
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.920]   then that's a problem.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.920]   He should be taking initiative in family devotions.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.680]   He should be taking initiative
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.600]   in the discipline of the children.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.520]   He should be taking initiative in financial responsibility.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.240]   He should be taking initiative
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.680]   in the moral standards of the home,
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.880]   in patterns of giving, in church life,
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.360]   and on and on and on.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.880]   When I say he takes initiative,
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.880]   I don't mean that he takes charge in any detailed way,
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.920]   as if he should run everything.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.040]   Well, he shouldn't run everything.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.080]   Here's an example.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.240]   Let me try to make it concrete.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.480]   If I say, "Take initiative in finances, man.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.320]   "Don't drag your feet with regard to how the money is made,
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.000]   "how the money is saved, how the money is invested,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.520]   "how the money is spent, how the money is given.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.480]   "Don't drag your feet here and expect your wife
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.940]   "to solve all these problems.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.800]   "You are the one that should take initiative."
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.080]   And what I mean by initiative is, he says things like,
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.040]   "Can we talk about our finances
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.000]   "to make sure that we're living in our means
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.920]   "and honoring the Lord with our money?"
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.500]   And then he might say, "You know,
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.920]   "I'm not very good with these numbers,
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.680]   "and you were a math major,
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.560]   "so how about you keep the checkbook
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.580]   "and write the checks for the utilities and so on?"
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.580]   In other words, leadership doesn't mean doing it all.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.000]   Leadership means sitting down at the table,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.120]   taking the initiative to put things in motion
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.520]   that solve problems.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.720]   Women love to have their husbands take initiative
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.120]   to put things in motion to get problems solved.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.800]   Of course, they want to be part of the solution
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   and ought to be a part of the solution,
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.240]   but oh, how sad it is when they have to drag their husbands
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.840]   to the table to get something going like that.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.000]   In other words, a good wife, a submissive wife,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.440]   may have more competency than her husband
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.880]   in lots of areas.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.700]   She might.
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.640]   They both recognize that,
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.920]   and they set up the management of the home
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.760]   in various ways that show that.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.680]   Leadership doesn't mean superior competencies.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.520]   Good night.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.480]   You know, I'm a pastor.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.800]   I was surrounded by people with superior competencies
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.080]   than I was, but I was leader.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.760]   It was my job, maximize those competencies,
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.240]   figure out a way to solve the problems here
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.920]   and set the tone here and cast a vision here
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.280]   that releases those competencies.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.360]   So submission wants a husband to lead.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.860]   She wants him to make things happen,
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.200]   put things in motion, take initiative.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.680]   Here's the last thing.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.200]   I would say that besides being an intelligent,
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.680]   happy, wise support for the leadership of the husband,
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.160]   that way, submission means that in principle,
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.440]   in the rare cases where the two of you,
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.440]   after arguing four days about what should be done,
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.960]   it's a draw and you haven't persuaded him
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.360]   and he hasn't persuaded you,
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.400]   the submissive wife says to the husband,
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.480]   "I'm going to trust you to do what's right here."
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.360]   And she may disagree with which way he's going,
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.520]   but she is going to, in those,
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.080]   and I think they're very rare,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.480]   those situations are probably very rare,
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.280]   she's going to yield in principle to whatever he says.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.840]   And the reason I say in principle
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.520]   is because a good husband at that moment
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.720]   might use that privilege to go her way.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.960]   He may love her, he may want to be gracious to her,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.200]   he may not want to take that authority here
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.520]   and wield it in a direction she doesn't want to go
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.760]   because he loves her.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.000]   And so he may just say, "No, we'll do it your way."
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.280]   But she has sent the message loud and clear to him,
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.240]   "I will not put my foot down and say,
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.380]   "you must do it my way.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.080]   "We're going to go your way
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.280]   "and I'm going to trust you to do what's right."
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.120]   And I would just end by qualifying that two ways.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.320]   One, a good husband will sometimes yield,
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.160]   even though she has given him the privilege,
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.000]   so she yields.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.160]   And the second qualification is
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.640]   a wife never follows her husband into sin.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.440]   So the headship of the husband is not ultimate headship,
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.200]   Christ is the ultimate headship,
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.940]   and she will always seek to do the right thing
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.320]   and not sin if her husband calls her
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.280]   to follow him into sin.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.040]   So here's my summary for Cassie.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.800]   Number one, God knows what's best for us
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.480]   and his way of submission and headship is the path of joy.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.760]   Number two, be sure to marry a man mature enough
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.480]   and humble enough to lead biblically.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.120]   Number three, submission is mainly an intelligent,
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.240]   happy, wise support for that leadership.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.080]   Four, which means that submission is a responsiveness
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.880]   to his initiative taking,
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.240]   which is not comprehensive control,
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.720]   but involves you in the planning of the family life.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.520]   Five, submission means that in a draw,
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.820]   you say, "I trust you to do what's best."
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.080]   And six, submission means ultimately submission to Jesus
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.060]   so that you never follow your husband into sin.
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.760]   - Very helpful outline, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.720]   And thank you, Cassie, for the great question.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.560]   If you have a question,
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.600]   please send it in to us via email
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.120]   at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org,
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.640]   and you've probably learned by now,
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.860]   great questions are essential to what we do,
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.680]   so please keep sending them in to us.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.820]   In this episode, Pastor John mentioned three books.

[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.280]   from DesiringGod.org,

[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.260]   not just a chapter or an excerpt, but the whole thing.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.520]   Those titles are these,
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.480]   This Momentary Marriage, What's the Difference?
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.280]   and Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood.

[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.880]   and Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood.

[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.920]   inspired from our series we did with Tim Keller.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.760]   I'm your host Tony Renke.
