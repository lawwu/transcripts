[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   On Monday, we talked about the relationship between Christian hedonism and historic reform
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.480]   theology. Today, we look at your fears and your hopes for this movement, Pastor John,
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.640]   when you're gone. The question comes in from a friend of the ministry who asks this, "Pastor
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.800]   John, it seems to me that after someone comes along with a paradigm-shifting theology or
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.520]   philosophy like you have done with Christian hedonism, one of two things can happen with
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.080]   the next generation that takes up the cause. One, they can lose some of the balance of
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.900]   the original, provocatively overemphasizing certain aspects and minimizing certain qualifications
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.120]   or nuances and thereby distorting it. Or two, they can go deeper with the theology or philosophy,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.880]   applying it to areas the original champion could not or did not. As you think about the
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.080]   future of Christian hedonism, Pastor John, when you're off the scene someday, are there
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.360]   A, some dangers that you would call the next generation to avoid, and B, some areas you
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.240]   hope they would explore in greater depth or application? Pastor John, what would you say?"
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.920]   Pastor John Lutzer Let's do dangers first, because in a sense,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.240]   you could say that what needs to be done positively is avoid the dangers.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:26.200]   Dangers are everywhere, everywhere, and that's true with every single doctrine in the Bible.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:35.440]   There are no truth claims that are not surrounded by potential distortions of that very truth.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.920]   So nothing unique about Christian hedonism here. Every single truth in the Bible is beset
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.600]   with imminent distortion by the deceptions of the human heart. So let me just name, what
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.560]   have I got here? I'm looking at my list. Eight. Okay, here we go. Eight dangers. One, there
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.880]   is the danger that people will begin to treat pleasure as the criterion of what is good.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.800]   If it brings pleasure, it is good, they will say. That's wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Instead,
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:16.320]   we ought to say that the Bible defines what is good objectively, and the path of that
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:24.640]   good ought, ought to give us pleasure and lead to pleasure. And the great quest of sanctification
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.680]   is to experience that pleasure in the doing of good. Okay, that's danger number one. Number
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:40.160]   two, a related danger is that we would cease to pursue pleasure by seeking the transformation
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:49.120]   of our sinful preferences, and instead pursue pleasure by changing the Bible to fit our
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:58.620]   preferences. That's danger number two. Number three, there is the danger of losing the proper
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.760]   role of reason in shaping and governing the affections by comprehending the true meaning
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.860]   of the Scripture and applying it in a transforming way to our hearts. It's no accident that
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.560]   even though my writings are shot through with an emphasis on the place of the affections
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:32.780]   in giving glory to God, I wrote a whole book called "Think! Think! Think!" Yes, think again!
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:41.380]   It is a great danger, and a frightening world in which people with strong emotions cannot
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:50.420]   be reasoned with according to a rationally comprehended authoritative text. Oh, I'm reading
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.660]   right now a biography of General Grant, Ulysses S. Grant, and the season of slaughter from
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.480]   the Ku Klux Klan in the decade after the Civil War was horrific, and there was no recourse.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.200]   They were irrational, like animals! And oh, what a horrible, dangerous, terrifying thing
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.480]   it is to be faced by a mob of unreasoning people who will not draw any just conclusions
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.620]   from proper premises. So, think, think, think!
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.500]   Number four, there is the danger of minimizing the role of discipline and willpower in the
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:37.620]   pursuit of spontaneous joy and treating spontaneity as the very definition of authenticity, which
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:47.000]   it isn't. A great deal of life is lived by the fruit of the spirit called self-control,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.820]   and if we put such a premium on spontaneous emotion as the only proper strategy for doing
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.380]   good, we will certainly go astray.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:07.400]   Number five, there is the danger of confusing natural emotions with supernatural affections.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   They overlap, and they penetrate into each other. They're not the same. And if we don't
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:22.620]   make the distinction properly between supernatural affections and natural emotions, we will soon
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.400]   reduce supernatural Christianity to naturalistic psychology.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:37.200]   Number six, there is the danger of oversimplifying the complexities of the human soul and the
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.800]   complexities of the process of sanctification and the complexities of human relationships
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:56.300]   in acts of love. Real life is not simple, and emotional life is anything but simple.
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:03.540]   And a great danger exists when simplistic people have no experience with complexity,
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.580]   no sense of nuance whatsoever—don't even know what I'm talking about right now—when
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:14.580]   simplistic people with little insight into the complex nature of the human being and
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.320]   relationships start making pronouncements about complex things.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:28.820]   Number seven, there's the danger of becoming a one-trick pony where we emphasize Christian
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:36.640]   hedonism proper to the neglect of the whole counsel of God in Scripture, or we wear such
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:44.540]   hedonism-colored glasses that when we see texts, all we see is hedonism when it's not
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.060]   even there in those texts.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:56.580]   Number eight, and finally on the dangers, you can see really that behind all these dangers
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:07.540]   is the failure to preserve a proper grasp of and esteem for the authority and objectivity
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:15.500]   of the Scriptures and the way they exert their authority both through a rational comprehension
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.800]   of them and a spiritual transformation by them.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:28.560]   The Scriptures themselves will always be the watershed issue till Jesus comes.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.980]   Whether any particular theological viewpoint is sound or not sound, balanced or imbalanced,
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:43.640]   will be decided on this watershed issue of the truth and understandableness of the Scriptures.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:52.220]   So, with regard to areas I hope people would explore in greater depth or application, one
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:59.040]   answer would be give a good deal of energy to those eight pitfalls, and go deep with
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.580]   your analysis of Scripture and the human soul that you give expression to Christian hedonism
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:10.260]   in ways that would minimize those dangers and maximize fruitfulness.
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:16.220]   I think one way to describe what needs to be done is to bring Christian hedonism into
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:22.140]   direct exegetical and theological contact with certain significant themes and realities
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.220]   in Scripture, and probe those interrelationships.
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.260]   I have in mind, for example, saving faith.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.540]   I'd love to do that myself if the Lord gives me more time.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:39.100]   How is saving faith related to God-glorifying joy in Christ?
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:46.500]   Or I think a good deal more needs to be done on the nature of love, mainly love towards
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.500]   people.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:54.180]   Paul says love seeks not its own, really, but he also says it is more satisfying to
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.540]   give than to receive.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.660]   So should you seek that?
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.460]   And he says love rejoices in the truth.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.460]   Rejoices!
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.520]   Rejoices in the truth!
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.320]   So if you're not rejoicing in the truth, are you loving?
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.860]   And so joy is essential to love.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.260]   Or is it?
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:16.140]   And he asks, what profit is it if you give your whole body to be burned and don't have
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.700]   love?
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:24.540]   So seeking profit is okay because he just argued that you don't get any if you don't
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.540]   love?
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:32.200]   I mean, there's just so much to be done here with texts on the nature of love and how it
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.060]   works with the pursuit of Christ-exalting joy.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:43.020]   I think there needs to be very serious consideration about the relationship between self-denial
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.300]   in Christian hedonism.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.740]   Jesus clearly says we must deny ourselves and take up our cross if we're going to be
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:54.380]   His disciples, and Paul certainly embraced a life of suffering more than any of us has.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:10:01.500]   He embraced, he pursued a life of suffering, and yet he said, "I rejoice in my sufferings."
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.580]   So were his sufferings self-denial?
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:09.980]   I mean, how were they self-denial if they were the place where he found joy?
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:16.500]   I think the state of corporate worship in America on Sunday morning cries out for a
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:23.620]   great deal of theological and biblical reflection about the relationship between joy and reverence
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:30.780]   and the kinds of liturgical activity, or shall we say, the structure of the service that
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:39.620]   will build a kind of mindset in the people over the decades that will fit them to relate
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:46.340]   to God as He really is, and also be humble and courageous, standing for truth.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:52.020]   In other words, I sense that there are ways of doing corporate worship that Christian
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:59.240]   hedonism speaks into that over the decades, without that speaking, will produce a kind
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.820]   of saint that isn't ready for what we're going to face.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:09.040]   I think the need is great for there to be people with profound insight into the human
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:15.860]   psyche, and profound insight into biblical truth, who can probe the relationship between
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:23.780]   Christian hedonism and various forms of mental illness, from the least serious to the most
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.020]   serious.
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.420]   That's probably enough for now.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:34.740]   Let me just reiterate that both with regard to dangers and potentials to be explored,
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:41.300]   that I think the heart of the matter is always going to be biblical authority and biblical
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.660]   meaning rightly apprehended and rightly applied.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:54.260]   The Bible will be the watershed for preventing dangers and for wonderful floods of new insight.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.460]   Amen, that's a good word for this movement that you've generated by God's grace.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.020]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that word.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.340]   Thanks for listening to the podcast over at our online home.

[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:24.820]   Well, this week we're looking at Christian hedonism and we end the week looking at the
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.580]   book title and the ministry title, Desiring God.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.380]   Where did that title come from and aren't there better ones that better fit what we
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.380]   do?
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.380]   It's a really good question.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.380]   It's on the table Friday.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.380]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.500]   We'll see you then.
