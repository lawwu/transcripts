[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.480]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All the Hacks,
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.600]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.200]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.920]   to optimize my own life by sitting down each week with the world's best experts
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.400]   to learn the strategies, tactics and frameworks that shape their success.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.920]   Today, I'm talking with Annie Duke, a former professional poker player
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.720]   turned bestselling author and what I'll call a professional decision maker.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.000]   Her 2018 bestseller, Thinking in Bets, Making Smarter Decisions
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.800]   When You Don't Have All the Facts, explored how life is more like poker than chess
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.360]   and has helped countless people make better decisions.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.680]   And her latest book, Quit, The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away,
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.760]   is all about learning to quit well, which is a skill that can not only be learned,
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.760]   but that should be learned and practiced by just about everyone.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.680]   We're going to talk about making good decisions, getting better at quitting,
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.160]   but more specifically, why learning the difference between luck
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.760]   and the quality of your decisions is so important and how that can improve
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.400]   your life and your career.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.840]   Why just looking at the outcome of decisions isn't enough.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.720]   What forces work against good quitting behavior and why so many people
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840]   struggle with the decision to walk away?
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.680]   How to use kill criteria to determine when to quit a project,
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.080]   a job or some other endeavor and a lot more.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.280]   So let's get going.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.280]   Annie, welcome to the show.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.360]   Thanks for being here.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.160]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.560]   You say there are only two factors in how life turns out.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.520]   Luck and the quality of your decisions.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.080]   You don't have control over luck,
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.560]   but you do have control over the quality of the decisions you make.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.640]   How can people tell the difference between the two and more importantly,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.120]   improve the quality of the decisions they make?
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.680]   Yeah, so that's like the sixty four thousand dollar question.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.520]   So let's just first of all say, like when you make a decision,
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.440]   there's two forces that are going to influence
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.120]   that outcome of the decision, right?
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.840]   One is luck and one is the quality of the decision itself.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.360]   Now, luck is a form of uncertainty that exerts itself on the outcome, right?
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.840]   So I could make a choice that's going to work out ninety five percent of the time.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.880]   That means by definition, five percent of the time
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.840]   I'm going to observe a bad outcome and I have no control
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.760]   over when I'm going to observe that five percent.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.360]   What's important to good decision making is to accept
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.800]   that luck exists and try to see it clearly.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.360]   So what we want to do is know that this is a ninety five percent
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.120]   to five percent good to bad ratio on the outcomes
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.480]   that I could see and not believe something else.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.360]   So if we forecast that it will work out ninety five percent of the time,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.720]   but it's actually only going to work out sixty five percent of the time,
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.200]   that would be a problem.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.840]   So it's not about like controlling luck because you can't definitionally.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.120]   It's about being able to forecast appropriately
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.040]   how luck might exert its influence, what the influence of luck on the outcome
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.240]   might be.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.120]   And we know from a lot of work in cognitive bias, for example,
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.840]   that there's all sorts of different ways in which we don't see luck very well.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.000]   The illusion of control.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   We think we have more control
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.840]   over the way that things are going to turn out than we do actually.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.000]   Or over optimism and overconfidence, for example, are ways in which we will
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.040]   just sort of misassign the probabilities of different outcomes
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.480]   that might occur in the future.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.080]   So that's the luck side.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.080]   So part of a good quality decision is to be a good forecaster of these things,
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   to start to see the outcomes in the way that they actually are true to reality,
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.480]   what ground truth actually is, as opposed to what our brains
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.080]   sort of think they are.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.440]   So that's piece number one.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.880]   Piece number two, the other form of uncertainty
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.200]   that is going to exert itself on the quality of the outcome
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.840]   that we might observe, and in fact, the quality of the decision
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.880]   that we're making is just hidden information.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.080]   So for most things that we're deciding about, we know very little
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.440]   in comparison to all there is to be known.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.120]   The stuff we know fits on like the head of a pin.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.200]   The stuff we don't know is like the size of the whole universe.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.760]   I'm sure you've had that feeling, Chris, of saying, I wish I knew then
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.400]   what I know now all the time.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.000]   Right. So that's just hidden information.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.680]   You're just sort of seeing the influence of hidden information
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.120]   that you sort of realize, if I knew then what I know now,
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.120]   I may have made a different choice.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.280]   Why? Because when we're thinking about those forecasts that we make, right?
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.560]   I'm considering a decision
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.600]   and I'm thinking about what the possible outcomes are.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.040]   Each of those outcomes has a payoff associated with it.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.400]   Each of those outcomes has a probability associated with it.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.360]   So when we think about our beliefs, the things that we believe to be true,
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.600]   they're determining for us how we think any option
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.800]   that we're considering might turn out right.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   What we believe to be true of the world is going to influence
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.840]   what we think the possible outcomes are of any decision
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.560]   that we might be considering, what the payoffs are associated with those
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.120]   and what the probability of those are.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.960]   And in fact, our beliefs are going to inform other things as well,
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.200]   like what options we might actually consider.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.960]   We're usually considering more than one options.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.280]   They're going to inform what we think our goals are.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.360]   What is the point that we want to be heading toward?
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.760]   So beliefs change over time, not as much as they should,
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.560]   but they do change over time.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.800]   And those beliefs are always going to be imperfect.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.600]   There's always going to be inaccuracies in the things that we believe
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.520]   because we're partially behind the veil of ignorance.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.040]   We don't know a whole lot.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.640]   So that's the second way in which we can think about
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.760]   how do we actually improve the forecast?
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.920]   We can consider from the option that we're making a decision
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.960]   about going forward, seeing the luck very clearly.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.920]   But then we can take a step back and say, well, if beliefs are at the center
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.120]   of that, they're the foundation, really, of every decision we make.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.480]   That's a place that we can really start to focus our energy
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.720]   on improving the quality of the beliefs that we have.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.800]   Is there a common decision you think people make
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.440]   where this kind of really comes to life?
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.720]   Well, it's like every decision,
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.360]   but one of the ones that I love to think about is hiring.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.320]   In hiring, we can see all sorts of different things at play,
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.080]   but we can see a basic decision.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.080]   You have some idea of what your goal is, what you want to hire for,
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.640]   what your values are, so that's going to be the rec, the job description.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.920]   But that's going to have to do with things like who's the person
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.040]   that you think is going to be right for the role?
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.000]   What's the role that you think you need to be hiring for?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.240]   Which is sometimes not explored enough.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.080]   Then you get lots of resumes in and you start to try to fit
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.360]   the resumes to what you think that you want.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.360]   And those are different options that you're considering,
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.000]   different people that you're thinking about hiring.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   There's other options you're considering, like what's the comp going to be?
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.560]   What's going to be the balance of, say, equity to cash?
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.960]   The balance of guaranteed comp versus bonus, things like that.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.000]   But we'll put those aside and just think of the options,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   which are the people that you're considering hiring into the role.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.560]   And then for any of those people that you're considering,
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.520]   whether you know it or not, you're thinking about
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.600]   what are the chances this person is going to work out?
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.560]   What's the chances they're not?
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.960]   Now, we don't often do that explicitly,
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.600]   but it's an implicit in any decision that we make.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.840]   And there's a lot of luck that influences the outcome.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.600]   So let's think about that and the hidden information.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.960]   In terms of the hidden information,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.560]   as you're considering each of those people to fill the open rack.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.200]   Well, OK, you have a CV.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.520]   You have a few references and a couple of interviews.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.600]   They haven't worked at your company for a long time.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.400]   You don't really know if they're going to be a good fit.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.440]   You don't know really what their work ethic is.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.920]   You have a little bit of idea, but you don't really find out
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.880]   most of the things that you would want to know
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.680]   until after you've decided whether to hire them or not.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.480]   And separate from that, all the people that you say no to,
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.880]   you have no idea how they would have turned out.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.760]   So we can see this hidden information problem.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.600]   I sort of say like with hiring, it's kind of like marrying someone
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.520]   after a couple of dates and two friends telling you they're cool.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.440]   People do that, by the way.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.240]   And what do we all think when they do that?
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.440]   Wow, you're kind of nuts.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.080]   You know, when they're like, oh, I'm in love.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.560]   And your first date was a week ago.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.600]   You're heading to Vegas, really?
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.240]   But that's kind of what hiring is.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.480]   It's like eloping to Vegas after a week
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.640]   because of the hidden information.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.680]   And then what happens is that you find things out after the fact and you say,
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.240]   I wish I had known that before I hired them.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.120]   And then in terms of luck, when you hire anybody,
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.800]   the probability of the person working out, it depends on sort of
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.800]   how you cut the data, is around 50/50.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.880]   And that's just a lot of luck, right?
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.320]   You sort of think they're going to be a fit.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.800]   Do they turn out to be a fit?
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.600]   Does something happen in their personal life
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.680]   like after you hire them that you couldn't have known about beforehand?
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.920]   So and so forth.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.680]   It's just a very kind of noisy decision.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.480]   Now, you can do things to improve the quality of the decision,
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.280]   to increase the probability of getting a good outcome
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.520]   to somewhere between 60 and 65 percent.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.400]   But that's about as far as you can push it.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.880]   It's just too uncertain.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.400]   So hiring is one of those places where it's like super clear
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.920]   that you can see the problems with this kind of decision making.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.640]   Investing is another.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.800]   But there's obviously a huge influence of luck
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.320]   on the way that your investments turn out.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.360]   Just look at the pandemic.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.200]   Nobody had control over that.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.040]   And it had all sorts of effects on the stock market supply chain issues,
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.520]   which I don't control.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.560]   What are those things?
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.000]   You said there are a few things you can do.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.200]   I now feel like I totally get why the decision might be outside of my control.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.480]   But it seems like there's a part of it that is in your control.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.400]   Oh, there is.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.760]   So the first thing you can do is make yourself familiar
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.960]   with a concept called base rates.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.880]   This is really important.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.080]   So if we go to that first thing that I said,
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.840]   that we're not very good at understanding
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.040]   what the probability of any event occurring is, know your base rates.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.120]   A base rate is how often something occurs
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.800]   in a situation similar to the one that you're considering.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.920]   Simple. All right.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.600]   So I'll give you a really simple example of a base rate.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.520]   So let's just take your morning routine, right?
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.440]   You're trying to decide when to wake up.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.040]   Because you need to decide how long does it take me to get ready in the morning
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.240]   so that I know when I need to get into my car in order to get to work on time.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.560]   So this is something that people do, you know, every morning,
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.920]   at least before the pandemic, before we're all online.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.040]   There's a whole bunch of base rates involved in there, right?
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.760]   So one is how long does it, on average, take me to get ready?
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.280]   OK, so I could figure that out.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.480]   I could track that for you over a certain period of time
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.320]   and figure out, on average, how long it takes you to get ready.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.600]   I could even figure out a lower bound and an upper bound.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.400]   That's going to tell you sort of like something about risk.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.520]   What's the volatility?
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.920]   And then you can sort of figure out for yourself how much risk you want to take on,
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.040]   like how important is it for you to get to where you're going exactly on time?
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.280]   You would want to be at sort of account for the upper bound
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.720]   of how long it takes you to get ready.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.560]   If you have some slack in there,
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.800]   you could account for the lower bound of how long it takes you to get ready.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.560]   But we can figure out, on average, how long does it take you to get ready?
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.560]   And in fact, when you're deciding when to set your alarm,
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.640]   that's included in your decision, just not explicitly, right?
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.680]   Then when we think about, OK, I've got to get in my car
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.760]   and figure out when do I need to be in my car in order to go to work?
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.640]   That's another base rate that we're considering, which is, on average,
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.520]   how long does it take me to get to work on the route that I'm considering taking?
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.680]   So that's for you personally.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.400]   We could figure out those base rates.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.560]   But there's all sorts of base rates in the world as well.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.720]   I gave you one just a second ago, depending on how you cut the data,
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.880]   your chances of successful hire are about 50/50.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.560]   That's a base rate.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.600]   So when I'm sitting here thinking in what we talked about,
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.720]   like being overoptimistic, illusion of control, overconfidence,
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.120]   those kinds of things, when I'm saying I'm a great person at hiring,
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.240]   when I talk to someone, I can look into their eyes
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.160]   and I can figure out whether they're going to be a good fit or not.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.080]   And I'm great at this.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.000]   So you say to me, well, what do you think the probability is
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.240]   when you hire for this role that it's going to work out?
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.640]   And I say, oh, I think it's going to work out 90% of the time.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.200]   Well, that's too far away from the base rate to be sane.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.840]   So what base rates do is they give us a starting point
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.280]   for the forecast that we're going to make, that forecast of what's
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.360]   the probability that things will work out one way or another.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.760]   And if I know that the base rate is about 50/50 and I'm estimating
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.600]   that I'm going to successfully hire 90% of the time,
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.160]   I need to discipline myself to that base rate.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.760]   Now, maybe I am better than the average bear.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.880]   But I can't be that much better than the average bear.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.800]   Right. That's the thing.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.600]   So maybe I can say, oh, I'm great, I'll be 60%.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.240]   But notice how far that is away from 90%.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.400]   So it's just disciplining you to the base right now.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.160]   I actually do research on this with Phil Tetlock, who wrote Super Forecasting,
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.680]   along with his collaborator and wife, Barb Mellors.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.160]   And this is the single most important thing we found in getting people
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.080]   to be better estimators of probabilities and outcomes in the future
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.840]   is to teach them about race rates and start to discipline their guests,
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.520]   give them that starting point of a base rate.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.160]   So that's the first thing that you can do for anything you're considering.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.960]   Try to figure out what's the base rate, what's the appropriate reference class.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.840]   So if I want to figure out how long it's going to take me to get to work
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.400]   and I live in Philadelphia,
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.440]   I shouldn't ask how long it takes people to get to work in Cincinnati.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.800]   It doesn't have anything to do with me.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.240]   So you want to get the right group that you're comparing to.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.480]   If I'm thinking about hiring, I could look at averages for all hires.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.520]   But if, say, a SaaS startup, I can look at average turnover at SaaS startups.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.800]   Right. And that gives me a really good base rate to start from.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.120]   So that's piece number one is know your base rate.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.640]   So that has to do with seeing that look really clearly.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.840]   Piece number two is improve the quality of the information that you're getting.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.680]   And the way to do that, honestly, the best way that you can do that
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.400]   is to start gathering independent viewpoints on the problem that you're considering.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.360]   OK, so we can go back to the hiring example.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.800]   When you're thinking about creating the job description,
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.280]   figure out a group of people that are going to be on the hiring committee
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.120]   and are appropriate to be giving input into what you think that role requires.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.840]   So let's say we're talking about like a C-level executive.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.640]   Let's say it's like a CRO.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.280]   We would want the CMO to be involved, certainly the CEO.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.760]   You may want the chief product officer involved.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.640]   You want customer success involved.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.080]   You want people who are doing enablement, so on and so forth.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.720]   So you want to get the people who are sort of like in that function
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.800]   and then the other leaders that person is going to be interacting with.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.600]   So you figure out who the people are that you think should give input on this.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.560]   And when it's a personal decision, let's say I'm trying to decide
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.560]   if I should buy a house, do I build a group of people that I get feedback from?
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.000]   Or how do you apply that to a normal, non-professional decision
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.720]   where there's teams involved?
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.200]   Yes, 100%, you should find people that you get opinions from.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.920]   But here's the really important thing.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.160]   You need to ask them independently and asynchronously.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.360]   For C-level, you would do a little more work, write a job description,
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.240]   describe this person to a recruiter,
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.160]   and you're asking them to do this all independently.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.200]   What are the near term challenges, near term opportunities,
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.080]   far term challenges, things like that.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.320]   So you're just asking for tell me independently
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.280]   what you think this role should be.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.960]   Now, why are you asking them independently?
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.800]   Because otherwise they're going to influence each other.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.080]   OK, so when you're asking for your own self,
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.520]   you want to use that same principle of how do I get independent information?
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.960]   And that's to say you give them a bunch of facts.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.840]   I'm thinking about buying a house.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.760]   I assume you're currently renting in that case.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.880]   I'm currently renting.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.840]   This is the location I rent in.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.080]   This is how much money I pay and rent in utilities.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.160]   This is how much I'm making.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.960]   This is the estimate that I have of my job stability.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.360]   Here's the area that I'm thinking about buying in.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.760]   Whatever you give them the facts.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.160]   Now, notice nowhere have I said, but here's my concern.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.480]   Like renting gives me all sorts of flexibility.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.560]   If I get a house, then I'm kind of tied down to that house.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.280]   And what if I don't like it?
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:51.120]   And I'm thinking that maybe given the percentage of my total net worth
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.120]   that I would have to put into the house, it's too much,
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.920]   which is the way that I would normally ask.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.800]   Like if you're sort of left to your own devices, that's the way you ask things.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.600]   In the simplest sense of if I say to you, I thought Queen's Gambit
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.120]   was such a great show, what did you think?
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.040]   You've done that before.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.400]   We all do that. Right.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.040]   Instead, what you want to say is, did you watch Queen's Gambit?
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.360]   And you say, yes, I assume. Yes.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.320]   And then I say, what did you think of it?
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.640]   And I completely withhold my opinion from you.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.560]   Now, this is really hard to do.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.200]   It's incredibly unnatural.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.080]   We think about our opinion as being important data for the other person to have.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.920]   But the issue is that the opinion that I'm about to offer you
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.520]   is actually the information that I'm trying to get from you.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.280]   So if I give you my opinion first,
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.560]   I'm not going to get your opinion in a way that's actually going to be helpful for me.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.160]   So instead, what I want to do is just offer you up the facts
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.760]   that you need in order to give me a good opinion
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.200]   and then just get your opinion back in a uncontaminated way.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.040]   So when I say I'm currently renting and this is how much my rent is
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.800]   and this is my family situation and this is how much money I have saved
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.760]   and this how much I make and I'm thinking about buying a house,
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.080]   I would just love your opinion on that.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.720]   Tell me what you know. Tell me what you think.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.880]   Right. So I've given you the facts that you need,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.680]   and now you can tell me all sorts of things about what you think.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.120]   And what you want to do is get a good range of people
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.440]   who have kind of differing schools of thought, if possible,
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.280]   and find out what they think and then explore that.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.120]   And then you'll have collected all the data.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.000]   You can go back to them and say, well, I had another opinion
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.520]   that was kind of saying this.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.680]   I'd love to hear what you think about that.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.360]   But you've allowed them to express themselves in a way
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.600]   where they don't have to disagree with you.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.400]   They don't know what you already think,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.200]   because mostly when we're having conversations,
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.080]   we're just trying to affirm the other person.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:51.080]   So even if I did disagree with you or you disagreed with me
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.280]   and you thought the Queen's Gambit was a terrible show,
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.520]   you would say it in a super nice way instead of me just saying,
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.840]   what do you think of the Queen's Gambit?
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.400]   And you're like, oh, that's horrible.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.920]   It's much more stressful on the other side.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.520]   Someone asks you a question with no opinion.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.960]   You're like, oh, I don't know what to say.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.400]   I don't want to offend.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.080]   You have to give people permission to do that.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.040]   Say, look, I'm really trying to just get your opinion here.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.040]   So I'm not going to tell you what I think.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.960]   And I'm not going to be offended by your response.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.800]   So I am quite comfortable right now,
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.360]   which is actually true almost every day.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.680]   And that's thanks to Viore.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.320]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.600]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.640]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.000]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.800]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.600]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.840]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.640]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.920]   unless you're wearing Viore,
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.680]   in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.480]   And it's not just for men.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.280]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.920]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.400]   I think I have three pairs,
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.440]   and they are probably the most comfortable pants
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.520]   I've ever owned.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.400]   Their products can be used for just about any activity,
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.840]   whether it's running, training, or yoga.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.320]   They're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.240]   or their MetaPants can even work for a night out.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.320]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.800]   And for all the Hacks listeners,
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.600]   they are offering 20% off your first purchase,
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.440]   as well as free shipping and returns on US orders over $75.

[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.800]   at allthehacks.com/viore,
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.640]   or in the link in the show notes.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.640]   Again, go to allthehacks.com/v-u-o-r-i,
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.920]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.000]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.760]   I want to tell you all about the most amazing way
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.120]   to buy a second home.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.160]   And I know because we actually bought one
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.000]   for 1/8 the cost.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.120]   And don't worry, I'm not talking timeshares,
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.760]   I'm talking about Picasso,
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.280]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.240]   So how does it work?
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.640]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.120]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.120]   creates an LLC for each home,
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.160]   and you can buy as little as 1/8 of the property.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.480]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.360]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:09.360]   handling design, cleaning, bills, repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.400]   And the scheduling system makes it fair and equitable
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.680]   for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.320]   When we found Picasso, it felt like it was made just for us.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.440]   That same week, we found the perfect place in Napa,
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.400]   we toured it, and the next week we were closing.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.840]   Since then, it's truly become our second home,
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.560]   and it's been so amazing.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.760]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.120]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price,
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.440]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.600]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resell in 12 days
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.960]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.200]   For a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.280]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.840]   where our listeners will get a free Picasso access account,
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.480]   which means you can see new listings
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.280]   before they go on the website
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.360]   and get up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.280]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.640]   P-A-C-A-S-S-O.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.640]   - So understanding the base rates
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.360]   so you have a sense of what you're expecting,
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.200]   which I guess we can get into how that might affect
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.080]   resulting in the future, knowing that you had an opinion
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.560]   and you weren't as far off
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.480]   and you don't judge your decision incorrectly.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.840]   And then asking people with a more objective manner
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.360]   to get their feedback,
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.280]   any other big things to make a better decision?
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.000]   - As much as possible, try to write things down
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.760]   that you're deciding about.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.280]   Get other people, trusted advisors,
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.920]   particularly people who have different points of view
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.040]   with you are really important.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.040]   Here's a really important one, you have to give permission.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:50.280]   So when we're trying to seek information from other people,
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.240]   we think that permission is implied
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.880]   for them to say whatever to us,
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.280]   but we have to actually offer that permission
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.400]   and they have to be willing to give it to us.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.880]   I'm sure this has happened to you.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.840]   You fire someone or you break up with somebody or whatever.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.960]   And as soon as you do that,
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.920]   you have a whole bunch of friends who say,
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.160]   "Oh, I'm so glad you did that.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.320]   "I thought you should have done that like six months ago."
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.120]   Has that one happened to you?
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.720]   - Well, that one hasn't 'cause my wife and I
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.760]   started dating, oh gosh, 2004.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.960]   So it's been a long time since I've had that conversation.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.880]   I'm sure it has.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.120]   - Or you fire someone or you quit your job or--
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.520]   - Yeah, for sure. - Whatever.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.360]   And people say,
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.840]   "I bet you might've said it to somebody when they break up.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.800]   "Like, oh, I'm so happy 'cause really,
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.600]   "wish you would've done that sooner."
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.080]   So this is like a really common thing that happens.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.640]   "Oh, I'm so happy you quit your job.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.400]   "Like you were so miserable every single day.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.200]   "I knew you should have done that like a long time ago."
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.240]   And your thought when people say that to you is,
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.880]   "Okay, but like, why didn't you tell me?"
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.800]   And the answer is because
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.760]   there wasn't any explicit permission given.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.920]   So in order to really find out what somebody thinks,
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.400]   you have to give them permission to say what they think.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.600]   - I saw this so much in venture capital
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.320]   that I would be in meetings with other investors
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.120]   and they'd give feedback to founders saying,
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.680]   "Oh, I think it's pretty good, but it's not a good fit."
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.960]   And then after they'd turn to me and be like,
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.960]   "God, that company's horrible, it's terrible."
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.800]   - Right. - I was like,
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.640]   "We should have just told them that."
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.360]   And I think everyone feels bad telling them that.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.840]   And now every time someone asks me for feedback
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.680]   on their startup, I'm like,
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.080]   "How honest do you want me to be?"
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.200]   Like, you want me to tell you to quit?
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.560]   So I guess if you're on the other side,
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.640]   you can also invite someone to invite you
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.880]   to be more honest and give critical feedback.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.240]   - I actually do that with my friends.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.920]   I'm like, "Are we having a conversation
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.840]   where you want advice
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.840]   or where you're just offloading your emotions?"
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.800]   'Cause I wanna know, right?
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.640]   Because sometimes they don't really want your advice.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.960]   I think that's just really important.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.920]   I think Ron Conway, who founded SV Angel,
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.320]   is such a good example of doing this really well,
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.680]   being a very good decision coach to somebody.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.800]   So he would actually tell the companies
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.760]   what he thought of them.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.480]   But he would sit down and he'd basically say,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.720]   "I think we could admit this isn't working."
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.040]   As opposed to, "Eh, it seems pretty good.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.240]   Just keep going."
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.560]   He'd be like, "Look, it's not working."
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.960]   Invariably, the founders would push back on him
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.680]   and say, "No, but I know we can turn it around."
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.720]   So it wasn't so much disagreement that it wasn't working,
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   'cause I think everybody knows
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.400]   when things aren't working very well,
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.640]   but it was always, "No, but we can turn it around."
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.240]   So he was trying to coach them into letting go.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.600]   And founders are gritty by nature.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.360]   Of course they don't wanna let go.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.200]   So when they said, "No, but I think I can turn it around,"
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.240]   his tactic was not to disagree with them,
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.000]   which I think would have just caused a rift,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.800]   but to say, "Okay, tell me exactly
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.400]   what turning it around looks like.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.960]   Let's think about the next two months.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.960]   You're saying you're gonna turn this around.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.440]   What exactly does that look like?"
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.240]   And try to figure out what those benchmarks are.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.120]   Now, he would sit down and do that with the founder
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.520]   so that the founder now owned that,
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.680]   sort of along with Ron Conway.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.880]   And this is a really good trick for decision-making,
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.960]   is that often your decision-making is at its worst
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.040]   when you're trying to make the decision right then,
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.240]   like when you're actually facing the decision down.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.520]   And this is something that really improves decision quality
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.160]   is to think in advance.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.840]   As much as possible, do advanced planning on your decisions.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.080]   It's much more efficient.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.360]   It creates much better decisions.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.680]   So that's essentially what he's doing in this moment.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.280]   He's saying, "Let's think about two months from now,
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.000]   or three months from now, the end of the next quarter.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.720]   Let's think about what this is gonna look like
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.040]   when you've turned it around."
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.160]   And then basically just set a set of benchmarks.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.360]   And then in three months, you can sit down with them
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.960]   and say, "But you haven't hit them."
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.480]   And we agreed that's what it looked like.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.480]   And that actually makes those decisions a lot cleaner.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.800]   And you can do that with your personal decisions as well.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.880]   We're all in these situations,
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.080]   like you have a relationship where it's just not going well,
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.920]   but you feel like you can turn it around.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.840]   You feel like you have so much time invested
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.200]   and you do love the person, but you're unhappy.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.240]   You can make it change.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.640]   At that moment, say,
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.040]   "How long am I willing to tolerate the status quo?"
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.200]   The way that the relationship is right now or worse.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.320]   What do I need to do, do I think,
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.760]   in order to turn this around?
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.520]   And then however long that is
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.960]   that you're willing to tolerate the status quo,
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.280]   figure out at the end of that time period,
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.240]   say it's six months, what does change look like?
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.320]   What will it look like
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.680]   when things have actually turned around here?
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.720]   You can do this for a job, a job that you're miserable in.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.640]   What do I need to do?
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.680]   What will it look like that it's actually turned around?
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.040]   What will have changed?
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.000]   And the reason that you need to do that
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.880]   is because when you're actually facing down the decision,
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.120]   that's when you're most likely
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.080]   to be rationalizing things away.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.160]   That's when your forecasts are gonna be really inaccurate.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.760]   That's when the things that you want to be true of the world
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.440]   are going to influence your actions the most.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.880]   It's when everything kind of goes to crap.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.760]   And the way that I try to put it to people
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.880]   to get them to understand this
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.920]   is that you can say all you want
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.000]   that you don't wanna eat sugar,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.800]   but when there's a cupcake right in front of you,
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.760]   it's really hard to say no.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.880]   And that's true not just of like cupcakes
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.280]   or pizza or whatever,
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.720]   you know, it's sitting right in front of you.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.640]   It's also true when you're facing a breakup
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.520]   or you're facing having to fire an employee,
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.400]   which isn't fun,
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.080]   or you're facing wanting to quit your job
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.360]   or break up with a friend or whatever.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.160]   These things are very hard to do
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.240]   because it's that moment where we're worried
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.160]   about all the time we've put into something.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.040]   It's that moment where you go from in a state of failing
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.200]   to having failed.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.760]   Because as long as you keep going,
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.840]   you might turn it around
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.960]   and not have to actually sort of put that failure
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.320]   on the books.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.480]   Like if you buy a stock and you bought it at 50
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.400]   and it goes to 30,
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.560]   as long as you hold, you could get back to 50.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.760]   - But selling now is accepting that.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.880]   - It's accepting that.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.240]   And that's really hard for us.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.880]   So that's why we want to think about both,
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.880]   how do we ask for permission for people
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.920]   to tell us the truth?
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:55.480]   How do we explicitly ask people if they want the truth?
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.280]   So we need to have both of those things going on.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.480]   And then how do we also figure out
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.160]   how the person can receive the truth?
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.200]   And that's true whether we're coaching somebody else
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.920]   or we're thinking about how we can do this for ourselves.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.040]   And one of the best ways for us to receive the truth
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.480]   is for us to think about the truth
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.240]   as something in the future.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.080]   - So in the investment example,
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.440]   this is a very common thing.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.800]   I have some stock and I know I should probably sell it now.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.320]   I wanna make sure it goes up.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.960]   In advance, obviously it would have been great
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.000]   if I had said, you know what?
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.280]   If this gets to this point, I'm gonna sell it.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.560]   And you could even go as far as to set up the order
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.960]   so that you force yourself to do it.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.600]   - Yes, you can put in a stop loss order.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.880]   - But let's say I didn't do that.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.680]   How do we get past that point?
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.040]   What can you tell someone or coach someone through it?
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.160]   - Just do it now.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.400]   - Sometimes that's hard to just do it.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.000]   - No, no, I don't mean sell it now.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.480]   Put in the order now.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.400]   But let's say I'm in the moment.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.400]   - What does it need to be trading at in a week?
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.720]   - So you're saying if you're worried now,
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.200]   then set it for a week from now.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.520]   Don't try to make the decision today.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.720]   Try to make a smaller future decision
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.720]   even though you're dealing with it in the present.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.280]   - So look, in an ideal world, you would do it right now.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.600]   And one of the ways that you can get to doing it right now
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.760]   is to ask yourself what you could do with that $30.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.760]   So this is a helpful tool.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.520]   So you bought it at 50, it's now at 30.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.040]   You don't want to sell it
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.120]   because you're worried about losing the $20.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.880]   But that $20 is already lost.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.040]   So this is something called the sunk cost fallacy.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.520]   It's not just about stocks.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.640]   It's about I'm in a job and I wanna quit,
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.840]   but what about all the time and effort I've put into the job
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.240]   and the onboarding and the training,
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.360]   and then I'll have just wasted all of that.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.360]   It's true of relationships.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.880]   It's true of employees that we've hired.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.480]   So it's basically true of everything, right?
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.120]   It's true if you buy a concert ticket,
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.280]   you've now paid for the concert ticket,
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.120]   there's planning that's gone involved.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.200]   When it's freezing cold and the driving conditions
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.080]   aren't even safe for you to go to the concert,
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.480]   you still go because you don't wanna have wasted the ticket,
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.240]   even though it's a ridiculous decision to go.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.360]   Okay, so we know that this is a problem.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.440]   So one of the things to do is to shift the frame.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.880]   And instead of saying, but I don't wanna lose my $20,
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.440]   say, what could I do with that $30?
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.960]   So that can be helpful in the moment
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.920]   because what that does is it focuses you
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.360]   on the opportunity cost of the capital
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.400]   or the opportunity cost of your time, so on and so forth.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.520]   Like, what could I use that $30 for?
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.640]   What could I use this time for?
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.640]   - That assumes that you've made the decision
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.760]   that you know you need to sell it,
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.240]   you're just struggling with it.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.200]   Let's say you work at Google
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.560]   and you have a ton of Google stock.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.880]   And I would often tell people as a financial advisor,
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.560]   I'd say, you probably don't want all of your money
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.280]   tied in the same company.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.680]   And people would say, okay, well,
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.920]   I'm trying to figure out if I should sell it.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.000]   And I would ask them, well, let's pretend there was a mistake
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.040]   and it all got sold.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.640]   Would you wanna buy it all?
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.480]   And you said in the book
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.000]   that that kind of Jedi mind trick doesn't really work.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.120]   - No. - So I'm very curious
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.960]   what we should do instead, or maybe why it doesn't work.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.080]   - There's two things that you can do instead.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.080]   One is advanced planning
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.120]   combined with a pre-commitment contract.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.200]   So essentially you wanna set up kill criteria.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.680]   What could I observe in the future
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.960]   that would make me want to sell this?
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.160]   Sometimes you'll discover,
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.280]   oh, that's the state of the world today, and you may sell.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:12.440]   But just saying like, if I were fresh to this decision,
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.440]   what would I do doesn't really help you.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.680]   So the first thing is that you can do this advanced planning.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.840]   You can set kill criteria,
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.520]   just what we've been talking about.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.480]   What are the signals that I'm gonna see in the future
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.160]   that would tell me that I should walk away?
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.920]   And this is actually gonna get you to walk away sooner.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.960]   You won't be perfect, but it will help you do it.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.240]   So if you talk about like a stop loss order, for example,
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.080]   people cancel them all the time.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.560]   But the thing is not everybody does.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.440]   And I might cancel some stop loss orders, but not others.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.320]   And that means at least I'm selling some things sooner
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.120]   than I otherwise would have.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.200]   So that's good.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.280]   So a little bit of progress goes a long way,
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.760]   but we wanna always be thinking about kill criteria.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.640]   So that's like, I'm so miserable in my job,
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.200]   but I don't wanna quit
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.680]   because maybe I have equity in it or whatever,
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.600]   but it's like the cost benefit
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.040]   doesn't look good to me right now.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.640]   What would have to happen
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.000]   over the next three months in my work
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.200]   that would tell me that I've turned things around?
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.840]   What would I see that would tell me things are still bad?
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.520]   Write that list of things down
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.560]   and commit to an action
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.680]   associated with any of those things.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.360]   I think one of the simplest examples of a kill criteria
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.720]   is when people mountain climb,
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.160]   there's something called the turnaround time.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.360]   So when you're climbing Everest,
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.680]   they have turnaround times for each day's climb.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.960]   So there's base camp one, two, three, and four.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.600]   Four is when you would actually head toward the summit,
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.160]   but you have to sort of go up and down
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.040]   in between those camps
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.200]   in order to get acclimated to the altitude.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.400]   And for any climb that you do on the day,
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.400]   including summit day, they have a turnaround time,
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.240]   which is set because they don't want you
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.800]   to descend in darkness.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.440]   So for example, on summit day,
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.000]   when you leave camp four, the turnaround time is 1 p.m.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.440]   And what that means is that
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.000]   if I'm not at a certain point at 1 p.m.,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.720]   then I must turn around.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.800]   Now, why do you set those times?
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.640]   Well, because of summit fever, right?
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.480]   Because we know that people will continue
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.320]   in very bad circumstances up to the summit,
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.920]   even when visibility is bad
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.520]   or the climbing conditions aren't good
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.640]   or there's a snowstorm,
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.760]   there's famous books written about it.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.160]   John Krakauer, "Into Thin Air,"
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.480]   talking about a year when a whole bunch of people
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.040]   got injured and like four people died
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.680]   because they just continued up to the summit.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.200]   So those turnaround times are meant
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.400]   to make it much more likely
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.720]   that you're actually gonna turn around
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.320]   when it's no longer safe to be climbing,
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.040]   knowing that when you're facing that decision down,
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.920]   you're not gonna be particularly good at it.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.600]   So that's piece number one is think in advance
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.080]   and set turnaround times for yourself, basically.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.960]   Thing number two is get a good coach.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.160]   So when you're coaching people about Google
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.640]   and their stock,
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.720]   you're giving them an outside perspective
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.880]   that's more likely to get them to do it today.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.160]   So notice they're not saying for themselves,
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.080]   "What would I do in this situation?"
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.760]   That's not really the important thing
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.240]   that's going on there.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.440]   The important thing is they're getting
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.120]   somebody's perspective who's been there, done that,
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.760]   who kind of thinks about equity,
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.280]   who's offering them a perspective that's really important,
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.560]   where they're getting advice
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.120]   that would be similar to the advice
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.040]   they would give somebody
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.080]   if they could get out of their own head.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.760]   So that is really helpful,
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.720]   is to get yourself a quitting coach,
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.760]   which is what you're saying to them there, right?
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.680]   So that's offering them that perspective
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:29.400]   that allows them also to sort of get out of the moment.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.720]   What Daniel Kahneman says, the Nobel laureate is,
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.920]   "Don't make a decision when you're in it."
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.680]   Okay, so notice both of these things
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.360]   are trying to get you to not be in it.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.120]   One is to get you to think about the future.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.040]   The other is to have somebody looking in from the outside
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.360]   'cause they're not in it,
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.600]   to see the way it looks to somebody else.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.200]   Or we could think about it a different way,
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.040]   the way it would look
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.920]   if you were standing in their shoes.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.560]   Now, the best thing to do is to combine the two,
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.360]   which is what Ron Conway does.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.040]   So he acts as a quitting coach.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.360]   He tells them, "Things aren't really working out here,
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.240]   or I think this would be a good decision."
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.120]   But when they disagree, he then turns to kill criteria
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.880]   and coaches them through that.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.000]   - Is there something to look for in a good quitting coach,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.320]   like a particular profile of a friend or a colleague?
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.960]   - Yeah, I love the way that Kahneman put it to me,
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.760]   "Find somebody who loves you,
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.640]   but doesn't care much about hurt feelings in the moment."
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.160]   So his quitting coach is Richard Thaler.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.520]   He has a Nobel Laureate for his quitting coach.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.840]   - Most people listening don't have that luxury.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.640]   - No, I don't.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.480]   But what's he saying there?
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.440]   "Find someone who loves you,
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.440]   but doesn't care much about hurt feelings in the moment."
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.640]   You need someone who really has your best interest at heart.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.760]   This is really important.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.440]   - To be clear, it's not your hype person.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.720]   It's not the person you call
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.360]   who's always pumping you up and giving you compliments.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.080]   It's almost like the exact opposite of that.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.920]   - Someone who really cares about how you do in life,
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.440]   who really is rooting for you,
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:02.120]   but isn't concerned about hurt feelings in the moment.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.360]   Because why don't we tell somebody the things that we see?
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.120]   Because we're afraid they'll be sad, right?
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.160]   Who wants to deliver the news to somebody
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.720]   when you're talking about the VCs who are like,
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.680]   "Yeah, it's pretty good.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.840]   I think you're getting there with the product market fit."
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.080]   And then the person walks out of the room
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.360]   and they're like, "That's just a dead company walking."
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.200]   Right?
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.040]   And it's like, "Oh, hold on.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.880]   Why didn't you tell them?
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.520]   Because they don't want to hurt their feelings.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.240]   They don't want to be like the Debbie Downer character
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.000]   from "SNL."
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.120]   But the problem is they're doing a tremendous amount
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.200]   of harm to those founders, right?
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:38.640]   That's the problem is we think that we're sparing them harm.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.120]   We think that we're being kind
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.680]   by not telling them the truth right now.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.240]   But what we're actually doing is harming them
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.280]   because the founders aren't getting feedback
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.200]   that they need to get, right?
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.680]   So there's all sorts of things
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.360]   that could come from that feedback.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.200]   One is they could stop.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.400]   They could return the capital to the investors.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.240]   That's a good thing.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.080]   That's capital that can be used for other opportunities
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.440]   that might be better, right?
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.480]   They can free up their time.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.040]   Anybody who's a founder is, for the most part,
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.600]   super smart, super driven, really gritty, right?
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.760]   And their time is incredibly valuable.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.600]   And if they're spending time on something
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.800]   that isn't worth that time,
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.720]   then you are doing them harm by not letting them know that,
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.360]   so they could switch and turn their attention
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.040]   to something better,
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.760]   something more worth their time and their brainpower.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.640]   And then the other thing is that it's a real disservice
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.640]   to their employees
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.600]   because the people who are working at a startup
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.200]   are generally working for very low cash comp,
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.600]   but lots of equity.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.800]   So once you determine that the equity isn't worth their time,
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.080]   you ought to free them up.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.480]   And what's interesting is that founders will often say,
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.160]   "I owe it to my employees to keep going."
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.480]   And it's like, no, but once you've decided
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.040]   that the equity isn't worth their time,
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.720]   you owe it to them to let them go
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.040]   so that they can go spend their time on something
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.680]   that might actually be world-changing,
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.320]   where the equity might really matter.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.640]   'Cause there's only two reasons
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.960]   that people are willing to do this
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.280]   because they wanna change the world
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.920]   or they think the equity is gonna be worth a lot, or both.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.800]   So once you've figured out
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.960]   that none of those things are true, let them go.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.640]   So when the VC is trying to spare their feelings,
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.400]   look at all the harm that's coming from that.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.680]   You're allowing someone to be a dead company walking
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.640]   for however long until they can't raise another round.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.640]   That's months and months, sometimes years,
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.800]   that you're trapping people in a losing endeavor
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.440]   when you see something else.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.800]   And so when you're looking for a quitting coach,
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.920]   this has to do with, first of all, that permission giving.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.600]   You have to be clear with the person
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.000]   that you want to hear the truth.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.160]   And then you need to go find someone
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.000]   who really has your long-term best interest at heart,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.120]   is willing to say the hard things to you
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.400]   because they love you.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.800]   - I have a few people like that, for some decisions.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.560]   And then for others, it's a little tough.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.480]   If you wanna keep learning from the world's best minds,
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.920]   anytime, anywhere, and at your own pace,
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.120]   you have to check out MasterClass,
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.840]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.360]   With over a hundred classes
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.560]   from a range of world-class instructors
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.120]   like Steph Curry, Richard Branson, and Martin Scorsese,
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.120]   that thing you've always wanted to do
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.080]   is way closer than you think.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.520]   When I signed up a few years ago,
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.080]   I jumped straight into an amazing cooking class
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.920]   by Thomas Keller that has totally leveled up my skills
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.840]   in the kitchen.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.640]   I also really enjoyed FBI hostage negotiator,
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.440]   Chris Voss's class on the art of negotiation.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.080]   And with every class I've taken,
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.080]   I'm blown away by the depth of knowledge
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.280]   the instructors have and the quality of the experience.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.840]   And a MasterClass membership makes such a good gift
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.560]   for someone that's hard to shop for.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.120]   I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.560]   Get unlimited access to every MasterClass.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.920]   And as an All The Hacks listener,
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.480]   you get 15% off an annual membership.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.680]   Go to allthehacks.com/masterclass.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:02.680]   That's allthehacks.com/masterclass for 15% off MasterClass.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:07.880]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.720]   I get it.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.420]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.320]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.380]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.320]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.280]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.200]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.000]   take care of the supplies.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.800]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.640]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.060]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.040]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.520]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.600]   that you got through another week.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.680]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.240]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.000]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.080]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.760]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.320]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.300]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.340]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.160]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.240]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.880]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.360]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.000]   So, whatever the occasion,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.280]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:14.300]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.520]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.440]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.920]   and supporting the show.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.760]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.240]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.780]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.960]   So, please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.880]   I briefly wanna go back in time
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.520]   to talk about base rates for a second,
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.360]   'cause I just thought it was-
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.440]   - Okay, 'cause I love base rates.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.280]   It's like my favorite topic, for real.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.520]   - When I think about base rates,
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.200]   it reminds me of the whole premise of thinking in bets,
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.440]   which really brought to life
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.160]   the idea of asking someone to want to bet.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.400]   We think of these beliefs,
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.320]   we have these ideas that we think are so certain
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.160]   and we're so confident,
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.800]   I'm gonna hire someone, they're gonna be the best,
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.540]   is really just thinking about everything in life as a bet
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:04.560]   and challenging yourself to put certainties around things,
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.080]   even mundane, silly decisions.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.220]   The best way to rewire how this all works in your head?
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:11.840]   - Oh, I think so, absolutely.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:12.720]   So, here's the thing.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.680]   When I say, "Do you want to bet?"
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.520]   All I'm doing is making you examine the assumptions
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.800]   that are going into your statement.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.920]   Listen, I know this person's gonna work out.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.240]   I'm like 90% sure.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.080]   Do you want to bet?
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.480]   - One for my wife and I is always
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.640]   just like remembering something.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.720]   I'm like, I'm totally sure that our daughter's preschool
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.880]   is starting next week.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.720]   - Do you want to bet?
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.240]   - My wife didn't ask that, but if she had,
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.280]   I would've been like, "Oh, I don't know if I wanna put
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.360]   all my money on the line."
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.820]   - Because what it makes you think about is,
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.660]   there's a couple things.
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.480]   Well, what does the person who's betting me
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.520]   know that I don't know?
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.160]   So, in some sense, when I say, "Want to bet?"
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.720]   I'm acting a little bit as a coach to you.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.720]   'Cause I'm telling you that I have a perspective
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.800]   that is different from yours.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.380]   If I'm willing to bet, that means that I'm saying
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.240]   that I believe something different than you.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.800]   So, it's automatically making you start to think like,
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.600]   "Well, what's a different way to look at this?"
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.360]   And then you have to start examining like,
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.360]   "Well, exactly how sure am I of this?"
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.360]   My husband and I talk like this all the time.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.980]   Generally, where it's like, "Well, what's the price?"
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:09.860]   That's what we end up doing,
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.820]   which is just a way to say, "What's the probability?"
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:15.060]   We don't think about bets as just dollar for dollar.
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.660]   Let's say that it's an election.
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.660]   I live in Pennsylvania.
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.560]   So, let's say you say like, "I'm sure John Fetterman's
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.480]   gonna win the election."
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.760]   And someone says, "Want to bet?"
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.000]   You could immediately say, "Yes."
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.260]   But then the response would be, "Well, what's the price?
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.660]   Are you willing to lay me a price?
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:28.980]   Are you giving me a price?"
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.400]   As an example, if I say to you,
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.620]   "I'll bet $10 for every dollar that you bet,"
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.820]   I'm telling you that I'm very certain that I'm right.
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.380]   'Cause I'm risking a lot compared to what I can win.
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.060]   But if I say, "No, no, no, no, no."
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.940]   If I say I'm 90% sure of something,
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:45.860]   I should be willing to lay you nine to one.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.360]   $9 for every one.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.780]   But as soon as I'm like, "Okay, I'll take the nine to one."
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.060]   And I go, "Wait, no.
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.100]   No, no, no, no."
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.420]   Like even money.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.920]   Then what I'm saying is actually, I think it's 50/50.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.580]   And I wasn't really thinking about it.
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:03.180]   It's like a good way to be like interacting.
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.280]   I can tell you that I do this with little things
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.780]   and big things and whatever.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.060]   It's actually kind of fun.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.340]   Once you start like, "Well, what price do you wanna lay?"
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.060]   And we always bet a dollar.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.620]   And it's really fun.
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:16.060]   But I think that the thing that's really important
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.580]   about the betting,
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.700]   and this is so crucial to good decision-making,
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.860]   is that it forces you to make the things
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:28.000]   that are implicit in the decision you're making explicit.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.560]   The simplest example is one of the things
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.560]   that is always implicit in the decision you're making
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.680]   is your forecast of the probability
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.640]   of different things occurring.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.340]   In other words, whether you know it or not,
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:46.340]   base rates are part of the decision-making.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.160]   So when I say to you,
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.880]   "I'm gonna meet you for dinner at seven o'clock.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.160]   And I promise I'll be on time."
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.000]   And you say, "Wanna bet?"
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.640]   Implied in that is that I must have a tendency to be late.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.480]   And the question is,
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.400]   "How much of a tendency do I have to be late?
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.200]   And how willing am I to say to you,
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.600]   "Yes, I'll bet you that I'm gonna be on time."
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.960]   When I say things like that and then you bet back,
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.720]   those are all things that have to do with base rates.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.880]   You could say something like,
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.180]   "I know the stock market is gonna go up this year."
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:21.800]   Well, that's a prediction of the future.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.600]   And if I know the base rates, I may bet you on that.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.520]   Depending on what you're willing to lay me, right?
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.200]   'Cause the stock market goes up actually somewhere
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.840]   between like, it depends on how you measure it,
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.880]   65 and 75% of the years, it will go up.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.320]   So if you say, "I'm 100% sure it's gonna go up this year."
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.360]   I might bet you.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.400]   - And I would take that bet
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.160]   because there are actually options out there I could use
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.520]   to arbitrage your confidence.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.960]   - That is true.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.200]   That is very true.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.920]   But I'm not involved in the arbitrage.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.160]   So you can hedge away.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.040]   I'm just gonna take my bet.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.760]   And then maybe I'll hedge it as well.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.560]   But the point being that when somebody says, "Wanna bet?"
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:00.120]   It's like, when you say, "I think this person I'm gonna hire
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.760]   "is gonna work out 90% of the time and I bet you."
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.660]   It makes you actually go through and start thinking,
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.560]   "Well, wait a minute, why do I believe that?"
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.360]   You know, remember one of the things that we wanna do
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.500]   in order to improve decision-making
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.240]   is to start thinking about what's the quality
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.180]   of the beliefs that we have
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.640]   that go into any decision that we're making.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.720]   And part of that is making the implicit explicit.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.040]   And this is one of the things
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.480]   that's so incredibly important.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.480]   I mean, even talking about a hiring example
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.120]   where you send out to a bunch of people,
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.320]   what do you think the job description should be?
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.000]   What do you think the person,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.160]   if you were describing them to a recruiter,
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.920]   and you're getting that all independently,
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.840]   what you're finding out is in an explicit way,
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.300]   when they would otherwise just go and interview somebody,
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.260]   what are the things that they think are important
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.440]   for filling this role?
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.400]   And now you've made that explicit in a way
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.080]   that you can, first of all, examine it,
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.400]   which is incredibly important, right?
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.500]   We have to be able to examine our decisions.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:57.880]   And that means that we have to actually make all this stuff
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.700]   that's sort of in our gut explicit in a way
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.280]   where you can examine it like an object.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.620]   You can walk around it, you can have discussions about it.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.760]   I can see that you have a different perspective.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.720]   And when we see that we have a dispersion of opinion,
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.120]   we can sort of dive into that dispersion
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.320]   to see where the gaps are,
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.280]   to see why you believe something different
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.880]   about the world than I do.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.480]   And this is the way that we start to learn really fast.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.020]   It's the way that we start to get our decisions
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.480]   to be much more accurate.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.840]   But there's a side effect of making things explicit,
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.160]   which is that it allows us to close feedback loops
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.520]   a lot better.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.400]   So now, when we do actually start
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.120]   to get some sort of set of outcomes,
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.780]   when we see an outcome, we can actually now go back
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.780]   and say, what did I believe at the time
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.960]   when I made this decision?
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.480]   And we can understand, here were my beliefs at the time,
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.680]   here's what I found out after the fact, right?
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.640]   Let me go back and figure out,
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.640]   did I already have these outcomes
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.520]   in my set of possibilities?
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.920]   Do I feel like I had the probabilities right
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.160]   that those were gonna occur?
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.240]   Was there stuff that I learned after the fact
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.900]   that I didn't know beforehand?
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.160]   Could I have known it beforehand?
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.440]   Could I know it going forward?
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.420]   As an example, if I'm just thinking about
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.480]   when should I leave for work?
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.980]   I wouldn't write this down
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.080]   'cause it's a more mundane decision,
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.240]   but I'm actually explicitly thinking about
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.160]   when should I leave for work?
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.200]   How long do I think it's gonna take for me to be here?
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.100]   How bad is it if I'm late?
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:29.200]   And I decide in an explicit way,
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.880]   it's not very bad if I'm late today.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.840]   I don't really have any important meetings
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.660]   for the first like hour and a half of the morning.
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.580]   So I've got a little bit of leeway.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.200]   So I'm really gonna leave
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.960]   according to what the average time it is
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.680]   for me to get to work.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.960]   So now I go and there's some huge accident on the highway
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.720]   and I ended up being like 45 minutes late to work, okay?
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.460]   So do we look back on that and say that was a mistake?
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.200]   Which is what we have a tendency to do.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.800]   Do we look back and say that was so stupid?
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.260]   Why did I leave so late?
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:00.380]   Well, in this particular case,
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.560]   it wouldn't make sense to do that
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.940]   because you took it into account.
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.680]   You sort of knew there's some possibility
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.020]   of bad things happening on the road.
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.240]   You don't really have control over
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.860]   whether there's an accident on the road or not.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.320]   And you had a lot of leeway
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:15.440]   because it wasn't a big deal if you were late that morning.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.220]   So you took all of that into account
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.440]   and then a bad thing happened,
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.880]   but that doesn't mean that the decision
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.000]   was bad to take that risk on.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.780]   Whereas if I'm deciding to leave for the airport,
[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:29.120]   I may say, well, I can't miss my flight.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.240]   This is the only flight that they have today
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.440]   to the location I'm going.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.120]   So now you may leave a lot of time
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:38.720]   for just that type of thing like bad traffic or an accident.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.760]   So what are you sacrificing for that?
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.520]   Well, you may end up spending an extra hour
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.000]   hanging out in the airport,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.100]   but you make sure that you get to your plane on time.
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.360]   Now, just as in the reverse case,
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:52.780]   when there is no traffic and the roads are totally clear
[00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:54.560]   and you get to the airport an hour early
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.460]   and you find yourself sitting around bored
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:59.000]   in an airport lounge,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.880]   you also shouldn't think it was a mistake.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.160]   Because in an explicit way,
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.320]   you thought about what your risk tolerance was.
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.920]   You thought about the base rates,
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.440]   how long it could take you to get to work.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.840]   And you took that all into account
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.800]   when you made the decision.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.400]   And this is what we need ultimately
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.600]   in order to be good decision makers.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.020]   - If you think about in advance,
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.100]   the likelihood of the outcome happening,
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:23.880]   that makes it much easier to reflect on it.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.240]   This happened to me in a situation,
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.440]   I won't go into the details of it
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.520]   'cause it could go down a rabbit hole,
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.480]   but we were trying to do something tax efficiently
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.420]   when we were buying a home
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.720]   and it involved taking some money out of the market.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.560]   And I was like, okay,
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.720]   we're gonna have to take a good chunk of our investments
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:40.440]   out of the market for about 60 days.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:43.720]   And data showed about what the return on average
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:44.960]   is for 60 days.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.880]   And so we knew about what we thought
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.960]   we would lose out in those 60 days.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.680]   And we knew the upside of going through this entire process
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.720]   to buy the house in this specific way.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.920]   And the only X factor was that in those 60 days
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.560]   was our last presidential election.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.520]   So we were like, oh, we were a little anxious about this,
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.560]   this thing that could really move the markets.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:04.600]   At the end of the day,
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.400]   I think time will tell if we stay in this house
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.680]   for more than like seven years, it was a good decision.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.680]   But if we don't, I still think it was a good decision.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.240]   And even the wording I just used is probably wrong.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.160]   If we stay in this house for seven years,
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.800]   it will have been the optimal outcome.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:22.320]   But no matter what, it was the right decision.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.280]   And I just have to keep harping on myself
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:25.640]   when people say, oh, is that a bummer?
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.680]   You know, you might've lost out.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.760]   It's like, well, I made the best decision
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.680]   with the information I had at the time.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.000]   And I can feel good about that as hard as it is.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:33.880]   - I don't know if you have any tips
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.200]   for getting over that emotional angst of like,
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.080]   it's really easy to know you made the right decision,
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.200]   but if the right decision made you lose money,
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.160]   it's still hard to deal with that.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.320]   - The other thing is I assume
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.440]   that you took that into account.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.280]   There are base rates
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:48.040]   for how long people stay in their homes as well, right?
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.560]   So you can say like, in the worst case scenario,
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.360]   this is how long we would have to be in the house.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.720]   What do we think the probability is
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.200]   that we'd be in the house this long?
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.400]   In the best case scenario, this is how long we,
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.080]   you know, so you take all of that into account.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.700]   One of the things that I do, again,
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.160]   is to always change the frame.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.040]   Well, how would I feel if it had worked out?
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.720]   I guess in the last presidential election,
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.620]   there's other factors, but just from a financial standpoint,
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.500]   how would I feel if it worked out?
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:13.920]   One of the things that I always try to think about is,
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.040]   oh, but those things go my way a lot too.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.960]   I'll take a really simple example
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.240]   where I play tennis a lot
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.680]   and a ball hits the net court a lot.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.720]   And sometimes it plops over to the other side of the court.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.560]   And sometimes it plops over to your side of the court.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:35.320]   And this can be on very big points that this happens.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:38.000]   And when it plops back over to your side of the court,
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.580]   you're super sad and you feel like you're really unlucky.
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:43.880]   But then what I say to myself is,
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.280]   but it's gone the other way for me
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.500]   at really important times as well.
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.400]   So I try to always remember that.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.560]   And the question then I try to focus on is,
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.680]   did I pick the right shot?
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.360]   Should I have done something
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.920]   which was gonna have more clearance over the net?
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.880]   Then I start to think about, was it the right choice?
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.200]   I try to get back to the decision itself
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.200]   as opposed to just the outcome.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.200]   And we do this all the time.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.400]   You're talking about a pretty high stakes decision
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.440]   that has to do with financial planning in-house,
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.840]   but you're taking equal risk by taking it out of the market.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.800]   And the thing is that you weren't taking it out of the market
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.720]   because you were guessing the outcome
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.260]   of the presidential election.
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.800]   Now that I would say, that's not so smart.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.480]   We just know that from the base rates,
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.680]   trying to time the market doesn't really work out
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.020]   for people very much.
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.040]   But you're taking it out for a different reason
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.680]   where you understand what the risks are,
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.600]   that sometimes it's gonna go up,
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.260]   sometimes it's gonna go down.
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:38.920]   You understand how long you would have to stay in your house
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.500]   in order for it to be a reasonable decision,
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:42.840]   so on and so forth.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.000]   And you decided that you were willing to take on that risk.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.520]   I don't have any issues with that.
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.660]   Now that's not to say
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:50.280]   that you wouldn't close the feedback loop
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.880]   and go back and say, would it have made more sense
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:58.280]   for us to wait until the presidential election
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.720]   had played out?
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.420]   And the answer to that might've been,
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.460]   but this is the house that we really want.
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:05.700]   We've been looking for a long time
[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:08.340]   and it's kind of go time, we can't wait.
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.420]   Okay, none of that sounds bad.
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:12.820]   The only thing that would be bad
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:15.220]   is I had lots and lots and lots of time to wait
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:16.540]   and I didn't need to do this
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:18.780]   at a moment of high uncertainty.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:19.620]   Then I would say, well,
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:21.460]   maybe we should talk about that issue.
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:24.480]   Outside of that, you've thought it through,
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.320]   but this tendency, like when you said
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.200]   then it will have been a mistake,
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.440]   been a bad decision, it's so strong with us.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.440]   Let me ask you this.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.160]   So you've gone to a restaurant, right?
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:35.000]   - Yes.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.440]   - And you're looking at the menu
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:40.220]   and you're trying to figure out what to order.
[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:42.760]   Let's say it's a restaurant you've never been to.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.480]   So this is really high uncertainty, right?
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.320]   Like you've never been to this restaurant.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.320]   Yeah, it's got good Yelp reviews
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.160]   and you're trying to figure out what to order
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.420]   when you narrow it down to a couple of dishes.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.820]   And then at some point, you know, you just got to order.
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:58.860]   And so you do and you get the food and it's disgusting.
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.700]   It's like yucky.
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.200]   What do you immediately say to yourself?
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:03.660]   Like, oh, I made such a big mistake.
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:05.400]   I should have ordered something else.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.400]   - Yep.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.480]   - What do you mean you should have ordered something else?
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.220]   Like you kind of know what your preferences are.
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:11.180]   You know what you like.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.780]   So what I try to tell people is look,
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:14.620]   you know what you know,
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:15.820]   there's a whole bunch of stuff you don't know
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.120]   and then there's a lot of left.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:19.920]   So even with something like ordering off a menu,
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:21.780]   I say, just look, here's the deal.
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:24.620]   You should just divide the menu up into stuff you like
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:26.300]   and stuff you don't like.
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:27.900]   It's easy for me, I'm a vegan.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:29.900]   So it's like, what's vegan, what's not vegan?
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.400]   And so I can divide it up that way.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.940]   And then I could do further things
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:34.900]   like what has eggplant in it?
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:35.900]   And then do that.
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.540]   And then, you know, I get it narrowed down
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:40.000]   to whatever is available for me to eat off the menu.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.100]   And then honestly, you should flip a coin.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:45.980]   Like literally just, okay,
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:49.480]   here's the things that are in my choice set.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.360]   I'm just gonna flip a coin to try to figure it out.
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.280]   Now, if you're not comfortable doing that,
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.220]   I'll do this sometimes.
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:57.960]   I'll just say to the waiter, you decide.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.960]   It's the same thing as flipping a coin.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.060]   Here are these two things, surprise me.
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:03.860]   - I did an episode with Patrick McGinnis,
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.460]   who's notable for coining the term FOMO.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.840]   And he just looks at his watch.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:08.960]   He comes up with two things.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:11.140]   He says, if the second hand's on the left, it's this.
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:12.280]   If it's on the right, it's this.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.380]   It's his version of flipping a coin.
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:16.400]   - Yeah, or you can just tell the wait person
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.840]   to just decide for you.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.940]   And then you get what you get and it's fine.
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:23.240]   But that strategy, so I call it the menu strategy,
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.140]   is actually a way to make your whole life
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.640]   much more efficient.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.720]   It's like, you're trying to decide what to watch on TV.
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.060]   Figure out what your choice set is and flip a coin.
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.860]   The key to doing that is that
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:35.300]   when you don't like the thing you're watching, quit it.
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:37.300]   This is the thing about this type of strategy.
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.160]   You have to be willing to abandon it.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:42.060]   The problem is that when we're approaching a decision,
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.000]   should we start this series?
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.900]   We think we have to finish the series.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.540]   We think we have to finish an episode.
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:51.900]   Right, like we think all of these weird things about it.
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.380]   And so then we get really caught up
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:54.640]   in trying to do research.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.940]   I just look at Rotten Tomatoes
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:58.140]   and look at the things that are high rated
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.140]   or things that my friends have recommended.
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:01.220]   And then I just do it.
[00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:02.720]   And if I don't like it, I stop.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.260]   But you have to be able to do the thing
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.580]   on the back end in order to do it.
[00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:07.520]   But you can do this with everything.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.160]   There's two houses that you love
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.560]   and you can't decide between them.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.800]   Okay, if you can't decide between them,
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.000]   by definition, that means that your forecast
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.300]   of the probability of you loving either one
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.260]   and being happy in them is equal.
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:20.440]   So flip a coin.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.840]   I mean, you can really do it with big decisions.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.600]   The difference between a big decision and a small decision
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:31.180]   is that the bar for sorting out options
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:34.820]   you would consider versus options you wouldn't is higher.
[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:37.320]   For what you'd order off a menu, it's not that big a deal.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:41.160]   You eat three meals a day, I assume, whatever.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.120]   It's a very low bar for getting to a coin flip.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.120]   For buying a house, it's a pretty high bar
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:48.000]   for getting to a coin flip.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.720]   And that's all that you need to think about
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:51.400]   is what's the threshold.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.440]   That's it.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.260]   - I love this idea.
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:55.000]   I have an example I've mentioned in the past
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.160]   of we were going to Greece and we found three hotels
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.000]   and they were all pretty similar and we were struggling.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.400]   We were like, well, does this room look nice in this room?
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.080]   - Yeah, and it turns into months.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.380]   - And the easy answer was like,
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:06.680]   once you've gotten to a point
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.880]   that you're pretty sure all of them would be fine,
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.160]   just pick one and move on.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.480]   But it brings up the bigger question,
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.680]   which is you've written a couple of books
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.580]   on decision-making and then you decided
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:17.840]   that this one decision of quitting and walking away
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:19.200]   was different enough, I assume,
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.160]   that you wrote an entire another book on it
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:22.440]   that just came out.
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:26.160]   I'm curious what made quitting such a hard decision?
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.720]   What characterized it so differently
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:30.120]   that it was worth the follow-up to dig into?
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:31.160]   - Here's the deal.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:33.920]   What allows us to make decisions under uncertainty
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.040]   is that we have the option to quit.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.480]   Okay, so just basic, right?
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.800]   Imagine if when you hired someone,
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.360]   you could never fire them.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.840]   How hard of a decision that would be.
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:50.600]   Imagine if as soon as you went on a date with somebody,
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.000]   you had to marry them.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.720]   How hard would it be to choose somebody
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.720]   to go on a date with?
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:59.120]   Imagine if you rented an apartment,
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:02.500]   you couldn't get out of the lease, like ever.
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:05.160]   Like these things would become very difficult.
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.400]   So decision-making under uncertainty is really hard,
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.400]   but what allows us to be able to do it,
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.320]   to be able to choose things when we know so little,
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:16.480]   is that when we find out new stuff,
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.080]   whether it's about the world
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.880]   or it's about our own preferences,
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.880]   oh, it turns out I don't like this neighborhood,
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:23.920]   whatever, that we can quit.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.360]   So it's a really, really, really important decision.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.400]   Having this option to quit is incredibly valuable.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.940]   But what's interesting is that what the science tells us
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:35.580]   is that we're really bad at it.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:38.840]   Obviously, grit is a really, really popular concept.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.720]   People think about grit as character-building,
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:46.480]   in fact, as almost synonymous with character.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:49.120]   And it's true that grit's really important
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:51.440]   for getting you to stick to hard things that are worthwhile.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:53.340]   That's incredibly important, right?
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:56.200]   We have to not quit things just 'cause they're hard.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.400]   Otherwise, we won't ever be successful at anything,
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.340]   'cause anything worth doing is gonna be hard at some point.
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.240]   So that's for sure true.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.080]   And I think everybody should read "Grit,"
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:08.340]   and it's a great book, and Angela Duckworth is brilliant.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:11.960]   But I was missing the other side of the conversation,
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.640]   which is that grit also gets you to stick to hard things
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.880]   that are not worthwhile.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.240]   And that's a really huge problem.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.800]   We can't think about grit as a virtue
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.440]   and quitting as a vice or a character flaw.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.080]   I can show you lots of circumstances
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.700]   where grit is character flaw,
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:30.280]   where sticking to something too long is bad,
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.600]   like Muhammad Ali boxing for years
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:37.160]   after he already had symptoms of Parkinson's,
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.000]   when he was really suffering physically,
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.840]   he should have walked away from the game.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.240]   So we know that it's very context-dependent,
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.840]   and sometimes quitting is the best thing
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.280]   that you can ever do.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.960]   Like if you're in a job with a toxic boss,
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.120]   or you're in a toxic relationship,
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.080]   or you're at the top of Everest,
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.620]   and it's past the turnaround time,
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.500]   and there's a snowstorm coming in,
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:01.680]   clearly sticking to it is dumb in that situation.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.280]   So we need to realize that they're the same decision,
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.400]   and one is not good and one is not bad.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.200]   It's very dependent on context.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.320]   And then when you start to look and dive
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.040]   into the scientific literature,
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:18.240]   it turns out that there's just tremendous cognitive forces
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.840]   that make it very hard for us to walk away from things,
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.800]   not at the right time anyway.
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.000]   All the way from sunk costs,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.200]   which we've talked about a little,
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.240]   which is this tendency to stick to things
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.660]   because you're worried you'll have wasted the time
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:32.880]   or the money or whatever that you put into it,
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.120]   because you wanna get that back.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.080]   Somehow, like when you hold onto a stock
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.720]   or you stay in a job or whatever,
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.840]   there's issues that have to do
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.680]   with endowment ownership over things.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.880]   We value the things that we own
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.980]   more than the things that we don't,
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:48.760]   including our beliefs, by the way.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.300]   And we don't like to let go of those things
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:54.400]   that have to do with something called sure loss aversion,
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.960]   which Daniel Kahneman talks about,
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:00.600]   which is if you quit, it turns into a realized loss.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.120]   And we don't like that.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.080]   That doesn't feel good to us.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.800]   As Richard Thaler says,
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.400]   we don't like to close mental accounts in the losses,
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.280]   so we don't like to close those accounts
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.000]   and sort of eat that loss.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   Even though, obviously, just like a stock portfolio,
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.680]   our decisions are a portfolio,
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.880]   our opportunities are a portfolio,
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.600]   and we ought to be trying to spend our time
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.320]   on the ones that are going to move us
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.960]   toward our goals the most,
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.680]   that are gonna cause us to gain the most ground.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:34.240]   We open an account for a particular thing we're doing,
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.360]   whether it's a marathon, or climbing Everest,
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.780]   or a job, or a relationship, or whatever,
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.400]   and we don't think about that time, that effort,
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.680]   that all of that is fungible
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.480]   across all the possible opportunities we have.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.200]   Instead, we just think if I quit now,
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.480]   I won't have hit my goal,
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.360]   and then I'm gonna be a failure,
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.360]   and I'm gonna have lost, and so we won't quit.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.680]   There's identity, cognitive dissonance, status quo bias.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.000]   These are all in the book.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.600]   Omission, commission bias.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.800]   There's so much stuff that we just carry around with us,
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.120]   this cognitive debris that makes it really hard
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.800]   for us to walk away,
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.760]   and here's the thing why I'm so passionate about this topic,
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.520]   is that we think that quitting will slow our progress down.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.480]   We think it may actually cause us to lose ground,
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.880]   but that's not true.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:24.000]   When you quit at the right time,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.100]   it actually gets you to where you want to go faster,
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:29.040]   because it stops you from sticking to something
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.040]   that isn't actually causing you
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.080]   to gain ground toward your goal,
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.560]   and allows you to switch to something
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:39.200]   that will allow you to gain ground toward your goal,
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.200]   and that's the thing that we miss,
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.400]   because we don't see the other opportunities
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.480]   that the thing we're doing is stopping us from engaging in,
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.280]   because there's a cost to that time.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.040]   There's a cost to that money that we're spending
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.080]   on whatever it is that we're into,
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.280]   or that we're pursuing, the path that we're on,
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.040]   and we won't let go of it,
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.520]   because if we haven't reached our goal,
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.860]   we think we're a failure,
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:05.360]   but just like if you sell that stock at 30,
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.440]   and you lost the $20, so what?
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.720]   You can put that $30 into other investments
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:10.880]   that are actually gonna get you
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.180]   to financial well-being more quickly,
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:17.120]   so holding on to a stock that isn't worthwhile,
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.640]   because you already lost $20 in it,
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.880]   is actually slowing your progress down,
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.580]   because you can't go put those resources
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:24.640]   into something that will get you
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.400]   to financial well-being more quickly,
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.040]   and that's true whether it's a stock,
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.800]   or a job, or a relationship, or a race you're running.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.760]   I don't really care.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.200]   If the world tells you you should quit,
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.560]   you ought to do that,
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.320]   because that's the thing that allows us
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.280]   to decide under uncertainty in the first place,
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.860]   so let's start exercising that option,
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:44.200]   so that we can more efficiently and more quickly
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.240]   get to where we wanna go.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.160]   - I love the Astro Teller example
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.000]   of the monkey and the pedestal.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.160]   Can you just walk people through that?
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.720]   - We wanna be efficient in the things that we're pursuing,
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.800]   so we want to get to understand should we continue,
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.280]   or should we quit as quickly as possible,
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.860]   so here's a mental model that will help people do that.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.760]   It's called Monkeys and Pedestals,
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.600]   from Astro Teller, as you said, over at X at Google.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   Imagine you're trying to train a monkey
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.760]   to juggle flaming torches
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:13.240]   while standing on a pedestal in a town square.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.120]   This will be a money-making opportunity.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.740]   What's the thing that you should do first?
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:18.120]   Should you build the pedestal first,
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.480]   or should you try to train the monkey
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.280]   to juggle the flaming torches?
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.640]   Well, the thing about the pedestal building
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.520]   is that we've been building pedestals forever.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.640]   It doesn't really help you.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.760]   It's low-hanging fruit,
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.840]   but it's not something that's actually gonna help you
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.400]   to accomplish your goal,
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.760]   'cause you could just turn a milk crate upside down, even.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.940]   So if you spend time building the pedestal,
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.660]   it's really kind of wasted time,
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:41.420]   because it's not unlocking the bottleneck in the system,
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.040]   which is can I actually train this monkey
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.880]   to juggle the flaming torches?
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.720]   So his point is that when you approach this project,
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.920]   you should say what are the monkeys, right,
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.920]   and ask yourself this.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:51.760]   What are the monkeys?
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.580]   What are the pedestals?
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.000]   What are the things I know I can accomplish?
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.440]   What are the things that are gonna unlock the whole system,
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.600]   but are really hard, and I don't know if we can do it?
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:02.280]   And attack those things you don't know first,
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.000]   and that's gonna do two really important things for you.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   One, it's gonna get you to understand
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.360]   whether you can actually do this thing or not
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.880]   really quickly, right?
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.560]   Two, and this is really important,
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.080]   is it's gonna reduce those sunk costs,
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.080]   because all that time you spend building pedestals
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.900]   is time and effort and money
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.660]   that you're putting into something
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.760]   that's then gonna cause friction
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.060]   when you butt up against a monkey that's hard to train.
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.080]   So train the monkey first.
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.680]   Now, this is the opposite of the way
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.820]   that most people do things.
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:35.580]   How many times have people approached a project
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:38.260]   and said, well, what's the low-hanging fruit?
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.100]   Let's try to solve for that.
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:41.700]   And the problem with the low-hanging fruit
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.340]   is that those are all pedestals.
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:44.620]   Don't do the low-hanging fruit
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.020]   until you know whether you can actually grow the whole tree.
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.140]   Can you get to the fruit at the top of the tree?
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.520]   That's what you really care about.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.040]   So I love that mental model.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.200]   - I'm gonna link in the show notes.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.600]   A friend of mine, Aaron Battalion,
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.920]   wrote this post about knowns and unknowns.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.680]   He pushed me so hard in my last startup.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.280]   He was like, figure out what that known unknown is.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.420]   What's the thing that you don't know how to do
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:04.880]   that you know you don't know how to do?
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.900]   In his case, ultimately,
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.220]   the thing that he pushed me to focus on that,
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:11.600]   sorry, Aaron, I didn't follow at the beginning,
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.840]   was the thing that we realized
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.240]   halfway through running the company was the problem.
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.100]   And we ended up shutting the company down
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.680]   with $4 million in the bank
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.000]   because we realized the thing wasn't going to work
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.200]   and we didn't wanna keep going.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.240]   - And you probably could have done that
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.400]   with $5 million in the bank.
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.440]   What AstroTeller's trying to say is like,
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.080]   look, you're gonna spend some time
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.560]   trying to solve for the monkey
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.100]   or figure out if you can solve the monkey or monkeys.
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.540]   And you might spend $2 million doing that.
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:39.600]   But if you can get to that answer in $2 million
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.920]   instead of $9 million,
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.520]   again, that's a savings of $7 million,
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.120]   not a waste of $2 million.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.160]   That's why this is such an important mental model
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.120]   for people to use.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.200]   There were a bunch of other great mental models
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.600]   on all kinds of different aspects of quitting.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:55.000]   Where can people find out more about the book
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.160]   and everything else you're working on?
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.240]   - Well, people can always go to AnnieDuke.com.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.560]   I have a newsletter.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.280]   Lately, it's been a lot about quitting, not surprisingly.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.680]   I'm super into the topic, as you can imagine,
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.640]   or you can tell.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.840]   And then Twitter @AnnieDuke.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.640]   And then you can obviously buy the book
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:15.680]   at any online or physical retailer near you.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.880]   - I got an advanced copy, I appreciate that.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.960]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.520]   Sometimes I don't get through the whole book
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.440]   before I talk to someone.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.440]   This time I was like staying up late.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:25.360]   My wife's like, "We gotta wake up our kids in the morning."
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.960]   So I really enjoyed it.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.320]   Thank you so much for writing it.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.800]   And thanks so much for being here.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.520]   - Thank you so much for having me.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.960]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.760]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.240]   If you haven't already left a rating
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:41.640]   and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.360]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.800]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.180]   questions for me, or just wanna say hi,
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:51.440]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.520]   That's it for this week.
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:53.720]   I'll see you next week.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.480]   (bubbles popping)
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.320]   (bubbles popping)
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.160]   (bubbles popping)
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.220]   you
