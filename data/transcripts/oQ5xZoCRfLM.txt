[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:14.380]   the Gospel according to St. John, in the first chapter, in verses 12 and 13, verses 12 and
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.520]   13, in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:30.080]   "But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.640]   them that believe on His name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.520]   flesh, nor of the will of men, but of God."
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.160]   Now the point at which we've reached and arrived in our consideration of this great
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.720]   statement is this, we are told there that the central object, in a sense, of the Incarnation,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.440]   the coming of the Son of God into the world, with which this prologue of John's Gospel
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.560]   deals, was that those who believe on Him might have the right and the authority and the power
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.680]   to become the sons of God.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.960]   We've considered how that happens, and now we're at this point.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.120]   The most important thing, obviously, in life is that we should know that this is true of
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.400]   us.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.800]   This is the greatest thing that's ever happened or ever can happen, that God has sent His
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.640]   only Son into the world.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.680]   It's a unique event.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.280]   All that happened in Him is unique.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.080]   And its design and object was, I say, that those who believe in Him might become the
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.100]   children of God.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.600]   And according to the teaching of the New Testament, we are meant to know it in this
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.480]   life and in this world, and we're meant to enjoy it.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.440]   The Christian is not a man who hopes to become a child of God.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.200]   He should be a man who knows he's a child of God, and he's meant to rejoice in it.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.000]   He's meant to reap the benefits of it, even here.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.960]   "Celestial fruits on earthly ground from faith and hope may grow," says Isaac Watts
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.960]   very rightly.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.760]   And what we are doing at the moment is we are trying to make sure and to make certain
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.160]   that we really are the children of God.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.680]   Now my primary object in dealing with this is not to make people feel uncomfortable,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.020]   but to give assurance.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.720]   If God's Word does make us feel uncomfortable, well then that's entirely our own fault.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.880]   But my object in putting these tests before you is to try to help all of us to know that
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.920]   we really are the children of God.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.680]   That's my design and end.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.880]   It is inevitable, of course, that in doing that we shall be searched, we shall be examined.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.440]   And if at times some of us begin to feel we're not Christians at all, very well then even
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.100]   that is a part of God's grace to us, because it will drive us back to the very beginning,
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.200]   and we shall have to discover whether somehow or another we are not still trying to justify
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.120]   ourselves by works.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.760]   It will cast us back upon the grace and love and mercy of God, and we can start anew and
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.240]   afresh and make certain of our whole position.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.680]   Well now, in putting these tests, we have found that they're almost endless in number,
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.100]   and having considered our relationship to the Son and to the Father, we are now concerned
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.160]   about our relationship to the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.980]   And having looked at this in general, and having dealt particularly with his leading,
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.760]   so many of us are led by the Spirit of God, they are the children of God, they are the
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.320]   sons of God, and we've considered that in every aspect, including the very practical
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.680]   matter of the mortification of sin, the mortification of the deeds of the body, and so on.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.980]   But now we've arrived at the point when, having looked at the danger and the awareness
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.240]   of the child of God, of the danger of grieving the Spirit, and his fear lest he should ever
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.760]   do so, we have come to a more positive test, and a very delicate test, which is the manifestation
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.640]   of the fruit of the Spirit within us.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.640]   Now here is an obvious test.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.120]   The Holy Spirit dwelling within us produces certain fruit, and we are looking at it in
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.200]   terms of the description of this fruit of the Spirit given by the Apostle in the fifth
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.520]   chapter of the epistle to the Galatians, where he tells us that the fruit of the Spirit,
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:05:03.960]   verses 22 and 23, is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.700]   Against such, he says, there is no law.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.960]   Now I emphasize the fact that he says the fruit of the Spirit, not the fruits.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.520]   These are all different aspects of the same thing.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.760]   They all are interrelated, and it's difficult to have one without having all the others
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.880]   in some measure at the same time.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.400]   And I have also emphasized the fact that we are dealing here not with the so-called gifts
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.080]   of the Spirit.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.320]   You will read all about them in 1 Corinthians 12.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.060]   These are not the gifts; these are the graces, and therefore a much more delicate and sensitive
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.920]   test, of course.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.120]   We know that the gifts have at times been given to people who subsequently have shown
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.400]   quite clearly that they were never Christians at all.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.960]   The Holy Spirit may give temporary gifts to people.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.280]   The devil can counterfeit many gifts, but he can never counterfeit the graces.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.800]   And that is why this is, of all tests, the most delicate and the sensitive.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.080]   And I indicated also that it's a much more delicate test than the test of knowledge.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.160]   Knowledge puffeth up charity edifier.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.000]   This is, in other words, one of the most thorough tests we can ever face.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.480]   And there the Apostle mentions nine things, you remember.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.560]   And we have suggested that they might be classified into three main groups.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:49.640]   The first group describes our essential nature as Christiansâ€”love, joy, peace.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:56.520]   We looked at them, and we saw the essential difference between what he means there by
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:04.320]   love and the sentimental rubbish that the world often passes as love.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:11.040]   We saw the difference between the joy that is given by the Holy Ghost and the superficially
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:17.920]   bulliont happiness, so-called, of which the world makes so much, and likewise the peace,
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.680]   the positive character of this peace.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.840]   Well now, the Christian fundamentally is a man, therefore, who has within his being,
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.660]   in the depths, those qualities.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.960]   There is this element of love that controls everything.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:44.480]   And this fundamental joy and rest, a heart at leisure from itself, the peace which the
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.600]   Lord Jesus Christ gives, which the world can neither give nor ever take away.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.800]   My peace, that's it, my peace I give unto you.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.200]   But as the world giveth, give I unto you.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.200]   Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.280]   Of course, there may be commotions on the surface, but the point I established, I think,
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.280]   was that down in the depths, these things abide.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:17.000]   They are the fundamental characteristics of the Christian, the one in whom the Spirit
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.720]   of God is resident, and in whom he produces his blessed fruit.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.320]   But we must go on to the second group.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:32.720]   The second group consists of long-suffering, gentleness, goodness.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:40.880]   Now I've suggested that these go under the heading of our relationship to others.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.320]   Having considered what we are to ourselves, essentially, we now go on to consider what
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.880]   we are in our relationship to others.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:57.040]   This of course, the second group, follows directly from the first group.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.160]   What a man is, he manifests.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.920]   So you must start with the man himself, and then you will be sure that he is this by the
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:14.120]   way in which he reacts to his surroundings and to his circumstances.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.840]   But of course, it carries the test a step further.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:27.400]   No man liveth unto himself, no man is an island, no man liveth in isolation.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:34.600]   We live in a world of people, and we live with others, and it is at this point of course
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.160]   that the test emerges.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:43.320]   It's one thing for a man to be alone in his study, or in a room, or way on top of
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:50.080]   a mountain, or in a cell in a monastery, and there feel that he knows something about this
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:57.920]   love of God and of Christ which passeth knowledge, and that he has a joy in his heart that nothing
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:07.520]   can disturb, and that he has this settled peace, a heart at leisure from itself.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.680]   But it's a very different thing for that same man suddenly to be confronted by people,
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:18.200]   persons, life, difficulties, problems.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:24.120]   But you see, the test goes on, the apostle doesn't leave it at love, joy, peace.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.320]   He brings us to this second group.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.600]   So in the end it comes to this, that you and I can tell best of all perhaps whether we
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:43.160]   as Christians are not, not when we are alone, but when we are with other people.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.920]   When we are surrounded, I say, by problems and difficulties, when we are in the world
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.000]   as it is and with people as they are.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Now we see here of course in a sense immediately the whole error behind monasticism.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.480]   That patently is not the way to do it.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:08.480]   The test is to live this life and have love, joy, peace in the midst of life.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.000]   That was the grand discovery that was made, or rather that came to Martin Luther.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.480]   It's the whole origin of the Reformation.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.880]   You don't divide people into the religious and the laity, no, no.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.200]   We are all religious, we are all saints.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.780]   The saints who belong to the church at Corinth or in Rome or wherever else it is.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:38.560]   And thus I say, our saintliness is of no value at all, unless it's a saintliness that shines
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.640]   out brightly in the midst of life.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:46.240]   It's not an artificial flower, it's not a hothouse plant, it's not something that is
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.320]   cultivated very delicately and no breath of air is ever allowed to disturb it, that's
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.960]   of no value.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:59.880]   John Milton in his Areopagitica puts that, I think, very rightly, he says, "I cannot
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.200]   praise a cloistered and a fugitive virtue."
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.800]   That's no good.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:11.480]   The virtue that he praises is the one that ventures forth and meets its adversary.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:19.840]   Now that's the kind of thing that emerges in this very list that the Apostle gives us.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.040]   You may come to the conclusion that all is well just when you're there on your own, cultivating
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.040]   your soul.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.360]   But no, you've got to come out, you've got to emerge.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.560]   The business of life calls upon you and there are things to be attended to and there are
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.400]   other people.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.720]   And here's the test.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.560]   How do we face this second group?
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:50.160]   Let's look at what he tells us, "Long suffering."
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:56.320]   There you are, you say, "Oh, I thank God for this love that's in my heart."
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:02.240]   Then you're suddenly confronted by very difficult people, very stupid people, people who don't
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.280]   understand what you're talking about, people who are selfish, self-centered, people indeed
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:14.880]   who may even be offensive to you, they may attack you, they may persecute you.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.080]   And now the question is, how do you react to them?
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.880]   What about your love, joy, peace now?
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.860]   What's happened to them?
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.600]   Because people can be very difficult.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.080]   We are all very difficult people, every one of us.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:39.440]   We don't think that, of course, in the isolation of the solitude, we are wonderful.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.640]   But the whole test is, I say, our behavior with respect to other people.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.720]   That's of no value unless it can stand up to this test.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:54.520]   The purpose of that is to enable us to do this.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.040]   And here, you see, the apostle says that our first great characteristic, if we are indeed
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:06.600]   bearing the fruit of the Spirit, is "long-suffering."
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.440]   What a rare thing this is.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.520]   All the fruit of the Spirit is rare, alas.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.640]   You know what he means by "long-suffering."
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:22.000]   The apostle gives us a very wonderful account of it all in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   We read it together last Sunday morning.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.440]   Let me just give you the salient points with regard to this particular thing.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:43.880]   "Charity suffereth long, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil."
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:54.800]   He tells us furthermore that "it beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.880]   things, endureth all things.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:08.320]   Charity never faileth."
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.600]   Very well, my friends, there it is.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.040]   That's one of the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.120]   You see the contrast, don't you?
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:23.000]   The private cultivation of the soul, of it then coming out into the midst of life, and
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:31.560]   all the pinpricks, the irritations, and all the problem of man and his folly and his stupidity
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.120]   and his behavior.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.400]   How does one react to it all?
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:41.360]   Well, what the apostle is saying in effect is this, that the man who has the Spirit of
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:51.080]   God in him and in whom the Spirit of God is bearing fruit, this man is not disturbed because
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:57.600]   of the love and the joy and the peace that are in him.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:04.160]   He's got such a settled condition of his soul and his spirit that he can't be upset
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:11.760]   easily, and he can bear with people, and he can take all that comes without himself losing
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.880]   this fundamental characteristic of his.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.980]   That's what it really comes to.
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:21.640]   It is the test of the depth of the love and the joy and the peace that are in us.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:28.760]   The deeper the peace, the less easily is it going to be disturbed and upset by other people
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.320]   and their ways.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:39.000]   Very well then, perhaps the best thing to do is to look at some examples and illustrations
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   of this.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.600]   The supreme example of longsuffering, of course, is our blessed Lord himself.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.680]   Look at his treatment of a man like Judas Iscariot, how patient he was with him, though
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:58.320]   he knew exactly what was going to happen, how patient he was, how longsuffering, how
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:05.420]   he bore the contradiction of sinners against himself, as Hebrews 12 puts it, and as we
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.800]   see so clearly in the pages of the four Gospels.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:16.520]   But the apostle Peter sums it up very well for us, you remember, in his first epistle
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:24.420]   and in the second chapter, where he puts it like this, "Servants, be subject to your
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:31.640]   masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the frail one."
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.640]   That's the test.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:40.400]   "For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully."
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.000]   That's the test.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.400]   "For what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently?"
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:56.240]   We all ought to do that, there's no great credit in doing that.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:04.680]   "But if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.680]   God."
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.640]   When you're suffering grievous injustice, you've done your work, you've done what you
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.880]   were supposed to do, but you're punished for doing that.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.200]   Everything is wrong, yet you take it patiently.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:21.480]   This is acceptable with God, for even here unto where he called, because Christ also
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:30.160]   suffered for us, leaving us an example that he should follow his steps, who did no sin,
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.440]   neither was guile found in his mouth, who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:41.640]   he suffered he threatened not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:46.760]   Now that's it, and you've noticed how the apostle, in the twelfth chapter of the epistle
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.560]   to the Romans we read at the beginning, he puts exactly the same point, he says, "Don't
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.600]   you take vengeance, you be long-suffering."
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:00.200]   Remember that God has said, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay," saith the Lord.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.480]   And when the Spirit is bearing fruit in a man's life, whatever may happen to him, he
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.720]   acts on that principle, he says, "It's all right, this is not my business."
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:18.600]   So he is long-suffering.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.040]   It's only the Spirit that can enable us to be like this, nothing else.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.640]   You can resolve and decide as much as you like, but the moment you're confronted by
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.880]   the trial, you forget all your resolutions, your native spirit takes charge and you've
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:38.880]   lost all your patience, you're no longer long-suffering, you're irritable and you fall.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.360]   But the Spirit can enable us to do this.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.120]   One of the manifestations of the fruit of the Spirit is long-suffering.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:50.280]   And of course, thank God this is possible to all.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:55.000]   You get it in the life of the apostle Paul himself.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.800]   And I imagine that by nature he could have been a very irritable man.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.960]   He was a passionate man.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.080]   He was a man of deep and profound feeling.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.720]   He was a man who felt things very deeply and very strongly, very powerfully.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.960]   And yet, there is nothing more remarkable about him as those of us who attend here on
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:20.680]   Friday nights have been seeing recently, than the way in which he manifested this long-suffering
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.480]   with respect to his own fellow countrymen, the Jews.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.280]   From the moment he became a Christian, from the moment he became an apostle, they reviled
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.800]   him, they persecuted him, they abused him, they heaped every insult they could think
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.040]   of upon him.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:40.040]   Never was a man treated so shamefully as the apostle Paul was by his own fellow countrymen.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:46.480]   But listen to what he says, Romans 9, 1 to 3, "I say the truth in Christ, I lie not,
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:52.080]   my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness and
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:59.360]   continual sorrow in my heart, for I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ,
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.500]   for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to the flesh."
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:11.680]   Listen to him again in chapter 10, the first two verses, "Brethren, my heart's desire
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:20.440]   and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved, for I bear them record that
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.800]   they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:30.480]   Oh yes, it's possible for the disciple to follow his master.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:39.000]   The Spirit can produce this spirit of long-suffering within us."
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.480]   Do you find it in yourself?
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:50.480]   Do you find it in yourself when you're concerned perhaps with relatives who are not Christians
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:56.440]   and who can be very irritable, who are irritable because you've become a Christian, and Christ
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:01.080]   has come before them in your esteem, and they're sensitive, and they hate him because of it,
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.400]   and they hate everything you do with respect to him.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.480]   How do you bear with them?
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.920]   Are you long-suffering, are you patient?
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.120]   The fruit of the Spirit is long-suffering.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:19.620]   Very well, we must leave it at that, let's go on to the next thing, which is gentleness.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.840]   Now it's generally agreed that while this, in a sense, does convey the right meaning,
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:31.360]   a better translation here would be the word kindness, kindness.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:36.440]   In other words, as Christians, we've not only got to bear with people and put up with
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:42.600]   them and put up with a lot of wrong and injustice and misunderstanding and persecution and so
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.600]   on.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.600]   It doesn't end at that.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.520]   There is something which is really ultimately negative about long-suffering, but here's
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.200]   something positive, kindness, gentleness.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:03.840]   This means that not only do we not hit back, but that we handle them gently, that we are
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:10.000]   not harsh with respect to them, but that we are ready to forgive them, that our whole
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.680]   attitude towards them is one of kindness.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.280]   And this applies, of course, as the New Testament teaching makes quite plain and clear, even
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.920]   to our handling of our enemies.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.840]   And this is where this is such a thorough test.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.400]   Now I want to make this point clear, lest it can be misunderstood.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:36.640]   I sometimes think that at the present time there is a very great danger that many Christian
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:43.240]   people misunderstand what is meant by this gentleness and by this kindness.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.720]   And I think it is of very great importance for the whole situation of the Christian church
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.480]   at the present time, because there are many who seem to interpret this as meaning that
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:57.520]   a man is tolerant of everything, will agree with everything.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:02.440]   It doesn't matter what is said, all is well.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:08.560]   Kindness is mistaken for a general affability, but it's a very, very different thing.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.120]   But let me put it like this.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.560]   In this list of the fruit of the Spirit, the Apostle is dealing with it from the personal
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.840]   standpoint.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:26.240]   He is dealing at this point with our personal relationships with other people, so that we
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:33.120]   must never interpret gentleness as meaning nothing but a lack of character.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.280]   Gentleness and kindness do not mean spinelessness.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:48.880]   They don't just mean niceness, or the absence of any strong, firm characteristics.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:54.160]   Now I make this point because one's got to do so in order to reconcile the Scriptures
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.160]   with themselves.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:03.320]   I have just read to you how the Apostle dealt with his fellow countrymen and how he reacted
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.320]   to them.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.440]   If you remember, it is the same Apostle who says there in Galatians 5 that one of the
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:15.320]   manifestations of the fruit of the Spirit is gentleness or kindness.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:21.040]   Let us remember that exactly the same Apostle writes like this, in the first chapter of
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:27.120]   the same epistle to the Galatians, "Though we or an angel from heaven preach any other
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:35.080]   gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.240]   And he repeats that.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.640]   Now that's very strong language.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:47.040]   And he does the same thing later on where he's dealing with that whole question of
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:54.840]   circumcision and the people who are troubling and bothering the members of the churches
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.840]   in Galatia.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.000]   He says, "I wish that these people themselves were cut off."
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.320]   Now, how do you reconcile that?
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:10.200]   Well, the way we reconcile that is perfectly simple.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.880]   You see it in our Lord himself.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.520]   We are told of him, "The bruised reed, he will not break; the smoking flax, he will
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.800]   not quench; the meek and the lowly Jesus."
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.760]   Oh, the gentleness and the kindness of our blessed Lord.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:33.880]   But remember, it is the same person who turns finally upon the Pharisees and says, "Woe
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.440]   unto you Pharisees, hypocrites!"
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.600]   One of the most terrible denunciations in the whole of the Bible is to be found in the
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.600]   23rd chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:49.200]   And it is the same gentleness and kindness that does that.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.360]   Now, how do we reconcile them?
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:59.080]   Well, we reconcile them in our Lord and in the Apostle in this way.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:04.760]   There is all the difference in the world between contending for the truth with strength, with
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:13.880]   vigour, with clarity and with power, and our personal handlings and dealings with people.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.320]   It is a very difficult point.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.400]   Some people never seem to have grasped it.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.320]   There are some people who cannot defend the truth without attacking persons.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.160]   That seems to me to be a denial of the New Testament teaching.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.000]   We must be angry and sin not, that is it.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   You are to be angry.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.720]   There is such a thing as righteous indignation.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:40.280]   A Christian man who can listen to people denying the deity of our Lord, even perhaps denying
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:45.800]   the very being and person of God, denying the miracles and the atonement and the resurrection
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:52.480]   and the person of the Holy Spirit, a man who just smiles at all that and says, "Well,
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:59.720]   of course, I must always be kind and manifest love, and therefore I say nothing," he is
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.840]   a man who is denying the whole of the New Testament.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:11.000]   Oh no, error and sin are to be denounced, and to be denounced strongly.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:19.500]   But that is not incompatible with being gentle and being kind in your personal relationships.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:25.440]   We have to differentiate between the error and the people who are the innocent or deluded
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.880]   victims of the error, blinded by the God of this world.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.360]   That is the kind of distinction.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:35.920]   Now, I am emphasizing this, as I say, because the climate of opinion in which we find ourselves
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.600]   today is one which smiles at anything.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   Nothing matters.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:45.240]   We are all one, and we must all be kind and nice to the people and say whatever we like.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.680]   That is not the thing the apostle means when he talks about one of the manifestations of
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:55.800]   the fruit of the Spirit being kindness and gentleness.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:03.960]   We are to learn how to oppose the truth, but still not to bear malice, not to be unkind
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:10.120]   to people, not to be boorish, not to be offensive.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:17.400]   We draw this vital distinction between the error and those who are the dupes and the
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.440]   victims of the error.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:25.160]   Very well, the question is, my friends, do we find any evidence of this gentleness, this
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.160]   goodness in us?
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:32.720]   Are we, with respect to those whom we know to be deniers of the truth, as the apostle
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:38.560]   Paul was to his fellow countrymen, the Jews?
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:45.040]   But then we come to the next term, which is the term "goodness," and this carries
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.000]   it just a step further again.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:56.960]   You see, not only do we not react, but we are longsuffering, not only are we kind towards
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:04.920]   them, we must even manifest this spirit of goodness with respect to them.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:11.400]   He means by that that we desire their good, that we are well disposed toward them in spite
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.600]   of what they are, in spite of what they are doing, and in spite of what they are doing
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.960]   to us.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:21.840]   That our greatest desire with respect to them is to help them, and if we get an opportunity
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.120]   of doing them a good turn or a kind act, we jump at it, and we are always ready to do
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.120]   it.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.880]   That is what he means by "goodness."
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:34.760]   Now there is no need for me to keep you with this, because we have a perfect exposition
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.800]   of this very matter from the lips of our blessed Lord himself.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.200]   It is in the Sermon on the Mount; you will find it in the fifth chapter of the Gospel
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.760]   according to St. Matthew.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:49.560]   Let me read from verse 43 to the end.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:59.920]   You have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:10.640]   But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:17.740]   hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.240]   the children of your Father which is in him.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:26.880]   For he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.680]   and on the unjust.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.240]   For if you love them which love you, what reward of you?
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.720]   Do not even the publicans the same?
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.720]   And if you salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others?
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.160]   Do not even the publicans so?
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:48.320]   Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in him is perfect.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.800]   Now you notice the emphasis.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:32:00.840]   Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.800]   them which despitefully use you and persecute you.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:10.080]   Now that is what the Apostle means when he talks about goodness as being one of the manifestations
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.520]   of the fruit of the Spirit, that with regard to these very people who are acting as your
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:19.280]   enemies and doing everything they can to upset you and to ruin perhaps your character and
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:26.100]   your life and your everything, you are ready to do good to them even as God sends the rain
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:32.200]   and the sun upon the good and the bad and the evil and the righteous at the same time.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:38.100]   And so he says you are perfect even as your Father which is in him is perfect.
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:43.880]   We are to be like God in this matter.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:49.040]   It's only the man who has the Holy Spirit in him who does this.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.960]   Your good moral men may refrain from doing a man harm perhaps.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.680]   He'll never go beyond and do him good.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.680]   It's the Christian alone.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.680]   Why?
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.240]   Well the Christian understands the man.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:03.840]   He knows that the man really is the slave of the devil and of sin and of the evil fallen
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.160]   nature that's in him.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:09.160]   He differentiates between the man and his own evil nature and he wants the man to be
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:18.620]   delivered so he does him good and he delights in doing so.
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.820]   Much more difficult, isn't it, than being alone in your study with the Scriptures and
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:27.900]   praying and feeling how wonderful everything is?
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.980]   Oh, but my dear friends, these are the tests of life.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.700]   Very well, let's go on and have a look at the third and the last group which the Apostle
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.260]   puts before us.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.980]   Faith, meekness, temperance.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:47.300]   Here again we are back to our general character and especially as it manifests itself in the
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.500]   sight of and before God.
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.500]   Faith.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:56.940]   Well now, here again, unfortunately, is not the right translation at all.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:57.940]   It doesn't mean faith.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:58.940]   It means faithfulness.
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:06.260]   He's not talking about faith in the sense that he talks about faith as one of the gifts
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.700]   of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 12.
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:14.340]   You will find there in 1 Corinthians 12, in the list of the gifts of the Spirit, he says
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.260]   the gift of faith.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.260]   And that, of course, means the kind of gift that was given to a man like George Muller
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.680]   or Hudson Taylor.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.260]   It doesn't mean the faith whereby one believes in Christ, because everybody's got that.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:30.700]   By grace are we saved through faith and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God that's
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:31.700]   common to all.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:36.500]   There in 1 Corinthians 12, this is a special gift of faith.
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.540]   But that isn't what he's talking about in Galatians 5.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:47.600]   Because he's not talking about gifts here, he's talking about these graces, these manifestations
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.420]   of the life of the Spirit in us and through us.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:55.340]   And therefore this undoubtedly means, and indeed the very word used tells us that, he
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:35:01.940]   means faithfulness.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:08.020]   And this is one of the wonderful manifestations of the gift of the Spirit.
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.920]   I suppose this is the one that a minister of a church, a pastor, looks for more than
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:18.260]   anything else in the members of his flockâ€”faithfulness.
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:24.380]   He means by this, of course, dependability, he means reliability, he means loyalty.
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:31.180]   It's the opposite of a man who's a Christian as it were by fits and starts, who manifests
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.740]   these things in spasms.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:38.320]   At one moment he seems the most wonderful Christian you've ever met, but it doesn't
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.320]   last.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:45.700]   He's right down the next time, always changing, fitful.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:49.020]   You never know what he's going to be like when you see him next.
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:54.060]   You can't rely upon himâ€”unstable character.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:36:02.180]   Well now what the apostle is saying is this, that the Spirit produces stability, reliability.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:07.180]   He produces a settled condition.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:16.180]   He produces such depths in the character that there's something solid and durable, dependable
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.100]   and reliable.
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.140]   You know where you're going to find this man.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.980]   You know what he's going to be like.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.860]   You can always be certain about him.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:34.420]   Now again let's bear in mind that this is something very positive.
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:42.460]   There is a natural kind of person who is more or less always the same, but that kind of
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.660]   natural person who's always the same is like that because there's not very much
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.180]   in him.
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:51.100]   There's not much that can vary in him.
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:56.100]   If we were discussing these things from the natural standpoint, well of course we would
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.100]   have to defend the person who does change a good deal.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:05.180]   You'll find that the great men of the world, the great leaders, have been men of passion
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:10.080]   and they've sometimes been in a rage and in a temper, at other times they're gentle.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:17.620]   That's because they're big, and where you've got bigness you've got variation.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:24.940]   We are tending today to glorify the person who's just an aggregate of negatives.
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:30.860]   So many of these highly paid personalities, so-called, are just that it seems to me.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.580]   We are told they're so good because they're inoffensive and so on.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:37.820]   In other words, they're lacking in character, there's an absence of quality.
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:42.280]   God forbid that we should confuse that with what the Apostle is talking about here.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:47.700]   What he's saying is this, that though men by nature may be explosive, and though he
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:53.880]   may be big and have these variations in him, what the Spirit does is to harness them all,
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:59.340]   and so you've got these mighty forces and powers, channeled by the Holy Ghost, and what
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.780]   a wonderful thing it is then.
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:07.780]   That's what he means, that they're all brought under the control of the Spirit, and you've
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.940]   got a real powerful character.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:15.620]   Look again at the Apostle Paul and you'll see all that I mean.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:21.620]   You'll see all the strength and the passion and the power, mastered, directed, channeled,
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:27.700]   and so he's reliable, he's dependable, he's a faithful man.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:31.820]   Well, this is one of the manifestations of the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:32.820]   Let's go on.
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:42.380]   The next is meekness, and this means, of course, that this person is humble.
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.380]   He is humble especially before God.
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:49.500]   He's the exact opposite of the Pharisee, who went right forward to the front and said,
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.340]   "I thank thee, God, that I'm not like other men are."
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:57.020]   That's the antithesis of meekness.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:05.900]   You see it in the publican in the same building, smiting his breast, "God, be merciful to me,
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:06.900]   a sinner."
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:07.900]   Meekness.
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:12.580]   "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:18.180]   The man who's bearing the fruit of the Spirit is a man who's humble before his God and walks
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:21.380]   humbly with his God.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:26.660]   He's heard the exhortation, "Humble yourselves unto the mighty hand of God," and he's always
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:27.660]   doing so.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:34.700]   Oh, there's a terrible absence of this characteristic, I fear, in the modern church.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:38.740]   We're aggressive, we're self-contained, we do things in a businesslike manner.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.940]   There's an absence of this meekness.
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.020]   Read the biographies of the saints.
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:49.060]   Read about a man like Robert Murray M'Cheyne, David Brainerd, Jonathan Edwards, and the
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.540]   rest, and you'll find there's meekness and humility.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:59.180]   But not only is he meek before God, he's equally meek in himself and in his own view of himself.
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:03.060]   The man who has the fruit of the Spirit is the man who knows best his own smallness,
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.160]   his own lack of gifts.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.980]   He's a man who has a very poor conceit of himself.
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:14.260]   Now this isn't mock modesty; he really sees it, he really knows it.
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:17.380]   He abominates himself, he hates himself.
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.700]   Charles Adams Spurgeon said he wouldn't cross that road to listen to himself preaching.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.300]   That's true meekness.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:24.300]   That's true meekness.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.300]   He meant it.
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.500]   He really meant it from the depth of his heart.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:34.220]   But it means this, you see, that as one is meek and in one's view of oneself, and here's
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:42.300]   a very good way of testing it, the more meek we become, the less sensitive we become.
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:48.340]   The less sensitive to the criticism of others, the less resentful of it, because we know
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:52.080]   that it's true and we know more about it even than they do.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.820]   We could say even worse things ourselves.
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:03.380]   But it's also a meekness that shows itself before others and with respect to others.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:08.280]   Now here again the simplest thing for me to do is to read this great statement of it by
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:16.500]   the Apostle Paul in the second chapter of the Epistle to the Philippians.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:21.900]   Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.460]   other better than themselves.
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:28.780]   Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:36.460]   Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God,
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:42.140]   thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, took on
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.580]   him the form of a servant who was made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:52.660]   as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:53.980]   That's it, my friends.
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:58.560]   Be like Moses, the meekest man in all the earth.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.800]   Be like our Lord himself.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.260]   There you see it all.
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:08.980]   So that the Apostle in writing to the Corinthians in the tenth chapter of his second epistle
[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:15.120]   is able to appeal to them like this, "Now I, Paul, myself, beseech you by the meekness
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:21.180]   and gentleness of Christ, who in presence embays among you, but being absent, am bold
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.180]   toward you."
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.640]   That's it.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:29.520]   But listen to some other things that this man says about himself, how salutary it is
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.780]   and how we should thank God that he gives us these occasional insights.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.420]   Whenever the Apostle does talk about himself, it isn't to say, "What a wonderful man
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:40.160]   he was, how great an evangelist he was," and so on.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:45.760]   This is what he says, "I am the least of the Apostles, that am not me to be called
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:52.500]   an Apostle, because I persecuted the church of God, but by the grace of God I am what
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.500]   I am."
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:56.500]   And listen to him putting it again, he could never get over this.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.480]   He was amazed that he was ever found in the ministry at all.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:07.340]   So he puts it in Ephesians 3.8 in these words, "Unto me, who am less than the least of
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:15.620]   all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:18.520]   riches of Christ."
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:23.120]   The Apostle was amazed at the fact that he ever was an Apostle.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.340]   He is less than the least of all saints.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:26.880]   That isn't much modesty.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:30.700]   That isn't your type of man, you know, who comes to you and says, "Of course I am nobody
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.700]   in the church, I'm just an ordinary man," and he wants you to know what a wonderful
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:34.700]   man he is.
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:35.700]   It's the opposite of that.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:39.900]   He really believed what he was writing.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:44.280]   He was astounded that the grace of God had ever come to him.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.540]   So I come to our last word, which is the word "temperance."
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:54.260]   And this, of course, means self-control, it means discipline, it means behaving like an
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.260]   athlete.
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:44:01.340]   You read about these men before their test matches or before their special games of football.
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.500]   They don't smoke, they don't drink.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.820]   They discipline themselves in order to be fit for the great contest.
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.660]   Well, the Christians always like that.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:12.180]   He doesn't do that on special occasions only.
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:21.420]   He does it alwaysâ€”temperance, avoidance of evil, keeping away from all which is harmful,
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:26.720]   all that saps us of strength and power and ability, and everything that enables me to
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.780]   manifest forth his glory and his praise.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:34.260]   Temperance, disciplined life, order, regulated life.
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:38.300]   All right, let's listen to the apostle once more.
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:44.340]   He writes to a man like Timothy, and he says, in 2 Timothy 1, 7, "God hath not given us
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:49.900]   the spirit of fear, but of power and of love."
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.900]   Notice again, power and love are not incompatible.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:56.220]   Love is not weak and flabby and sentimental and sickly.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:06.260]   Love is powerful, power, love, and a sound mind, which means discipline.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:12.180]   And the spirit always leads to discipline.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:17.620]   The more disciplined our lives, the more certain we can be that we are the children of God.
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:21.100]   The spirit always leads to it.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.220]   In other words, the true Christian is able to control himself.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.300]   The spirit enables him to control himself.
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.740]   He controls his temperament.
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.300]   The temperament isn't changed.
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.320]   Our temperaments are not taken away from us.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.500]   We don't become negations.
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.980]   We don't become a series of postage stamps.
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:39.460]   No, no, your temperament, your personality is left to you, but the spirit enables you
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:44.980]   to control it, and then it can be used to the glory of God.
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:50.620]   But it's under control, it's under discipline, controlled by the spirit, controlled by the
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:51.620]   truth.
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:56.820]   So, you see, the Christian is not wayward, he's not carried away, he's not a victim
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.060]   of circumstances and of other people.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:04.780]   He's always under this control of the spirit and able to control himself.
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:08.340]   You see, that was the trouble with Timothy.
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.780]   Timothy was having difficulties in his churches, Timothy was being persecuted, Timothy could
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.460]   see Paul in prison and had heard rumours that he was to be put to death, and he got alarmed
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:17.780]   and excited, "What's going to happen?"
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.060]   He says, "Christianity's finished."
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:25.820]   "And," says the Apostle, "where's your discipline, where's your sound mind, where's your self-control?
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:30.300]   Haven't you got such a grasp of the truth as to see what God's purpose is and that these
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:31.820]   things mustn't upset you?"
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:32.820]   That's it.
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:41.580]   Temperance, self-control, discipline, orderliness in the life, not losing your balance constantly,
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:49.260]   but always with a mind that is under that final control of the spirit.
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:57.740]   And everything about us, therefore, is working to the one and the same great end.
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:04.860]   Everything about the person and the personality proclaims the fact that we are different.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:11.620]   "That's what you must do," says our Lord, "let your light so shine before men that they
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:18.900]   may see your good works, but glorify your Father which is in heaven."
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.820]   If you just like people who like you, well, you're no better than anybody else, he says,
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.360]   even the publicans do that.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.820]   If you're kind to people who are kind to you, the publicans are like that.
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:32.060]   "Oh, don't be like that," he says, "be like your Father."
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:35.960]   Be like your Father.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:46.180]   And we are like our Father who is in heaven when we are manifesting love, joy, peace,
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:48:00.380]   long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, temperance, self-control, orderliness
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:08.460]   in the life, everything directed to the glory of God.
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:12.940]   My dear friends, have I strengthened you this morning?
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:18.980]   Have I given you assurance that you are a child of God?
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:22.980]   God grant that I have.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:27.500]   But if I haven't, if I've disturbed you, if I've made you feel that you're not a Christian,
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:32.500]   very well, do something about it, go to him, acknowledge it, confess it.
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:37.180]   It's the Spirit that produces the fruit.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:41.340]   And ask him so to fill you with his Spirit.
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:49.740]   Ask him so to shed his love abroad in your heart by the Spirit, that inevitably the fruit
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:54.140]   of the Spirit will begin to manifest itself.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:58.460]   If you don't find the fruit, what you need is not to decide to do this or that, you need
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:04.180]   the Spirit in all his fullness.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:13.740]   So go and ask that God should shed his love abroad in your heart, in great profusion,
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:17.740]   in overwhelming power.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:26.900]   And you'll be amazed at yourself as you begin to see increasingly these manifestations of
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:30.420]   the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.460]   Amen.
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:36.380]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
