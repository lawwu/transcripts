[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.720]   - All right, so thanks for that question, Kobe.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.340]   All right, Jesse, what do we have on the docket next?
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.240]   - Our next question is from Pablo.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.360]   He's got a two-part question.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.840]   His first is he wants your thoughts
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.480]   on how to persuade his girlfriend to minimize social media.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.580]   - Oh, man.
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.240]   - And he should read your news article
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.520]   about the Twitter in January.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.440]   And then part two is he actually has a question
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.800]   about his bodybuilding,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.280]   and if that counts as high-quality leisure.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.240]   - Jesse, how many girlfriends do you think
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.760]   are out there in the world right now
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.760]   who curse my name because their nerd boyfriend
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.840]   is pushing some Cal Newport idea,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.840]   and they finally just say, "Enough, enough.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.360]   "I don't wanna hear about Cal Newport."
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.360]   I think I have been cursed in apartment buildings
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.600]   and living rooms.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.080]   - More now that your Today Show appearance.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.720]   So all those.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.640]   - That's right.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.800]   - There's a big audience there.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.640]   - That's right.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.880]   Well, yeah, now that I'm world famous
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.000]   from being on the Today Show,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.860]   it's only gonna make this problem worse.
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.800]   Now that I wear suit jackets to work,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.560]   I'm gonna start wearing a suit jacket on air
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.560]   for this podcast.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.320]   I think you should too.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.320]   I think it's just about showing people that we're pros
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.080]   a suit jacket and tie.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.960]   - I never use my ties in my closet,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.520]   so maybe it'd be a good excuse to put them on.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.760]   - Yeah, we could do the Lexford Mint thing,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.440]   wear the same suit every time.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.760]   - All right, here's Pablo.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.240]   - Hi, Cal.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.880]   First and foremost, thank you for drastically improving
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.680]   my quality of life.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.660]   I wanted to ask two questions.
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.160]   To start, I want to know your thoughts
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.880]   on how I can harmoniously persuade my girlfriend
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.340]   into minimizing her social media use.
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.800]   - All right, Pablo.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.720]   So for the first question,
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.080]   minimizing social media use,
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.120]   how to encourage someone else in your life to do that,
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.200]   it's dangerous waters.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.800]   Dangerous waters when you're trying to tell someone else
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.840]   about an improvement you think they should make,
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.420]   regardless of what the topic is.
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.120]   I think anyone who's been in a relationship
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.400]   knows this experience.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.200]   It's usually not gonna go well,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.040]   so you have to be very careful there.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.600]   I usually recommend that what people do
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.360]   is be the change they want to see in the world
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.280]   where you can replace world with spouse or boyfriend
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.880]   or girlfriend or kids or what have you.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.640]   Be the change you want to see.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.500]   So first of all, live your life
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.360]   in the way that you think is valuable.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.300]   Use the phone-foyer method.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.520]   Don't have your phone with you.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.960]   Don't have social media accounts
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.160]   or the accounts you do use,
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.980]   you use on a schedule on a desktop
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.760]   for very specific purposes.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.500]   Let the other person in your life see what that brings you.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.840]   The concentration, the peace, the lack of anxiety.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.960]   Let them see that.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.800]   Then be clear when the topic comes up
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.000]   why and how you're doing that.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.600]   Oh, well, I'm a digital minimalist
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.580]   and this is what digital minimalism is
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.080]   and I've built my life around using this in this way
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.120]   and not that and I'm getting a lot of benefits about it.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.120]   So they know what's going on.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.480]   They know why you're doing it and how you're doing it.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.520]   At that point, then you have to let the seed
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.480]   germinate on its own.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.920]   And you have to let the other person see what you're doing,
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.120]   know that it's an option,
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.720]   know the philosophy behind it and make that step of,
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.200]   you know, "Kobe, I think I wanna do this.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.120]   Do you wanna do it with me?
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.440]   Do you wanna help me?"
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.560]   But you can't push it that hard.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.940]   Now, if you wanna be, you know, nudging,
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.720]   you can try to do a new year thing.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.760]   So I talked about in a recent episode that this January,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.400]   when this episode is coming out, January, 2022,
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.100]   I've announced on my newsletter
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.760]   an analog January challenge,
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.680]   which was built just around not using Twitter
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.520]   for the month.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.760]   So you might do something like that,
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.280]   built around new year's resolutions and say,
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.480]   "Hey, do you wanna do this with me?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.860]   I think it'd be fun."
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.500]   So you could try that, but for the most part,
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.120]   be the change you wanna see in others
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.820]   and let the others come to you.
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.480]   The most extreme alternative to that I've heard is
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.640]   on one of my events I was doing
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.660]   on the digital minimalism tour,
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.880]   I met a parent who was worried about their teenage kids'
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.920]   social media use.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.840]   So they took their devices on a long car trip.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.280]   So they had no, nothing to look at or listen to,
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.760]   and then put digital minimalism audio book on in the car
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.300]   and basically forced them to listen to digital minimalism.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.900]   So that would be the opposite extreme.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.920]   And those kids went on to invent TikTok.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.900]   So that backfired.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.380]   (upbeat music)
