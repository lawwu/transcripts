[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 29.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.360]   On today's show, the iron law of wealth building.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.140]   I guess I should say the iron formula of wealth building.
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.920]   The only three topics, the only three variables that you can adjust to ensure your long-term
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.920]   wealth.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:44.800]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast for today, Monday, July 28, 2014.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.960]   I am your host, Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.160]   Thrilled to be back with you.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.120]   Feeling a little bit better, not quite back at 100%, but a little bit better.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.120]   I couldn't stand to stay away from you any longer.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.640]   I figured I got to get you a show, got to get you a show.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:07.560]   Today, we're going to have a show on wealth building, my favorite.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.280]   It really was hard to be away.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.400]   I really look forward to recording these shows.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.640]   I enjoy doing it.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.200]   I just love doing it.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.720]   Being out and being sick last week to the point where a couple days I could barely even
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.960]   speak and usually I would roll over in bed.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.960]   What happened was that I just got run down as far as the amount of time.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.160]   I was staying up too late, getting up too early.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.640]   I got a lot of fun, exciting projects that I'm working on.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.800]   When I should quit and go to bed, I just, "Oh, just a little bit longer, a little bit
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   longer."
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.160]   A couple days in a row of going to bed at 11, getting up at 6, going to bed at 2, getting
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.800]   up at 6, going to bed at 12, getting up at 5, going to bed at 1, getting up at 7.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.440]   These don't work for me.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.360]   You would think that at this point in my life I would be smart enough to say no and to go
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.440]   to bed and force myself to do it.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.800]   I'm just trying to make progress on some projects that I've got going on.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.760]   Well, anyway, I didn't do it.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.240]   I didn't do what I should have done, which was listen to my wiser self and go to bed.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.400]   Today we are going to be ... We're back in the saddle.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   Last week was pretty challenging.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.360]   There were a few days when I would wake up in the morning and I'd try to say something
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.760]   and I couldn't even make my voice go.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.600]   Then I'd go get a cup of tea and after a little bit I could get some sounds to come out.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.200]   It's certainly sobering when you recognize that none of us are invincible.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.000]   It's so easy to ... I sold a lot of disability insurance over the years and I'm convinced
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.720]   that I'm not invincible.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.120]   But in the past when I was talking about disability insurance I would never understand why people
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.120]   did not recognize that they weren't invincible.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.200]   Then now I think it's experiences like this that help you to recognize that you're not
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.200]   invincible.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.160]   You've got to take time, as Stephen Covey would say, to sharpen the saw, to go to bed
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.360]   early and get a full night's sleep and stay healthy and active because you can't help
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.200]   anybody if you're flat on your back in bed.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.000]   You've got to be up and active to be able to help anybody.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.360]   So we're back at it today.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.720]   Today we are going to be talking about my formula for wealth building, or as I grandiosely
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.560]   put it in the introduction, the iron formula of wealth building.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.760]   I'm not sure if this is something that I made up or if this is something I stole from somewhere
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.120]   so long ago that I can't remember it.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.640]   I really have never heard many people talk about it this way, and I'm sure others have.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.640]   There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.840]   I don't expect to necessarily have an original idea, but I can't attribute it to anyone because
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.680]   I just kind of figured it out for myself.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.880]   Although again, if I've stolen this from you as an author or something, forgive me.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:09.320]   But I learned this formula by doing financial planning it for myself and for others.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.640]   And it's very simple, and it's all based upon the two financial statements that we've talked
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.640]   about.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.200]   If you haven't listened to episode 22 and episode 26, episode 22 was an introduction
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.680]   to the balance sheet, and then episode 26 was an introduction to the cash flow statement,
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.480]   how to create them for yourselves.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.360]   I would encourage you stop and go listen to those shows.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.800]   And before you listen to this show, create those two financial statements for yourself.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:41.600]   So go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/22 or /26 and you'll be able to hear those shows
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.360]   and create your own personal financial statements.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.880]   And then look at them and think about them as we're walking through today's show.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.400]   Because in reality, I'm going to do nothing more than just simply walk through how these
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.000]   interact with each other, but show how this leads to wealth.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.880]   So when you understand the workings between financial statements, whether that's business
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.560]   financial statements or personal financial statements, then it kind of solves all the
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.440]   things you're trying to solve.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.680]   And so here's what I would say, here's how I would prove that my formula for wealth works.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.680]   First of all, how are we defining wealth?
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.480]   In this sense, we're talking about financial wealth.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.600]   So financial wealth is going to be something that's going to show up on the balance sheet.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.000]   The balance sheet is made up of assets and liabilities.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.620]   And the financial assets are listed with a financial number.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.600]   So if you tell someone, I want to be wealthy, what that means is, if you're talking about
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.200]   financial wealth, what that means is we're going to increase the net worth that's listed
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.680]   on the balance sheet.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.640]   Now obviously, there are other kinds of wealth.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.040]   I would consider someone who has-- I'm the youngest of seven kids.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:57.320]   I would consider my father to be extremely wealthy, having the love of seven children,
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.080]   even if he didn't have a dollar saved.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.800]   And I would encourage you to always consider those things, the financial and the non-financial
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.240]   aspects of life and of wealth.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.080]   But in today's show, we're going to focus mainly on the financial wealth.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:22.080]   So being financially wealthy is defined as having a high net worth.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.080]   That's it.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.080]   Now high is a relative term.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.560]   So we could insert $1,000 net worth, $100,000 net worth, $1 million net worth, or $1 billion
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.840]   net worth.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.080]   You can determine the scale that we're going to use.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.480]   To the person who is just getting started in life-- I remember the first time I had
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.360]   $1,000 saved, that was pretty exciting.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.080]   I remember the first time I had $10,000 saved, that was pretty exciting.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.520]   Every stage along life is exciting.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.800]   And then to one person, they're first excited when they can save their first million dollars.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.200]   But how does the money get to be listed on the net worth statement?
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.560]   How does it actually show up at the bottom?
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.680]   Well, it gets there off the cash flow statement.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.200]   So the net worth statement is a snapshot in time.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.000]   And the cash flow statement is listed as over an accounting period.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.440]   So if you look at your net worth statement, you have a date.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.540]   So let's say today is July 28, 2014.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.900]   You can do a snapshot.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:25.120]   My net worth as of 3:01 PM as I record this show on July 28, 2014 is x dollars.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.960]   Now at 302, that may change if some of my net worth is invested in volatile assets,
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.540]   such as publicly traded stocks that I can go and I can check to see what their valuation
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.540]   is.
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:43.160]   And maybe at 303 or 315, that may be slightly different than it was when I originally made
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.720]   the balance sheet.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.200]   But it's good enough for now.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.120]   But the cash flow statement is over a period of time.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.240]   So the cash flow statement is showing over what the accounting wonks would say, an accounting
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.240]   period.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.880]   Usually this would be either a year or a quarter.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.560]   Those would be the two most-- and business would be the quarterly.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.360]   And for us, maybe we're talking about the annual or the monthly, depending on which
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.820]   one we're looking at.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.920]   So I don't care which one you use.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.480]   I usually prefer annual numbers.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.000]   But the way the money gets onto the balance sheet is it has to show up at the bottom of
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.920]   the cash flow statement as surplus.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:19.320]   So remember, the cash flow statement is inflows minus outflows equals a surplus or a deficit.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.320]   That's it.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.760]   So in order for the money to show up on the net worth statement, we've got to create a
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.960]   surplus from the cash flow statement.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.720]   And if we're going to build wealth from one accounting period to the next, let's say one
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.820]   month to the next, then we've got to make sure that there is a surplus at the bottom
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.640]   of the cash flow statement.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.700]   So what this leads you to is understanding that inflows minus outflows equals surplus.
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.600]   Surplus leads to wealth.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:49.560]   Then that uncovers really the only three levers that we can adjust, the only three levers
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:56.360]   that we can press on to affect the ultimate wealth that we wind up with.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:05.260]   And those levers are we can adjust the inflows, we can adjust the outflows, and we can adjust
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.180]   what happens with the surplus.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.780]   Let me talk about deficits for a moment.
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.500]   This is no different if we're talking about deficits.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.420]   So let's say that we did run the cash flow statement.
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.300]   We have inflows minus outflows equals a deficit.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.780]   Well, we can only adjust the inflows or the outflows to reduce the deficit.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.740]   And that's going to be step one.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.840]   If we have a deficit, we have a problem.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.280]   But we need to look at it and say, is this a temporary deficit or is this a structural
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.280]   deficit?
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:37.040]   And I'm sorry for using all the big words, but I'm trying to use the accounting words
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:44.640]   to kind of disconnect and decouple this from this financial conversation from all the normal
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:51.800]   emotionally charged words that exist around money and people's finances.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.960]   Now the idea of we're going to go on a budget makes it a little sound a little bit less
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.600]   difficult to say we're just going to reduce the outflows than it does to say we're going
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.980]   to go on a budget.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:07.040]   So I try to use the accounting words or the more precise words sometimes just to drive
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.040]   the point home.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.520]   And then if you want to go and use the emotional words, that's fine.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.320]   But if there's a deficit, we've got a problem.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:18.360]   So we look and say, is this a temporary deficit or is this a structural deficit?
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.460]   So example, you are a college student going to college.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.380]   You're not working for income.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.920]   You are studying in your classes and you are borrowing money on student loans to pay for
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.980]   school.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.640]   Do you have a temporary deficit or do you have a structural deficit?
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.580]   You have a temporary deficit.
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.800]   You're a college student.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.240]   So we know that that's going to change.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.480]   We know that something's going to change.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.520]   This would be what an entrepreneur would face when an entrepreneur is starting a business
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.020]   and they're beginning their business.
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:51.280]   They know they're probably going to be operating in a deficit for a period of time.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:57.160]   And deficit is not necessarily a problem as long as it's a temporary deficit, whether
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.080]   this is applied to individuals or to nations.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.480]   It's not necessarily a problem that a country has a deficit if it's a temporary deficit.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.600]   The United States of America has had deficits in the past and has deficits currently.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.040]   But then the problem is only if they're structural deficits.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:21.160]   If they're just temporary, hey, for this period of time, our expenses have exceeded our income,
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.840]   then that can be fine.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.880]   Again, I'm in the middle of starting some new businesses.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.800]   My expenses are exceeding my income.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:35.080]   This is not necessarily a problem unless that is going to be a long-term thing.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:40.680]   But if it's a structural deficit, my expenses are consistently exceeding our income and
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.920]   there's not a clear event on the horizon at which those times are going to change, now
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.920]   we have a problem.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.520]   We have a more significant problem.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.480]   And so if it's a deficit, what do we have to change?
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   Well, we can adjust the inflows or we can adjust the outflows, and probably we're going
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.160]   to do both.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.640]   So that's probably going to be the most effective plan is to adjust the inflows and adjust the
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.280]   outflows.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.440]   What is Dave Ramsey's plan?
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:14.280]   Work extra jobs, adjust the inflows, cut all your expenses, adjust the outflows.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.660]   So all we're doing is adjusting inflows and outflows and we have a deficit.
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.960]   So let's set aside the issue of deficits because I'm going to cover that in its own show as
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.280]   far as what to do.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.160]   But one more thing on deficits.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.080]   Even when we cut deficits and even the way that we cut deficits, it's all going to come
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.640]   back to this inflows, outflows, and surplus.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.560]   A rational approach to looking at deficits should say, well, guess what?
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.280]   I'm going to refinance my debt to get it at a lower rate.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.520]   Well, that cuts my outflows because it reduces my interest expense.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.600]   I'm going to choose to pay off my debt because by paying off my debt, I'm going to get a
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.160]   greater return on my surplus because there has to be surplus to pay off debt.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:03.200]   I'm going to get a greater return on my surplus by paying off debt than I would if I invested
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.240]   it elsewhere.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.280]   We'll talk through that as far as the financial and non-financial considerations of that.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.120]   But ultimately, it all just comes down to inflows and outflows.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.960]   Let's assume that there's a surplus now.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.040]   And let's ignore debts and deficits and all that stuff for another day.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:26.880]   The three levers that we have to push are inflows, outflows, and the investment of surplus.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.440]   Now I'm going to add another kind of sub-lever.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:38.480]   We can adjust the size and the characteristics of our inflows.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:45.000]   We can adjust the size and the characteristics of our outflows.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.640]   Or we can adjust the size measured in rate of return and the characteristics of our investments.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:59.520]   And into those three kind of adjustments, I can fit every single financial planning
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:05.560]   article, book, essay, anything that, you know, suggestion, advice, anything that people have
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.800]   to say.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.480]   Because a lot of it is just differentiation.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.500]   If you understand that wealth is only going to come by intelligent investment and growth
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:20.400]   of surplus, then you see through the smoke and mirrors of one person saying, "Cut expenses,
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.280]   cut expenses, cut expenses.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.280]   Inflows don't matter."
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.000]   And the other person saying, "It's stupid for you to worry about cutting expenses.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.880]   Make sure you just focus on your inflows and earn more money."
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.840]   No, mathematically, they both matter.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.480]   And the person who's just saying, "Cut expenses," would do better if they had focused on cutting
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.840]   expenses and increasing inflows.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.080]   And the person who says, "Expenses don't matter," no, mathematically, they do.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.000]   But you would do better if you increased your inflows and you decreased your outflows, decreased
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.360]   your expenses.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.680]   So I'm not mad about all this stuff.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.800]   I just laugh when I see people make these statements.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:58.160]   Now, what they're usually focusing on is the, what they're usually focusing on is going
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.320]   to be the behavioral characteristics.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.560]   So for example, maybe somebody is much more motivated to say, "It's important to me that
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.320]   I drink my Starbucks coffee every day.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.920]   And in exchange for that, I'm going to go ahead and work more at another job."
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.400]   But work more at another job, that may be fine for some person.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.000]   But for another person to say, "I don't want to work more at another job, and I'll just
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.360]   cut my Starbucks coffee."
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.360]   Neither of them is wrong.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   They're both right.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.560]   The only three things that we can adjust, the size and characteristics of inflows, the
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.440]   size and characteristics of outflows, and the size or rate of return and characteristics
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.360]   of the investment of the surplus.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.680]   So everything falls into that.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:48.000]   So when I think about financial planning, or someone asks a question, I immediately
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.880]   think, "Where am I on this formula?
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.720]   Inflows, outflows, or surplus?
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   What am I dealing with?
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   Inflows, outflows, or surplus?
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.080]   Inflows, outflows, or surplus?"
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.080]   And this just helps me to kind of isolate what we're focusing on.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.040]   You can't do it all at one time, I don't think.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.960]   You can't really do it all at one time.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:11.480]   But you can focus on these things concurrently.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.320]   You can do one, and then you can switch your attention to the other.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:20.680]   The human brain can do a lot of planning in these concurrently, even if we can't necessarily
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.160]   do them both at the same time.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.960]   I want to introduce two other concepts.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.880]   Or not introduce, but then bring in two other concepts that we can then apply to this formula
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.280]   and then walk through a number of examples of how we can use this.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.800]   Now that we've created the personal financial statements, how we can use this way of thinking
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:44.720]   about this formula to help us to guide our own financial plan.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.880]   So if I were doing this for a client, I could use this formula with a client.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.960]   Or this is one where doing it for yourself is really powerful.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.120]   So the other two things are compounding and leverage.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.160]   So the first thing is compounding.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.040]   Everyone knows about, or I hope you know about the importance of compounding.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.160]   I shouldn't assume.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.120]   I should do a show on compounding and just to show why it's so valuable.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:14.360]   But compounding is, as Albert Einstein, didn't he say, there's a quote, an Einstein quote
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.680]   that says, "Compounding is the eighth wonder of the universe."
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.920]   Something like that.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.760]   But the idea of compounding is very simple.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.800]   And I prefer to use non-financial examples.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:31.080]   But the focus of compounding is if you plant one grain of corn in the ground, then that
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:36.360]   grain of corn will grow, assuming that that seed is fertile.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.180]   That grain of corn will grow into a corn stalk, which will produce one head of corn, or one
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:47.120]   ear of corn, which will have many more kernels than the one that you put in the ground.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.260]   So I mean, that's a powerful example.
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.400]   If you do that each year, if you do that in the first year, you have one kernel of corn,
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.880]   you get an ear of corn.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.440]   You shell that corn, now you have many hundreds of kernels of corn.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.360]   You plant those many hundreds, now you probably have many hundreds of thousands of kernels
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.360]   that result.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.280]   That's how compound interest works.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.000]   Compounding works in every area of life.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.680]   So we want to look at that formula and we want to say, where can we apply compounding?
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.560]   So most people think of applying compounding to the investment of the surplus of their
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   wealth.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.920]   So they say, well, if I'm going to invest the money, I'm going to invest the money in
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.920]   stocks and it's going to grow over time.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.360]   Yes, it is.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.600]   But where else can we apply compounding?
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.680]   Can we apply compounding in our inflows?
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:38.280]   So can we apply compounding to the way that we earn a living and to the salary that we
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:43.760]   earn, to the amount of money that the marketplace rewards us with?
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.520]   Can we apply the idea of compounding to that?
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.960]   And can we compound that at a faster rate otherwise?
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:55.440]   And I'll come back to that in a moment and review that in depth.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.120]   The second thing of the concept is leverage.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.800]   So leverage can work for us or leverage can work against us.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.200]   And compounding can work for us or compounding can work against us.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:13.240]   If we're deeply in credit card debt and we have a substantial credit card balances on
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.520]   which we're paying relatively high interest rates, then we have leverage working against
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.440]   us because we're in debt and that leverage is compounding against us where the interest
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.920]   on those credit cards are compounding as time goes on.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.000]   But we can also apply leverage to other areas of life.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.580]   We can apply leverage to our inflows, apply leverage to our outflows, and apply leverage
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:41.140]   to the growth of our investments, of our surplus.
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.680]   And we can do this in both financial and non-financial ways.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.080]   Then we can get compounding working on our side.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:55.680]   So if you understand these flows, remember there's no net worth that's going to grow
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.400]   without having an excess, a surplus, coming from the cash flow statement.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.480]   So we've got to grow the balance sheet based upon the cash flow statement.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.200]   So look at some examples here.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.480]   And I want to use a couple of examples that most people may be thought of and then give
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.760]   some more out of the box examples that you may not have thought of.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.800]   Why is it that many people recommend going to college?
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.920]   You read stories and many people are recommended to go to college because going to college
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.840]   increases your lifetime earnings.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.480]   If you read the charts, the charts are all crystal clear that the total amount of lifetime
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:37.200]   earnings on average across the population is based, has a direct correlation to the
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.880]   level of education.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.120]   So a high school dropout has the lowest lifetime earnings.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.480]   A high school graduate has the next amount of lifetime earnings.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:54.120]   A bachelor's degree certificate for university has the next highest, then a master's, then
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.820]   a PhD.
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.680]   So the charts are very clear.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:07.480]   And so the idea, most people are doing this maybe subconsciously, but they're applying
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.560]   this formula and the way that these things work, they're applying these formulas to their
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.040]   financial planning suggestion.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.720]   And they're saying, you should in the beginning of your career, assuming that college is going
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.560]   to have an impact on your income, with that assumption, you should in the beginning of
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.320]   your career, you should run a deficit if you need to.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.280]   So you're going to run a deficit in your budget where your outflows are higher than your inflows
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.600]   in order to grow your salary higher.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.720]   And then you're going to have the advantage of that salary will be growing and compounding
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.080]   throughout time, throughout your lifetime.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.760]   So you're going to apply financial leverage through the use of a student loan.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.120]   And you're going to do that so that you can raise the amount of your inflows.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.920]   And then by raising the amount of your inflows so substantially, you're going to wind up
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.940]   to be wealthier over time.
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:59.680]   So by converting it into the formula, you can understand where the problems come in.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.640]   So problem number one comes in, what if the deficit is too high?
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.440]   And so what if the leverage is too high and it doesn't result in higher earnings?
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.880]   This is a problem many college students and college graduates face.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:17.440]   I borrowed a bunch of money, I owe $100,000, and I now have a career that's not resulting
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.920]   in higher inflows.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:23.280]   And because my career is not resulting in higher inflows, then I don't have sufficient
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.580]   inflows to cover the amount of the debt.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:31.160]   Or if I do have sufficient inflows to service the debt, I don't have any surplus on top
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.160]   of it.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.800]   And so I'm constantly left right scraping bottom.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:41.080]   And this is an unpleasant place to be when it comes to financial planning.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.760]   So you can see what you need to make sure of if you're going to do that, if you're
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.800]   going to use leverage, financial leverage, to go to college.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.000]   And you're going to borrow money and you're going to take on that deficit.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.120]   You need to make sure that you're going to do that in a way that it's going to actually
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.840]   result in higher inflows.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:06.380]   So people are intuitively using this formula when they're making the college decision.
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.840]   Now why do we pay off consumer debt?
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:12.080]   Well, we pay off consumer debt to free up cash flow and save on interest expense.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:17.200]   So by paying off consumer debt, we free the cash flows, so we lower the outflows, and
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:23.280]   then both, I'm not sure what the word would be, both nominally and across the board, both
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.760]   in the aggregate and then both on the specific because we lower the interest expense and
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.320]   also across the board because we lower that cash flow expense and we have our freedom
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.360]   of cash flow coming back with us.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.120]   So, I mean, that's it.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.160]   That's the whole point of paying off consumer debt is because as long as we have the consumer
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.700]   debt, we have assets that are going down in value, so that's not working.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.160]   So we need to build a surplus up and we need to increase the assets that are going up in
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.160]   value.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.200]   And the only way we can do that is if we can generate a higher surplus.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.760]   We pay off the consumer debt to generate surplus in our budget to build wealth.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:03.080]   So I hope this is not too repetitive, but I want to give some more examples because
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:08.760]   with these concepts of inflows and outflows and rate of return and then compounding and
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:17.000]   leverage with these tools, I think you can build some amazing futures.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.080]   We can build amazing futures for people.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.960]   Now you can't escape math.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.520]   The math still works.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.360]   It works whether you want to admit it or not.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.360]   Acknowledging it doesn't really matter.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.280]   It doesn't matter whether you acknowledge it.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.120]   It's still going to be -- the math is still going to be there functioning.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:37.140]   So it's better to not fight it and just understand it and then focusing on optimizing.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:41.720]   So if you're looking at your personal cash flow statement and your personal balance sheet,
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.400]   what you're going to do is apply the system of thinking and you can optimize each and
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.680]   every part of the equation.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.840]   So let's start on the cash flow statement.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.200]   You can optimize your inflows.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.160]   Now remember, I added two variables.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:59.840]   You can optimize the size and the characteristics of your inflows.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.340]   So first of all, you can optimize the size.
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.800]   Most people -- I did a show in the past.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.920]   I think it was called You're 100% Responsible for Your Income, which is kind of funny.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:15.360]   It seems to be one of the more popular shows of the ones that I recorded a year ago.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.760]   It was one of those that I just sat down and just dashed off in a day.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.480]   And I'm kind of embarrassed of its popularity because I just sat it down and just did it
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.640]   off the top of my head.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:29.000]   But that was one of the most listened to episodes of the show.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.480]   But in that -- I believe it was in that episode, I talked about the importance of increasing
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.040]   your income, of compounding your income.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.080]   And I talked about Brian Tracy's 1000% formula.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:44.000]   And the fundamental idea behind the 1000% formula is that if you'll focus on compounding
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.280]   -- on growing your income at a compounding rate, you can do some amazingly amazing things
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.800]   with your wages.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.440]   And so let me run some numbers here.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.560]   Let me give you an example.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.360]   So what I'll do is I'm going to just use a financial calculator, which by the way, if
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.440]   you're not familiar with using one, get good at one because you can answer all these questions
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.300]   like this yourself in about 10 seconds.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.640]   So let's just show how compounding works with income.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:14.440]   So what I'm going to do is I'm going to apply an annual compounding rate to a level of income.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:20.560]   So let's start -- let's say that we have a 25-year-old just starting their life.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.160]   And let's say that just coming out of college -- and actually I'm going to play with some
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.160]   of these scenarios.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.400]   So we have a 25-year-old just coming out of college.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:32.000]   And this 25-year-old takes an entry-level job making, let's just say, $40,000 a year.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.260]   At least 40 because it's easier for me to remember as my number.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:39.440]   So we're going to put in $40,000 as our starting value.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.520]   And let's compound this over 40 years.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.000]   So we're going to put a 40-year time period in.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.600]   We're not going to put any payments in.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.460]   And we're going to -- let's just use a 3% annual compounding rate.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:27:00.560]   If you'll start at $40,000 and you'll compound your income at 3%, then at 65, when you retire
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:07.240]   -- just stick with this scenario -- when you retire, you would be earning $130,481 per
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.840]   year.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.040]   And that 3%, that would be about an inflation rate.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:20.400]   Now if you can bump that up to a 4%, and look at the difference, now you're earning $192,000
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.400]   that final year.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.860]   That's an extra $60,000.
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.700]   But remember, that's in one year.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.720]   So that was an extra $60,000 at 65.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.760]   It was probably an extra -- I could go and make the chart, but I'm not going to do it.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.880]   But it was probably an extra $59,000 at 64.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.600]   And an extra $57,000 at 63.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.160]   And an extra -- you get my point.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.640]   That's an extra hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:48.520]   Now let's say that you could compound your income at something like 7%.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:53.240]   Well now at 65, just the difference between -- actually, that one's too scary.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.760]   Let's go back to 6%.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:02.160]   So if you could double that compounding rate, and you could go from earning 3% per year
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.080]   to earning 6% per year increases.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.640]   You would go from earning $135,000 a year at 65.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:15.080]   So we're going from 40 to 135 in the first example, 3%.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:23.500]   You would go from earning $40,000 a year to earning $411,000 at age 65 each year.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:30.700]   So now at age 65, you've got an extra $250,000.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.920]   And at 64, you had an extra $230,000.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.280]   And at 63, you had an extra $220,000.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:40.360]   And at 62, you had an extra $210,000, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.160]   So if you're really looking for the most powerful thing that you can compound, forget about
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.960]   the investments.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.480]   Focus on the income.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:56.360]   Because just the growth from 3% to 6% -- growth from 3% to 6% -- that is an incredible difference
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.200]   between $130,000 and $411,000.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.280]   Now, could you do 6%?
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.880]   I think anybody could do 6% if they want to do.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:12.320]   I think that -- remember, with Brian Tracy's formula, which to me makes all the sense in
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:17.240]   the world, you're going to be increasing your income at 26% annually.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.960]   And what would that mean?
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.360]   Let's just do -- I wonder if this will break the calculator.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:28.320]   If I put in 26% annually, then that means that you're earning $413 million a year at
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   age 65.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.400]   Now, you say, "That's not possible," right?
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.640]   But are there not people who have done that?
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.800]   There are people who are earning $413 million a year.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.480]   Now, maybe the formula does break down.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.560]   I think that is kind of a dramatic example.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.800]   But 10% per year?
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.640]   Now we're at $1.8 million a year?
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.840]   Look at the difference of no matter where you start.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:57.400]   If starting at 25, no matter where you start, just earning $40,000 just by focusing on compounding
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.960]   your income, compounding your inflows.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   So what do you need to do?
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.920]   I think you probably need to enhance your skills.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.160]   Because we're paid exactly what we're worth in the marketplace.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:13.280]   On a financial basis, the income that you earn right now is exactly the appropriate
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.520]   income to what you should be earning based upon the skills that you're bringing to the
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.080]   marketplace.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.600]   So the only way to change that income is to increase your skills and to enhance the value.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.480]   And then to find somebody, find the marketplace and the marketplace, whether that's a new
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:33.240]   employer or whether that's the customers that value what you've created, to find somebody
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:38.200]   who values that so that you can command a higher wage to earn higher inflows.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.600]   So I would say it means increasing your skills.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.160]   And whether that's simple things like reading books in your field, attending conferences
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.040]   in your field, reading your industry magazines so you understand what's going on in your
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:54.800]   field, listening to the podcasts in your field, learning how to speak in public and speaking
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.440]   at the industry conferences in your field.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.880]   And whether that means those things, whether it's field knowledge, whether that means enhancing
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:09.640]   your personal skills such as increasing your emotional intelligence, increasing your communication
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.740]   skills, learning how to inspire people, learning how to lead people, learning how to help other
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.120]   people be more effective.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:22.000]   Whether that means changing industries, whether that means changing employers.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:29.680]   You see these stories from time to time that come across and they say how much more somebody
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:34.000]   makes by transitioning from one employer to the next.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.520]   If you want a 30% raise, it's probably easier to find a different employer and then negotiate
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:44.240]   a 30% raise with that different employer than it is to get your current employer to give
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.680]   you a 30% raise in a year if they're accustomed to giving you 3% raises.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:54.160]   So this is how we affect the size of inflows, just one idea of many.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.640]   Now you could also address the characteristics of inflows.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.720]   So characteristics of inflows may be the characteristics of your job.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.940]   Do you work a job that's agreeable to you?
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.440]   Are you working in a field that's agreeable to you?
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.640]   Are you working in an industry that you care about, that you like?
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.240]   Is there a need to change to another industry?
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.880]   Do you work in an industry that you don't like that -- well, if you work in an industry
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.200]   that you don't like, you might as well go work in another industry that you don't like
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.040]   and then go and get paid more for it.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.800]   Or can you switch from the industry that you like -- excuse me, that you don't like to
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.720]   an industry that you like even if you need to have a pay cut?
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   That's fine.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.720]   It's your decision.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.760]   There's nothing wrong with reducing the number.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.000]   There's nothing wrong with it.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.760]   But understand it because you're probably -- if you're working in an industry that you're
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.720]   more interested in, it's probably going to be easier for you to compound that number
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:51.360]   than it would be if you were -- than it would be if you were working in an industry that
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.440]   you didn't care for.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.440]   And then leverage.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.240]   How can you apply leverage to your income formula?
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:03.040]   Well, maybe the leverage that you could apply was the financial leverage to borrow money
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:07.960]   on student loans so that instead of making $40,000 out of school, you made $80,000.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:13.920]   So let's reset this as $80,000 and now let's run our 3% inflation rate, our 3% growth of
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.920]   income.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.160]   Well, if you start at $80,000 -- I did something wrong.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.960]   Okay, there we go.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:27.280]   So if you start at $80,000 and you can grow your wealth -- you can grow your income at
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:33.960]   3%, now by starting at $80,000, now that final year you're earning $260,000.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.800]   So remember, we're measuring this against our $40,000 base mark and this would make
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:42.960]   sense because we're intuitively -- we have intuitively doubled the salary.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:47.600]   So what we've done is we've applied, you know, some sort of financial leverage maybe to build
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.800]   -- to get a degree in a field that is financially rewarding.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.880]   We've applied financial leverage and we've doubled our income every year going forward.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:03.240]   That's why the college financial numbers are so difficult to escape is that, you know,
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:08.840]   if you can double from $40,000 to $80,000, that's a doubling every single year.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.400]   So even if you had to borrow $100,000, you know, just do this math in your head.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:18.800]   If you had to borrow $100,000 for a college degree but you came out making $80,000 instead
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:24.360]   of $40,000 and even though my first example I imagined that you did have a degree, imagine
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:30.240]   now that you don't and imagine that the $40,000 was for the non-college graduate, well, the
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.240]   difference in earning power would be $40,000 per year.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:39.520]   So 40, 80, 120, take out some taxes, let's say three years you've broken even on your
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.240]   investment in that degree.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:47.440]   And then every year from then on, you now can command a higher salary if you learn something
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.520]   in school and you can deliver on that.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.680]   So that may be one thing.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:56.800]   You may be able to apply some sort of financial leverage through the form of a loan.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.440]   You may be able to apply some other kind of synthetic leverage.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:05.360]   So for example, could you work in an industry or in a field where you could apply some kind
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.480]   of synthetic equity or other leverage to the field?
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:15.720]   So maybe you don't have the money here to, you would really love to make your business,
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:21.760]   you would really love to earn your money and build your business based upon managing rental
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:26.040]   units that you operate for yourself.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.160]   But the reality is you don't have any money to pay for those rental units.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:33.520]   Well, can you go out and find some other people who already have rental units and hire yourself
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.360]   on as a property manager?
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:40.680]   And then now you're leveraging their $100,000 investment and you're just taking a 10% cut
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.680]   of the rents.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.800]   So this would be a good way to apply leverage to your inflows.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.820]   So consider that.
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:52.960]   Consider if changing the size, how can you change the size and the characteristic of
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.960]   your inflows?
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.960]   What are your personal likes?
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.000]   Are you working in a field that's best suited for your skills?
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.720]   Optimize both of those factors and optimize the inflows.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:07.320]   Now the ultimate optimization might be to get to the point where your investment inflows
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.480]   are higher than your salary inflows.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.160]   I think this is really the ultimate optimization.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.480]   This is what financial independence truly is, is when the dividends and increases from
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:23.720]   the companies that you own are higher than your outflows.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.640]   Well now you are financially independent.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.920]   What a beautiful place to be in.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:33.600]   So now we're addressing the size and the characteristic of our inflows.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:40.280]   So if you have that as a set target, that my goal is to build my assets to the point
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.080]   where my investment inflows are higher than my personal outflows, if you have that as
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.920]   a goal, you'll reach it.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.160]   Most people don't have that as a goal.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.440]   They've never considered that it's even possible because they never even consider
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:55.240]   that there's anything to do other than work as a salary.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.800]   So move on to outflows.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.880]   Optimize the outflows.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:04.160]   So here again, you're going to adjust the size and the characteristic of the outflows.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.720]   So the size, are there any outflows you could easily cut?
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.360]   Could you just simply say, I don't want to spend that money anymore.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.320]   I'm not gaining value from that.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.160]   I'm not gaining value from-- I don't know what to pick on.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.320]   I'm just not gaining value from this category of expenses.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.640]   I'm going to remove it from my life.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:26.640]   Now, then again, could you say, well, I'd like to go ahead and spend money in this category,
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.160]   but could I optimize it in some way?
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:36.480]   Instead of spending money on rent to a non-family member, could I rent from a family member?
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.500]   So at least then I'm benefiting a family member in this transaction.
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:46.560]   Instead of paying for food that is raised in a way that I don't think is appropriate,
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.480]   can I buy food from sources that I do want to support?
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:54.400]   Can I allocate my outflows in a way that support my values?
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.360]   So can you optimize the size of the outflows?
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.560]   And this is where skills planning comes in.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.760]   That's what Jacob talks a lot about in his early retirement extreme book.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:11.120]   Can you adjust and bring in the skill advantage to reduce the amount of outflows that are
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.160]   necessary?
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:17.080]   So whether this is something as simple as clipping coupons for your favorite breakfast
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:25.080]   cereal to as complex as a comprehensive income tax plan to shelter the majority of your money
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:29.800]   from income taxes, all of this is about optimizing outflows.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.560]   And you have to optimize outflows in order to build wealth.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.800]   You have to optimize them.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.720]   You have to have lower outflows than inflows in order to build the surplus.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:44.820]   Not going to be possible for you to get rich and build real wealth if that's not the case.
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.920]   But your plan is going to be your plan.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.440]   So don't buy this nonsense that some people say, ah, don't worry about expenses.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.440]   Expenses don't matter.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.440]   Expenses matter.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.000]   And they matter a lot at the beginning.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.800]   They matter a ton at the beginning.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:04.360]   I'm planning a show-- and maybe this week, it may not be-- but I'm planning a show on
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.480]   the concept of new cars, used cars.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:13.320]   I don't want to destroy this myth about the new car versus the used car for wealth building.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:21.280]   But one of the key things that's going to be a component of that show is to understand
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.700]   when this matters.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:26.680]   If you're at the beginning of your career and you buy a $30,000 car that depreciates
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:32.760]   in value by 15%, that is a huge-- each year, that is a huge number.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:38.680]   That's $4,500 of depreciation this year.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:46.640]   That's an expense-- excuse me-- it's a massive expense that is very difficult for a small
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:50.680]   budget to recover from.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:57.480]   Now on the other hand, if you're 70 years old and you've got a multimillion dollar income,
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.920]   does $4,500 of depreciation matter that much?
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.140]   It really doesn't.
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:07.680]   So the key is to understand how big are these numbers in a relative fashion to your specific
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.640]   cash flow statement, to your specific outflows.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:20.440]   And then can you apply the ideas of leverage and compounding-- can you apply the ideas
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.160]   to any of the outflows?
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:31.560]   So for example, compounding-- can you lower the outflows by doing better tax planning?
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.280]   Because of the fact-- for example, investing in an IRA.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   Let's say that you want to invest $5,000 through an IRA.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.320]   Well, you can leverage this by-- let me stop, sorry.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.280]   Let's say that you want to invest $5,000.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.440]   You can leverage this by leveraging through an IRA.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:58.100]   So then let's say that at your tax rate, maybe you have to earn $6,500 to be able to pay
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.880]   taxes and then invest in a taxable account with the $5,000.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:07.560]   Well, a good way to apply leveraging here would be to go ahead and put the money into
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.760]   an IRA.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.520]   And then you can gain as it goes up.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.840]   And what you can get-- my example breaks down because I'm combining two concepts, and I
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.840]   hope it makes sense.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.240]   I recognize this is not mathematically perfect.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:26.280]   But you can get-- in essence, you get to experience by leveraging the tax savings, you get to
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:33.680]   compound not only your original investment, but also the savings on the taxes.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.640]   And you get to compound what you would have had to pay otherwise.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:42.520]   So you get to compound not only your original investment, but an example-- I shouldn't have
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.520]   used $5,000.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.840]   I should use, say, $3,000, and you've got to invest $4,500.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.800]   So now you can invest on the tax savings and your original principal.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.920]   And that can compound over time.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.680]   And that's a tremendous leverage point that you can look for.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.360]   And this can be applied in every area.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:05.000]   Can you leverage your good relationships with your neighbors to share a Wi-Fi signal between
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.200]   each other so that one of you doesn't have to pay for the full thing when you've got
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.200]   a perfectly good signal coming in right across the street?
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:17.440]   Can you leverage your county library system so that you spend less money at the bookstore?
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.600]   Can you leverage-- I mean, there's a variety of things.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.400]   And everything is going to come down to adjusting the size of the outflows and then optimizing
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.760]   those outflows.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.640]   And then finally, we get to the surplus.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:36.560]   And we get to the point of saying, well, how can I affect the rate of return, the size
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:41.720]   of the surplus-- excuse me-- the rate of return that I get, which is the size that it will
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.720]   grow at?
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.560]   And I'm trying to stay consistent with my size and characteristics.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.640]   But this one is different.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.600]   So how can I adjust the rate of return that I'm earning on the surplus?
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.760]   And how can I adjust the characteristics of my investments?
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.400]   So if we think of it in that way, then we're constantly going to be applying our lens to
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.720]   say, well, I have surplus.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.880]   What's going to be the best use of this surplus at this point in time?
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:11.960]   And so the best use of this surplus at this point in time may be at one point in time
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:16.560]   going to college and paying for the college tuition fees so that I can increase my income
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.920]   if that's the reason that I'm going to college.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.600]   At another time, it may be I went shopping.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:27.080]   And my wife and I eat scrambled eggs and sausage every morning for breakfast.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.880]   And the sausage was on sale.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:34.040]   And I bought eight-- I think I bought eight packages of sausage.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.600]   Because I don't know when the next sale comes around.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.320]   I figure it comes around at least every couple months.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.160]   And we probably eat a package a week.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.360]   So at least then I got a couple months worth of sausage in the refrigerator.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:47.320]   So maybe something as simple as saying, I'm going to make sure that I spend my surplus
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:52.120]   on the things that I'm going to use anyway and get them when they're at a price leading
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.000]   discount.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.560]   And so this is one of the major areas.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:03.280]   If you study how to save on groceries, this would be one of the major things that you
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.280]   can do, buy on sale.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.360]   Well, you have to have cash to be able to buy on sale.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:11.360]   So it may be every bit as appropriate for me to say, I'm going to use my surplus.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.520]   I'm going to do that and stock up on food when it's cheap.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.780]   Or I'm going to use my surplus and I'm going to buy stock when they're cheap.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:24.360]   Or I'm going to use my surplus to do insulation in my attic, to install energy saving screens
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.320]   on my windows to lower my air conditioning bill, or whatever you guys do up north where
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.320]   it's cold.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.320]   I don't know what you do.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.680]   Or maybe buy a wood stove or put in better windows to have solar again.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.760]   I don't know what you guys do up there.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:44.960]   So whatever it is, I can apply the same thinking as saying, how can I optimize the surplus?
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.080]   How can I optimize the rate of return that I'm earning on the surplus?
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.200]   Now notice how the rate of return that I'm earning on the surplus is going to come back
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.000]   over and affect my inflows.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:03.800]   So let's say that my decision is, Joshua, you say that since the history of well-run
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.280]   equities markets, they've generally returned 10%.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.280]   But you know what?
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   That's not good enough for me.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.480]   How can I do better?
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.180]   Well maybe have a business idea.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:19.200]   So a business idea, a good business idea, may easily make far more than 10%.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:24.920]   And so this would be where I could, if I ran my calculations, just for fun I will here,
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:25.920]   let's say I have $40,000.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.760]   This is my earning income.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:30.400]   And let's say I had a goal.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:36.600]   Let's put this in as $40,000 present value, no payments, 3% growth over 40 years.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:43.280]   So 3% growth over 40 years comes out to be $130,000 of income.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.680]   So let's say you said, well, 10%, I want to compound that at more.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.680]   Where can I do that?
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.140]   Probably in your own business.
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:54.160]   So the right investment in your own business, where you can apply leveraging and compounding
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.400]   and unique skill and knowledge, and if the business is successful, could increase your
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.120]   income at a massive percentage rate.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.240]   Maybe it could be 10,000%.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:07.320]   That's the way that you go from the $40,000 incomes to the $4 million incomes.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.720]   It's in your own business.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.880]   You don't get that working in middle management.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:16.640]   You don't make $4 million working in middle management at a medium-sized company.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:23.520]   You get that by becoming the CEO of a large public traded company, or you get it by starting
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:30.760]   a local scrap dealer, a local plumbing company that you grow to be a bunch of trucks.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:35.240]   So I don't want to repeat anything that I've said.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.000]   So I think this is about all I've got on this topic.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.520]   But I guess I just want to point out to me, the cash flow statement and the balance sheet
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.920]   are beautiful, because they illustrate everything that I can do.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.960]   And for you, they will illustrate everything that you can do.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.880]   And somehow, maybe I should figure out a way to sell this a little bit better.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.840]   But you don't need to listen to my show every day.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.520]   All you would do is create a cash flow statement and a balance sheet, and look at it and say,
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:06.160]   how can I optimize the size and the characteristic of these inflows, outflows, and the rate of
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.280]   return that I'm earning on my surplus?
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.840]   That's it.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.120]   Those are the only three, maybe six levers that you have to do.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.560]   But that's what ultimately everything's going to come from.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.240]   Now are there other financial planning things?
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:18.240]   Yes.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.240]   Well, how does insurance play into it?
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.800]   Well, insurance is protecting my inflows, or it's protecting my outflows.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.440]   So if I'm-- Sam, I mentioned disability insurance.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:32.480]   So if I'm buying disability insurance, I'm buying disability insurance so that if my
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:37.040]   inflows are interrupted due to disability, that I can replace those inflows from the
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.460]   insurance policy.
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:43.320]   If I'm buying property and casualty insurance, a fire policy on my house, I'm protecting
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:49.520]   myself so that if my house is disrupted, I'm protecting my budget from the need to come
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:53.560]   up with an extra $200,000 to rebuild my house as an outflow.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:58.760]   So it all works in on this calculation and on this formula.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.200]   I find this to be useful.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.880]   I hope that you also find it to be useful.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:07.680]   To me, it kind of dispels a lot of the differentiation that everyone's trying to constantly say,
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.680]   look, I'm different.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.080]   And I'm just like, you're not different.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.080]   You're focusing on inflows.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.560]   You're, ah, you're focusing on outflows.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.560]   I got it.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.200]   Ah, you're working on an investment trick here.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.880]   OK, I see this.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:22.000]   And so there's a dramatic, there are dramatic gains that can be made by seeing these things
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.880]   comprehensively.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:29.440]   And my wish is that we all started to view everything we do in a comprehensive manner
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:36.120]   and that we all were able to think these things through and help one another by thinking comprehensively.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:41.480]   I also just want to free you from the idea that this stuff is set in stone for you.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.480]   It's not.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.480]   You can choose.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.480]   You can choose to change.
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.480]   You can choose to adjust.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.680]   You can choose to affect any of these variables that you want to affect.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:54.240]   I had an idea earlier, and I think I've got a moment to do it.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.440]   Let me just take a second and adjust this.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.240]   And let me show how, you know, you can have the choice.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.800]   So I was using earlier $40,000 as my proxy income.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.200]   So let me just put this in here.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.800]   $40,000 is my income.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:11.000]   But instead of starting at age 25, let's say someone starts earning at age 18.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.920]   And so they start earning at 18.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:17.800]   And so now my number of years from instead of 25 to 65, instead of 40 years, it's going
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.280]   to be 47 years.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:27.720]   Well, at 65, this person is now earning $160,000 instead of the $130,000 that the person starting
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.640]   at 25 was doing.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:36.400]   So this would be, if we were doing a rational college calculation, if we were doing a college
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.960]   calculation and we discovered that our starting wage out of college was going to be $40,000,
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.440]   but we could get a starting wage prior to college of $40,000, then we would need to
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.520]   factor in the seven years of lost productivity.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.280]   And I know that's a little aggressive.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.920]   It should be four or five years.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:57.000]   But my point is that the extra seven years of compounding resulted in an extra $30,000
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.400]   of wages at 65.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.960]   So, you know, but you have the choice.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.180]   So what if you compound instead of at 3%?
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:09.040]   You started at 4%, and you started at 18, and you said, OK, I'm going to compound at
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.040]   6%.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:15.040]   Well, now at 65, we've got $618,000 a year.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.840]   Let's say you put this at 8%.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.440]   Now at 65, we've got $1.5 million a year.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:25.360]   So there's amazing differences that can be had.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.720]   I don't know which of those things are going to work for you.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.040]   If you're 18, pay attention to those numbers.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:34.480]   If you're 48, that's not a lot of help to you.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:38.480]   But make your financial statements, and you'll still be able to figure out what will actually
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.520]   work for you.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.800]   So I think that's most of what I want to share on this topic.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:48.640]   And I do have one more idea, and then I'll leave you with a challenge.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:53.960]   Remember that we're only really here talking about the financial statements.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:57.040]   And there are a lot of other non-financial statements.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.360]   There's a lot of other aspects of life that is non-financial.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:05.280]   You know, a good question should be, as far as if we have a surplus, how should we-- how
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.200]   should we-- [MUMBLING]
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.160]   How should we reinvest the surplus?
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:15.080]   Should we save it in the bank, or should we move our family across town to a better neighborhood
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   or across the world?
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:20.760]   Now, that's going to convert it into an outflow, so it's not a surplus any longer.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:29.080]   But maybe, should we use the surplus to adopt a child and invest into the life of that child?
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.560]   Or should we use it to buy a van we can use for our side business?
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.640]   Or whatever the options are.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:42.240]   Remember that it's not going to be, ultimately, the money things that any of us are really
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:48.220]   going to look back on and count most dear.
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:53.320]   There may be a few of us that look back fondly and maybe view a certificate of stock that
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:59.200]   was our first stock we ever bought, or that we keep some memento of our past financial
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:03.360]   goings on, whether that was the mortgage cancellation notice of our debt.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:08.120]   But most of us are going to have a wall full of family pictures.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:11.640]   And we're going to have those non-financial things that matter.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.560]   And that's what we're going to be focusing on.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.480]   The great things in life are really not that expensive.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.480]   I've been blessed.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.480]   I'm sometimes shocked.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:22.880]   My wife and I just talk about what an amazing life we live.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:30.760]   And I'm not saying that in a-- what's the word that means--
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:35.840]   there's a word that means excessive.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:41.640]   I'm not saying that in some kind of-- anyway, I'm not saying that to-- it's true.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.120]   We live an amazing life.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.760]   It's really not that expensive.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.000]   There's a beautiful sunset wherever you are.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:55.200]   And the beautiful sunset is really no more beautiful from the $30 million mansion as
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.880]   from the public beach next door.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:03.960]   So just consider those things, is that the great things in life are really not that expensive.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.320]   They're really not.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:12.160]   And consider how can you optimize not just the size, but also the-- not just the amounts,
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:18.800]   but also the categories and the characteristics of all the inflows and outflows.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.820]   And my challenge for you is this.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:24.520]   And I just remembered, I want to play a piece of audio for you before I go.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:29.200]   In fact, I'm just going to end with that audio and I'm not going to play the closing music.
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.200]   So stay tuned.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:34.480]   It's about a three-minute audio from Jim Rohn, who was just an amazing-- had an amazing ability
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:39.600]   to put things into-- to make-- turn words into poetry and turn them into poetry that
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.760]   affected people's actions.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:44.760]   He's certainly been a huge help to me over the years and I want to honor his legacy and
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:48.160]   just play a moment-- a three-minute audio clip.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.320]   But I'll give you a challenge.
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.840]   If you haven't done these financial statements, I know that this is not generally the type
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.840]   of stuff that's done in financial podcasts.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.800]   But I really believe that this is a really useful tool.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.400]   And if you haven't done this, just create these for yourself.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.840]   Create a simple balance sheet and create a simple cash flow statement.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.260]   But here's the key.
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:09.460]   Don't just create it and then just, you know, tuck it away in a drawer.
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:17.400]   Look at it and ask yourself if it's reflecting your values and if it's reflecting what you're
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:18.440]   doing.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:22.440]   And give it some time with kind of a-- I don't know, maybe a journaling exercise to
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.640]   sit down and say, you know, what can I do?
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.920]   How can I optimize my inflows?
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.000]   And are they optimized?
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.280]   What could I do to increase them substantially?
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.280]   Or pick a category.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.380]   If it's outflows, you can go through every category of your budget here.
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:42.080]   And sometimes, you may wind yourself-- you may wind up-- excuse me.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:46.920]   May wind up in a perspective where you are doing a fancy financial planning tool.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.480]   You're doing a fancy tax plan or something like that.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:52.720]   The stuff that I'll talk about more, you know, more on this show.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:57.560]   Or it might be that you're just saying, "Why am I paying money for this car that I just
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.240]   don't care about?
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.880]   Why am I paying money for this thing?
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.880]   I'm going to do something different.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.880]   I'm going to sell it and move to another neighborhood."
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:06.880]   I just challenge you.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:10.680]   You can coach yourself through this stuff once you have the statement in front of you.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:15.120]   And look, in your situation, I want to talk about lots more ideas, but how can you apply
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:20.840]   leverage and compounding in all of the right ways without all of the negative ways?
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:25.120]   So get rid of the compounding credit card debt that's compounding against you.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:30.520]   And start compounding your income at a higher rate than it's ever been compounded at.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:38.120]   And try to apply some sort of synthetic leverage to your-- some categories of your expenses.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:41.080]   You know, people do this with-- just another example of what I mean is like with travel
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:46.640]   hacking, where people say, "Well, I'm going to go ahead and use-- I've got to buy money,
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:51.640]   but I'll use airlines credit cards, and I'll buy all these free mile programs.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:56.680]   And now I'm going to leverage my skill with this to get more money for the dollar than
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:01.400]   I would otherwise have gotten."
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.840]   So I hope that you'll do that.
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.840]   I hope that you'll do that.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.160]   Oh, and the last thing, I almost forgot.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.160]   I wanted to mention about the shows on Thursday and Friday.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.280]   I hope you enjoy that.
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:18.960]   I tried to bring a little bit of-- I enjoyed the Alan Watts audio, and then also the talk
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.520]   from Cal Newport.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.640]   And just want to point out one thing about the Cal Newport.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.240]   I think it's a valuable balance.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:31.680]   But notice that there's nothing in those two talks that is contradictory of one another.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.160]   Is that you really do have to build skill.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.320]   You know, Cal was right.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.320]   But you know what?
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:41.600]   If you want to just say, I want to do what I'm passionate about and ignore the skill,
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:45.480]   if you're willing to forego the potential financial loss, there's no reason why you
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:47.120]   can't make that choice.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.800]   And what annoys me about a lot of things-- and I'm sure Cal would-- I've never spoken
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.800]   to him.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:55.360]   I'm sure he would admit it-- is that we generally only hear of the rich people.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.360]   But you know what?
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.720]   There are a lot of people who don't have a lot of money.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.000]   They're not Steve Jobs.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.560]   So they're not speaking at college graduation commencement ceremonies.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.400]   But they are living the lifestyle of their dreams.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:13.420]   And they're doing it through the application of skill.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:17.940]   So as Cal said, if you have 10 interests, pick one and get really good at it and build
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:18.940]   skill at it.
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:20.080]   But you know what?
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.200]   If you do know what you're passionate about, figure out a plan to get there.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:32.080]   That's what this show is about, is having a customized plan that's really going to
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.680]   help you to get there.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.680]   So that's the show.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.240]   Stay tuned for the Jim Rohn audio.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.520]   I hope that you've enjoyed it.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:41.280]   Thank you for those of you who've been leaving reviews for the show on iTunes.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.520]   I'm sorry that I've been sick.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:44.120]   I'm doing the best I can today.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:47.120]   But if this show fell flat, give me a little bit of mercy.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:52.520]   But I'll do my best to keep on coming back this week with world-class financial planning
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:53.520]   content.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:54.760]   And I just challenge you.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.160]   Do something with this show.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.240]   Create those two financial statements for yourself.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.240]   And start watching them.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:02.520]   And start coaching yourself through every one of your decisions.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.840]   Enjoy the rest of your Monday.
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.680]   First question is one of the major questions of the world.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.000]   Why?
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   Why should you try?
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.280]   Why read that many books?
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:13.520]   Why go that far?
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.520]   Why earn that much?
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.560]   Why share that much?
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:17.300]   Why learn all that?
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:18.440]   Why get up that early?
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.960]   Why put yourself through that much?
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.800]   Why try for all that?
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:22.800]   Good question.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:23.800]   Why?
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:28.720]   One of the best answers to why is the second question.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.100]   Why not?
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:34.780]   What else are you going to do with your life?
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:36.440]   Why not see how many books you can read?
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:37.440]   How far you can go?
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:38.440]   How much you can earn?
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.280]   How many friends you can make?
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:41.960]   How much personality you can develop?
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.280]   Influence you can have?
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.520]   How many things you can accomplish?
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.160]   How far you can go and what you can see?
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:49.420]   Why not?
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:53.320]   You got to stay here till you go.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:55.780]   Why not?
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:59:00.920]   The third question is why not you?
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:01.920]   Why not you?
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:07.560]   Some people have done the most incredible things with limited start.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:09.120]   Why not you?
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.120]   Some people have done so well.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:11.120]   They get to go.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.120]   They get to see it all.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.120]   They get to do it.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.120]   They get to be there.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.900]   They get to have it.
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:17.000]   They get to enjoy it.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.640]   Why not you?
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:28.000]   Why not you watching the morning mist rise over the mountains of Scotland?
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.200]   Exploring the mysteries of Spain, soaking up history in London.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.640]   Why not you?
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:38.320]   You got to take a stroll through the palace of Versailles.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.200]   Why not you?
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:46.080]   You got to have lunch in one of those neat little sidewalk cafes in Paris.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:51.760]   I mean, Denny's is okay, but you got to try Paris.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:58.560]   Someday you got to gaze directly at the Mona Lisa.
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:04.880]   I can show you where to find the most exquisite seashells in Miami and the Bahamas.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.600]   I know where they are.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.380]   Why not you?
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:13.240]   You got to shop on Fifth Avenue in New York.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:18.040]   You got to stay at the Waldorf Astoria.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.040]   Have dinner at Lou Chow's.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:25.880]   Slice roast goose on a bed of apple stew.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.760]   Why not you?
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.480]   You got to drink in an Arizona sunset.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.680]   You got to see the world.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.400]   You got to read the books.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.160]   You got to do the enterprises.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:41.460]   You got to be involved in commerce and love and travel and experiences.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.560]   You got to do it all.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.920]   Why not you?
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.080]   You got to know the results that come from splendid discipline.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:53.560]   There's nothing like a view from the top.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:58.760]   And the last question is, why not now?
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:03.840]   Don't postpone your better future any longer.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.420]   Get at it tomorrow with new vigor.
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:15.200]   Start to make changes, have conversations, make contact, and do it now.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:41.600]   And if you will, I have a feeling one of these days we'll be hearing your story.
