[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Don't just believe that it's because something is trendy that it's good.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   I probably go the other extreme where if I find too many people
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   adopting a certain idea, I probably think it's wrong.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Or if my work had become too popular, I probably would think I had to change.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   This is, of course, ridiculous, but I see the other side of it too often
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   where people will do something against their own gut instincts
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   because they think the community wants them to do it that way.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   So people will work on a certain subject even though they aren't terribly interested in it
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   because they think that they'll get more prestige by working on it.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I think you get more prestige by doing good science than by doing popular science
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   because if you go with what you really think is important,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   then there's a higher chance that it really is important in the long run.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And it's the long run which has the most benefit to the world.
