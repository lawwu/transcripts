[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.840]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter and the sixteenth verse.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.040]   The sixteenth verse in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:30.960]   And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.880]   There is a perfect summary of the whole of the Christian position.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:43.960]   That is one of the best, if not the best definition of a Christian that one can ever encounter.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.080]   A Christian is a man who has received of the fullness of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.400]   of God.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.080]   And we've been studying this great statement in order to try to discover something of the
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.800]   riches and of the depth and the profundity of what it has to give us.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.600]   The Christian is not merely a man who believes.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.840]   He is not merely a man who has had an experience.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.600]   He is a man who is receiving, literally receiving of the fullness that is in the Son of God,
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.920]   our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.240]   And we've been looking at the different aspects of this great matter.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:33.680]   Now what's occupying us at the moment is the way in which this fullness that is in
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.240]   him and that he has made available for us actually becomes ours.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.320]   And we are there regarding as perhaps the most perfect summary of that statement in
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.160]   1 Corinthians 1.30.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:59.880]   Of him, of God, are ye Christians in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.000]   righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   You see, he is everything.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.320]   He is the Alpha and the Omega.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.200]   He is the beginning and the end, first and last.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.520]   We are complete in him.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.840]   And therefore it is important that we should realize how these different aspects of the
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.640]   fullness are made available to us.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.640]   And now we are considering this whole question of Christ made unto us sanctification and
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.840]   the various ways in which that happens.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.320]   Sanctification is this great process which begins from the moment of regeneration and
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.560]   which goes on until our ultimate glorification.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.000]   It is this process in which we are being made more and more conformable unto the image and
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.840]   the pattern of the Son of God.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.280]   And as we have been seeing, it is a work that is done mainly by the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.180]   He was sent, the Holy Spirit was sent by the Father and the Son in order to mediate unto
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.080]   us this fullness that is in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.920]   That is his chief work.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.160]   He does many other things.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.640]   He has gifts to give to men, spiritual gifts, but that is secondary.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.520]   The primary object of his coming is that he may glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.040]   And he does that by mediating him to us.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.480]   It is he who baptizes us into Christ.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.520]   It is he who brings to us the graces of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.800]   And so we have been considering his great work in leading us, guiding us to the Scriptures,
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.880]   anointing our understanding, leading us in prayer, and all the many, many-sided operations
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.440]   of the Holy Spirit, what the New Testament calls the communion of the Holy Spirit, the
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:06.880]   partnership of the Holy Spirit, our participation with him in the life of our blessed Lord and
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880]   Saviour.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.480]   Well now then, that is the background to what we are to consider this morning.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:22.520]   You see, the theme is the various ways in which Christ is formed in us, the ways in
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.000]   which we have built up in him, the way in which we grow in grace and in the knowledge
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.080]   of the Lord.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.360]   That is sanctification.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.040]   Now then, we come to a subject this morning which is of very vital importance in this
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.720]   very connection, and that is the whole question of the sacraments.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.440]   The sacrament of the Lord's Supper, the sacrament of baptism.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.080]   Now these are of vital importance, and particularly the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, in connection
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.680]   with the whole matter of our sanctification.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.400]   That is why they were appointed, appointed by the Lord himself.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:12.920]   And he appointed them in order that they might play their part in this great process of sanctification,
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.720]   of Christ being made unto us our sanctification.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.960]   Now I need scarcely say that it is not only a very important and vital subject, but one
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:34.040]   which throughout the centuries has been found difficult in many respects by God's people.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.640]   I suppose that there has been greater controversy over the question of the sacraments than perhaps
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.960]   over any single item in the whole of the Christian position.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.760]   And of course at the present time this is of supreme importance.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.400]   With all the talk about ecumenicity, and all the talk about a rapprochement with the Church
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.520]   of Rome, and so on, this subject of course is of crucial importance, because in many
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:12.640]   ways one of the greatest causes of division between Roman Catholicism and true Protestantism
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.480]   is this whole question of the sacraments, as I am now going to try to show you.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.540]   So this is an important subject from every standpoint.
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.800]   We are interested primarily in it from the standpoint of our practical sanctification.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.720]   But as I say, we must be interested in it also from that larger standpoint.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   Well now then, how do we best approach this whole matter?
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.360]   I do not want to go too much in general into the question of sacraments.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.400]   It is not exactly germane to my immediate object at the moment, and yet it is good that
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:01.320]   we should hold certain general principles in our mind.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.520]   The Roman Catholic Church recognizes seven sacraments, talks about and teaches that there
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.520]   are seven sacraments.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:19.920]   The sacrament of baptism, the sacrament of confirmation, the sacrament of the Lord's
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:28.400]   Supper, the sacrament of ordination into the ministry, the sacrament of marriage, the sacrament
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.600]   of penance, the sacrament of what they call the Last Unction.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.200]   They recognize those seven sacraments.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.600]   Now I am not going to take your time over that, but I am simply reporting the fact to
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:48.640]   you because it is, as I say, in the present situation particularly important that we should
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.800]   know that they regard those as sacraments, every one of them.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   Well now, Protestantism recognizes only two sacraments, and they are baptism and the Lord's
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   Supper.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.280]   And the reason for that is that we say, and we say that the Bible says, the New Testament
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:11.800]   says that those are the only two that are appointed by the Lord himself and clearly
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.120]   taught in the scriptures.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.720]   There is no evidence here that any of the others are sacraments at all.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.520]   Indeed, they are later additions brought in by the Roman Church, as she has done in so
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.200]   many other respects during the passage of the centuries.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   Very well.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.840]   Now then, the question is, what is a sacrament?
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.400]   And how does it work?
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.960]   What do we do when we come, for instance, to this table and take of the bread and of
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.960]   the wine?
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.600]   Here is something that we do in this church twice every month, others do it every Sunday,
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.640]   others do it two or three times a year only.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.720]   But what does it mean?
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.720]   What are we doing?
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.280]   Why do we do it at all?
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:09:00.480]   Now this is the sort of question that we should always be facing, and particularly, as I say,
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.600]   with its bearing upon the whole question of our sanctification.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   Now there are those who hold the view that this is simply a kind of commemorative act.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:20.680]   That was a view which was taught first by the great Swiss reformers, Wingly, one of
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.160]   the early and one of the great Swiss reformers at the time of the Protestant Reformation.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.920]   He disagreed completely on this matter with Luther, and it led to great controversy.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.440]   But his view has persisted and is held very commonly by many people at the present time.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:44.880]   It is the view which says that sacraments are just symbols which present the truth in
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:53.320]   a lively manner to the eye, to the naked eye, and therefore are effective in presenting
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.720]   the gospel objectively.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.040]   That is their view of the sacraments.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.480]   In other words, it comes to this, that the sacrament is just another way of preaching,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.480]   and no more.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.920]   It's, if you like, a kind of illustration.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.240]   A man preaches or gives a lecture, and he's trying to bring out a principle, and in order
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.560]   to facilitate it he gives an illustration.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.680]   They say the sacraments are a kind of illustration.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.960]   It's something that you can see, you can see bread, you can see wine, you can break
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:29.760]   the bread, you can pour out the wine, and therefore it is a very good external objective
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:36.240]   representation of the great central message of the Christian faith about the death of
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.920]   our Lord for our salvation.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:46.640]   And therefore every time you do it, you are simply doing it as it were to remind yourselves
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.920]   in this objective manner of the truth of the gospel.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.320]   Well now, of course, as far as it goes, it's perfectly all right, and it's perfectly
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.080]   true.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.640]   And there is nothing more wonderful in the long history of the Church than to notice
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:07.600]   the way in which that has gone on preaching, when the pulpit has been doing all sorts of
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:15.000]   things, and here one sees the wisdom of God and the wisdom of our Lord in appointing this.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.640]   There have been times, I say so often, when the pulpit has been denying the atonement,
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.080]   and then, having done so, they go to the Lord's table.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.960]   They may even say wrong things there, but the bread and the wine are still speaking
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.140]   and are still preaching.
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.480]   It does do that.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.720]   It does do that even in spite of the so-called priest or preacher or minister or however
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.120]   you may designate him.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.920]   But there is then that element, it does that.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:47.240]   Now the Zwinglian point of view, and it has been held very commonly, is that it is that
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:55.960]   and nothing more, simply a kind of objective representation, a pictorial representation
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.520]   of the gospel.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:04.040]   Now then, we come to the extreme opposite, which is, of course, the Roman Catholic view.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.520]   And when I say Roman Catholic, of course, I'm including all who like to call themselves
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.080]   Catholics, the Anglo-Catholics in this country and the Scotto-Catholics in Scotland.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.740]   They all believe exactly the same thing.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.900]   In this matter of the sacrament, there is no difference between the high church people
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.840]   in this country and the Roman Catholics.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.640]   They believe precisely the same thing at this point.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.960]   Indeed, they do at most other points.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.120]   The one big difference between them is that the Anglo-Catholics don't recognize the
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.000]   infallibility of the Pope.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.920]   But they believe everything else that is taught by the Church of Rome, including the Virgin
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.400]   Mary and so on.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.040]   Now, you see, these things are of importance.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.680]   We are told we must all be one.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:51.420]   And as we are fighting materialism and communism, that we must all agree together.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.600]   But you see, it involves your agreeing about things like that.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.240]   That's why I'm calling your attention to them.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.240]   Now then, what is this Catholic view, so-called, of the sacraments?
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.160]   Well, it is that they actually convey grace.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.840]   The Zwingrian view does not say that they convey grace.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.060]   They represent it in a pictorial manner.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:20.520]   But the Roman Catholic view says that the sacrament actually brings the grace to us
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.720]   in a material form, and that they actually convey grace in that way.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.120]   That the grace, as it were, is in the sacrament itself.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.560]   Now, this is their teaching.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.040]   It is what is called the doctrine of transubstantiation.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:43.240]   That, incidentally, only came in in the twelfth century.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.980]   There had been people who had been feeling after it before, but in the early centuries
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:54.440]   of the Church, it wasn't mentioned, it wasn't known, nobody believed it at all.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:00.200]   It's a doctrine that developed gradually and was finally promulgated, as they do, about
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.560]   the twelfth century.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.560]   What is the teaching?
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:08.280]   Well, it is this, that as the result of the consecration, the consecrating act of the
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:18.160]   priest who works a miracle, that the bread actually becomes the body of our Lord, and
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.040]   that the wine becomes, literally, his blood.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.040]   That is their teaching.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.920]   Now, there, but you say to them, "Well, how can you say that, because I look at that
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.440]   bread and I still see bread?"
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:35.080]   "Ah, well, yes," they say, "but you see, you don't understand.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:42.200]   To any substance, like any material, like bread, there are two aspects.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:48.480]   There is what they call the substance, the thing itself, the thing that makes bread bread,
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480]   bread rather than stone.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.480]   That's the substance.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:57.920]   But they say that in addition to this substance, there are what they call accidents.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.920]   What are accidents?
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:05.760]   Well, accidents are the color, whiteness, and friability, and things like that.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:14.720]   Now, what they say is this, that in the miracle which is worked by the priest, the substance
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.040]   of the bread is actually changed.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.400]   It's no longer bread.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   If you analyzed it chemically, it is no longer bread.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.880]   It is literally the body of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:33.120]   The accidents, the whiteness, and so on, still remain, but the substance has been changed.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:40.240]   So, of course, the teaching is that when you take the wafer or the bread, you are literally
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:48.160]   eating with your mouth the body of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.160]   And the priest, when he drinks the wine, for the people, you remember, are not allowed
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.480]   to drink it, it's only the priest who has the wine, when he drinks the wine, he is literally
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:02.520]   drinking the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.360]   That is their teaching.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:11.600]   So you see, inevitably, they have to say that the sacrament conveys the grace.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:19.080]   You are actually eating the body of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the grace that is in him
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.320]   is entering into your physical constitution.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:28.480]   So, they have all sorts of refinements, how you must take the sacrament on a fasting stomach,
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.240]   and so on.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.880]   And not only that, you can see how it is that they worship the sacrament.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.400]   They talk about worshipping the host.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:44.200]   And when they enter into their churches and cathedrals, they bow down before this vessel
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.240]   that contains this bread, and they worship.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.240]   Why?
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.720]   Well, because the Lord is there, his body is there.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:17:02.840]   And so they are worshipping the Lord as he is localized in that bread, in that substance.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:10.400]   And therefore, of course, on this whole argument, you can't go on without the sacrament.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.200]   This is how you do grow in grace, this is how you are sanctified.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.000]   The sacraments are absolutely essential.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.820]   So you must go to Mass.
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.580]   This is the way you are being built up.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.920]   You must go to your priest, you must go to the Mass, and your priest is essential because
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.320]   he alone can work this miracle.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:32.880]   And so you are dependent upon the priesthood for your sanctification, and dependent utterly
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.880]   upon the sacraments.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.720]   Now you see the vital importance of all this.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:46.960]   Here is a great question that arises between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:54.560]   They say that these sacraments are absolutely essential, that by not attending or not taking
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:01.080]   of your sacrament, you are indeed rejecting and refusing the life of Christ, which can
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.360]   enter into you and become part and parcel of you.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.680]   Very well, there is the so-called Catholic view.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.280]   And I'm not going to deal with baptism, but they say then that the grace enters into the
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:17.720]   water in exactly the same way, and it no longer is ordinary water.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:24.880]   It's water with grace infused or injected into it, and therefore there is intrinsic
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.120]   value in the water itself.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:33.720]   Now let me use one technical term, because I think you'll probably hear it more and
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720]   more.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:41.760]   You see, according to the Roman Catholic view, the sacrament acts in and of itself, because
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.480]   the body of the Lord is in it.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.720]   They call it ex opere operato.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.600]   It doesn't matter whether you've got faith or not.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.840]   If you eat that consecrated bread, you're eating the body of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.280]   It doesn't matter who administers it, it doesn't matter who eats it.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.280]   If a man who doesn't believe a thing came in and ate that bread, he is taking of the
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.880]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.960]   That's their teaching.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:11.440]   It acts in and of itself, of necessity, ex opere operato.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:18.320]   Now, what is on the other hand what we may well term the reformed view, the Protestant
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.320]   reformed view?
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:25.480]   No, I say reformed view rather than Protestant, because unfortunately there is a division
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:32.600]   at this point even between Lutherans, the Lutheran Church and the Reformed Church in
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.600]   Protestantism.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.560]   Luther was always in trouble on this subject.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.600]   That's not a criticism.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:44.320]   Martin Luther was a very great man and he did a momentous and tremendous thing.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.520]   You can't expect one man to see everything in a short period of time.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.600]   He saw the great essential vitals, but he was in trouble on this.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:58.720]   He rejected transubstantiation, but he substituted what he called consubstantiation.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.520]   He said the bread is still bread, but the body of the Lord comes into it and joins it
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.240]   so that the bread is in, with and under.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.800]   The body of the Lord is in, with and under the bread.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.440]   Consubstantiation.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.400]   Not a change from bread into, but an addition of the body of the Lord to.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:22.800]   Very well, I leave that at that, but the reformed view is essentially this.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:31.040]   And here I quote, "The sacraments are efficacious means of grace, not merely exhibiting, but
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:38.240]   actually conferring upon those who worthily receive them the benefits which they represent."
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.960]   That is the business of the sacrament.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.120]   How do they do this?
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.200]   Well, that leads me to the fundamental definition of what a sacrament is.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.700]   And here I take, because it seems to me to be one of the best definitions, the definition
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.920]   in the larger catechism of the Westminster Confession.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.480]   You get exactly the same thing in the Heidelberg Catechism and in the various other catechisms
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.880]   of the reformed.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.360]   But here it is in the larger catechism.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:13.840]   A sacrament is a holy ordinance instituted by Christ in his Church to signify, seal,
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:22.280]   and exhibit to those who are within the covenant of grace the benefits of his mediation, to
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:29.560]   increase their faith and all other graces, to oblige them to obedience, to testify and
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.880]   cherish their love and communion with one another, and to distinguish them from those
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:42.480]   that are without, therefore, their outward and visible signs which have at the same time
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.080]   an inward spiritual grace and meaning.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:54.320]   Now there is the traditional reformed definition as to what is meant by a sacrament.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.680]   Very well then, what does the sacrament do?
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:02.600]   Well, the first thing you notice that that definition says is this, that it signifies
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.600]   the grace.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.240]   That is really what Zwingli taught.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.120]   It represents it, it signifies it.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.880]   The breaking of the bread represents and signifies the breaking of the body of our Lord.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:22.800]   The pouring of the wine signifies the shedding of his blood.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.480]   It represents it, it signifies it.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:32.680]   It reminds us of it, it gives us an active, visible, objective representation of it.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.760]   That is what it means by signifies.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.000]   But you notice that the definition went beyond that.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.600]   It not merely signifies, but it seals.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:53.200]   It seals in addition to signifying these things that are represented by the death of our Lord.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.640]   Now what does it mean by sealing?
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:02.080]   Well of course that is a term which we use in many other respects.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:08.160]   It is a way in which, as it were, we guarantee a thing.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:14.240]   If you sell a house or sell something to another person, you not only say that you're doing
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.760]   so there's a document and there is a seal and you sign your name.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.800]   That is the actual giving of the thing, handing it over.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.520]   It is sealing it to you.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:33.920]   And it is very important that we should understand something of this aspect of the matter.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.280]   This is not merely a representation.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.480]   It is not merely a memorial service of our Lord.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.140]   Our Lord said this do in remembrance of me.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:50.800]   But it isn't merely a remembrance, it goes beyond that.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.920]   There is a giving as we receive.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:01.160]   And there is a sealing of the promises to us.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:10.280]   And it is in that way that the sacrament really does convey grace to us, but on one condition.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.480]   And that is that we receive it by faith.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.360]   Now you see the difference between this and the Roman Catholic view.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.000]   Whether you've got faith or not, says the Roman Catholic, if you eat that bread you
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.760]   are literally eating the Lord Jesus Christ with your mouth.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.360]   You are masticating, they use these terms, the Lord.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.360]   He's very bobby.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:38.520]   Now according to this reformed view you're not doing that at all.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.800]   It is essential that you should have faith.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:50.480]   And it is only as you have faith that you are really receiving the grace through the
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.720]   eating of the bread and the drinking of the wine.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:59.480]   Let me use the illustration which I've used before and which seems to me to put the thing
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.820]   so perfectly.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:09.880]   It is the illustration of what happens when a man and a woman become engaged.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:17.160]   Here are two lovers who have told one another that they love one another, and there's
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.160]   no question about it.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.440]   And now they decide to get married.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.760]   And the important moment comes when this man has bought a ring, this engagement ring, and
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:33.120]   he places it upon the finger of his future bride.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.880]   Now that is what is meant by sealing.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.920]   You see there is a sense in which he's telling her no more than he's already told her,
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.320]   and yet she knows that he's telling her something in a way which he's never done
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.320]   before.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:51.600]   That ring is of greater value to her than all his protestations of love.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.660]   It is a visible sign, yes, but it's more than that.
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.360]   He is literally sealing his love to her.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.760]   He's committing himself.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.200]   He's assuring her.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.880]   She's got something tangible upon her finger.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.840]   Now that is the best way to conceal this sealing.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:14.520]   But you notice it involves faith.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.640]   It involves belief.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.800]   For any sort of man, to put a ring upon a woman's finger might mean nothing.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   The man might be a lunatic.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.160]   So it would have no representation.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.160]   It would have no meaning.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.160]   No, no.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.160]   There must be this understanding.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.640]   There must be this relationship.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:40.440]   And it is only then, with this faith in the recipient, that this becomes a true sealing
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.320]   of the promises.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:49.000]   And that is the way in which as Reformed members of the Christian Church, that you and I are
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.920]   meant to understand this.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.240]   In that way, you see, this is not merely a memorial.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.320]   It's not merely a pictorial reenactment.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.000]   It really is giving us.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.800]   This has been God's way.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   God decided that he in this way would speak to us and would give us this assurance.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.400]   Now let me take another analogy.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.480]   You remember what we are told about the rainbow after the flood.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:23.400]   God gave the rainbow, not only as a sign, but as a seal, that he would never drown the
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.120]   world again.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.200]   He not only said that he wouldn't do it.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:33.960]   He said, "Here I give you a sign, a guarantee, the rainbow in the cloud."
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.000]   It's something visible, extra, and it conveys the certainty of the thing.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.440]   It seals the promises to us in a way that the word alone doesn't do.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.520]   The word should be sufficient, but God in his infinite kindness has gone beyond the
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.520]   word.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:53.240]   As I say, an engagement ring is not essential to love, and an engagement ring is not essential
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.240]   to marriage.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.360]   Well, then you may say, "Well, why have a ring at all?"
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.800]   That is exactly what the Quakers and the Salvation Army say about the sacraments.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.200]   They don't believe in the sacraments.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.240]   They say it's unnecessary.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.520]   You're materializing the thing.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.120]   Now there are two answers to that.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.760]   They are deliberately disobeying a command of the Lord.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.160]   It isn't men who decided to have the Lord's Supper.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.240]   It isn't men who decided to baptize.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.200]   It is a commandment of the Lord.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.320]   He has instituted the thing.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.840]   So they're wrong in that way.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:29.280]   But they're also wrong, of course, from the practical standpoint.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.760]   We are not quite as perfect as they would have us believe.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.760]   We need help, and God knows that we need help.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:44.600]   So he has provided these means of grace in order to help us.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.360]   You see, our minds may be weary and tired, and life may be difficult.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.800]   And we may be slackening in our Christian life and perhaps falling into sin, and we
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.560]   come back.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.920]   And the bread and the wine pull us up, as sermons have failed to do, and we are made
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.960]   to think, and that perhaps is the means of our restoration.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.400]   God knows us, and he comes down to our level.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.680]   God in other words is our Father.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:16.380]   And you see, when you're teaching a child, you don't give a lecture, do you?
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:24.080]   When you're teaching a child, you say little, but you have blocks or beads or you draw pictures,
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.200]   and that's the way in which the child can grasp it.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:32.080]   You use these representations in order to convey the truth to him in a tangible, visible
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.080]   manner.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:37.680]   And he grasps it, and he gets something through the beads and through the blocks and so on,
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.680]   which he wouldn't have otherwise.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.680]   That's exactly what the sacrament does.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:47.560]   It's a sign, but it's also a seal.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:55.120]   And because it is a seal in that way, it actually conveys the grace to us.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:03.720]   It conveys to us the results of the great redemption of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:10.360]   Now then, let me apply all this to the question of our sanctification in terms of the Lord's
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.160]   Supper.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.160]   What do we do when we come here?
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:21.520]   Well, first of all, it signifies the Lord's death.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:30.280]   The apostle says there in writing to the Corinthians, "Ye do show the Lord's death till he come."
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.160]   You're declaring it again.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.680]   You're reminding yourself of it.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:39.440]   "Oh, that night when he was betrayed, he took bread and he said, 'This is my body which
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.920]   is broken for you.'
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:47.800]   He took the cup and he said, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood.'"
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.480]   You represent that again.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.000]   You state it again.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.120]   You show the Lord's death till he come.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.180]   And you say, "This is the central thing in the Christian salvation.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.040]   This is the thing whereby I am saved.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.400]   It's because this happened.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.720]   This is a historic event."
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.880]   You put all that emphasis upon it.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.200]   And it's a tremendously important thing to do.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:19.920]   But also, as the apostle reminds us there in that letter to the Corinthians, you remind
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.800]   yourself that it is the way in which this new covenant was actually ratified.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:35.600]   "This cup is the new covenant in my blood."
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:41.120]   Now you go back to the Old Testament and you will find that every agreement, every covenant
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:46.160]   between men was ratified by blood.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.280]   The covenant between God and the nation of Israel was ratified by blood.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:55.040]   In other words, the covenant wasn't signed, sealed, and settled as it were until they
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.760]   had killed an animal and had taken his blood and the blood was put upon the covenant.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.000]   That's the seal, the blood.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.680]   Not sealing wax, but blood.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:15.480]   And the teaching of the New Testament is that the Lord Jesus Christ, when he died upon the
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:23.600]   cross on Calvary's Hill and when his blood was shed, was sealing the new covenant.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.560]   You remember what we had read there in the eighth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:33.920]   just now, how God said that he is putting aside the first covenant, bringing in a second.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.120]   And gives the reasons for that.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.720]   In a sense, it's the one great covenant, but there are two dispensations of it.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.960]   There are two administrations of it.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.160]   And the argument there is that the old administration is done away and the new administration comes
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   in.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:54.360]   And it comes in with the blood of Christ.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.400]   When our Lord died upon the cross, the veil of the temple was rent from the top to the
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.400]   bottom.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:05.280]   That veil which prevented anybody going into the holiest of all.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.480]   Nobody ever went into that holiest of all in the temple except the high priest.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.440]   And he only went in once a year, the veil.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:17.760]   But when Christ died, the veil was rent and the entry into the holiest of all is open.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.120]   That's the new covenant.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:28.520]   And we remind ourselves, therefore, when we come to this table, that our salvation is
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.520]   not something uncertain.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:39.400]   This is something that God planned and purposed before the very foundation of the world.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:44.400]   And he has pledged himself to men, he has covenanted himself, and God's promises can
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.400]   never be broken.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.040]   But in order to help us, he's put the blood upon it.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.800]   And it's the blood of his own Son.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:59.600]   So that you see, this sacrament represents that to us.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:05.000]   We are reminded of God's pledge of himself to us, what he's going to do for us.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.760]   He has covenanted to give us certain things, and here he has sealed it with the blood of
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.760]   his own Son.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.240]   It's the blood of the covenant.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.920]   How important we should remember that.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   Then a third thing it does is this.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:28.680]   The apostle in the tenth chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians, he puts it like
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.680]   this.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:35.280]   He says, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.720]   The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:47.080]   Then for we being many are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   bread."
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.120]   That's an unfortunate translation.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.760]   The apostle didn't say that we are one bread.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:58.160]   What he did say is this, that we are one because the bread is one.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:05.960]   Because the bread is one and it is the body of Christ, we who take it are all one in Christ.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.400]   And it should ever remind us of that.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:13.480]   That was the immediate context in which the apostle dealt with this whole question of
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.800]   the sacrament of the Lord's Supper in writing to the Corinthians.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.440]   They were dividing even there.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:24.340]   Some would come and they'd been eating before they came, and drinking, and perhaps too much,
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.960]   and they were making a disgrace of the communion service.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.600]   Some were wealthy, some were poor, and they were all independent.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.040]   And the apostle says this is denying your unity in Christ.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.760]   We are all members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.400]   The bread is one, so we are one.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.960]   And therefore we should get rid of all divisions.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:49.680]   He died for all his people.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.920]   It tells us that.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:58.920]   But then in addition to signifying these things, it actually seals them and conveys them to
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.000]   us.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   And what is this?
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:11.280]   Well, here are all the benefits of his great redemption, the benefits of the new covenant.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.800]   That's what we do.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:20.520]   When you come and receive this bread and take this wine, what you are really doing is to
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:27.120]   say this, "Yes, this covenant has been made with me."
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.360]   God has said to me, "Take, eat, I'm giving you this."
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:36.480]   Because that lover gives the ring and puts it on the finger of this object of his love,
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.760]   so God says, "I'm giving you this.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:43.080]   I'm telling you this in this way that you may never doubt it again.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.760]   You are the people of my covenant.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:53.000]   And I am giving and extending to you all the benefits of my dear son and all that he did
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:00.440]   when he came into the world and died and rose again, the benefits of the new covenant."
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.520]   What are they?
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:08.680]   Well, we should know all about them.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:13.240]   Forgiveness, you've got that summary of them there in Hebrews 8.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:18.480]   Read it again for yourselves and never come to the communion table without reading it.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:24.120]   Hebrews 8 is the best introduction to the communion service.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.560]   Your sins and iniquities, I will remember no more.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.000]   You're forgiven, absolutely.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.240]   And if you don't leave this table always feeling that you're free, absolutely forgiven,
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.840]   cleansed, that God looks upon you as if you never sinned, you haven't taken it properly.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.920]   God's telling you that in the bread and the wine.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.720]   The body of the Lord was broken for you, his blood was shed for you and for the remission
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.080]   of your sins.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.040]   And because he was God as well as men, it was perfect.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.040]   And your sins have been washed away, they've been removed.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.720]   So that if you don't go out, I say, from this table feeling that you're cleansed
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.800]   and forgiven and renewed, you haven't taken it properly.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.840]   You haven't reminded yourself of the terms of the covenant.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.320]   You haven't read your title deeds.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.760]   You're like a person to whom a fortune has been left, but the person's too lazy
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.800]   even to read the will or forgets what's in it.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.600]   Go back and read your will.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.720]   Make every item certain that it all belongs to you.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.320]   That's what God's saying here.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:33.440]   And he says it there in a way that one cannot say it even in preaching.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:37.000]   But not only that, you remember, he says, "I will be their God and they shall be
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.800]   my people."
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:45.280]   He says, "They will all know me from the least unto the greatest."
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.280]   It won't be confined to certain clever people, just to some philosophic professors.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.040]   No, no, it doesn't matter who this person is.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.880]   In Christ he can get to know me in a way that the greatest intellect cannot know me.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:01.440]   That's what he's telling you.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:06.360]   And then he says that he'll write his laws in our minds and in our hearts, not on tables
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.040]   of stone any longer.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:14.160]   He'll imprint them in our minds and in our hearts so that, you see, you will be living
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.160]   a new life.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.160]   This is sanctification.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.720]   This is holiness.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.400]   You don't simply look at a number of rules and regulations and try to conform to them.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.000]   No, no, there's a principle of holiness within you.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.360]   He's put them in your mind and in your heart and they come from within out.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.680]   You're not always having to force yourself.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.200]   There is something within you forcing you to do it, as it were.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.920]   It is God that worketh in us both the will and to do of his good pleasure.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:45.600]   Well, now, they're the main things, the main items of the new covenant.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:50.120]   And when you come and eat the bread and drink the wine, you are reminding yourself that
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.120]   these are yours.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.960]   I mustn't put it like that.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.440]   God's telling you that they're yours.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.080]   This is God's action rather than ours.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.160]   He is telling us in this way.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.800]   It's the man who puts the ring upon the finger.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.680]   God is doing this to us.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.200]   He is declaring it.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.200]   Very well.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:16.120]   And at the same time, he's giving us life and strength and all we need.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:20.960]   We are reminded that we are in Christ and that his life and power and vigor can become
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.840]   ours, that he is the head of which we are the body.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.280]   The life is in the blood and we are taking the representation of it and we remind ourselves
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   by faith.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.760]   And so you take by faith the life of Christ into you.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:38.240]   You eat his flesh, you drink his blood, not in a material sense but in a spiritual sense,
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:42.520]   as he says himself in John 6, 56 and 57.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.520]   Very well.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.560]   That's what it means.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.560]   Who should take of this?
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:52.640]   Here's a question that has often troubled people.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.640]   Who should take of it?
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.280]   There are people who say, "I can't take of it.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.520]   I haven't lived a good life.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.520]   I've committed a sin since last I was at the communion table.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.920]   I'm not fit, I'm not entitled, I'm not clean enough to come to the table."
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.840]   My dear friend, you're missing the whole point if you say that.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.560]   Who are invited?
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.560]   All believers.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.560]   Who are invited?
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.800]   All who have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.920]   The question I ask you before you come to this table is not, "Have you lived a perfect
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.920]   life?"
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:28.120]   It's not, "Have you lived the last month or the last fortnight without committing sin?"
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.760]   I don't ask you that question.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:37.280]   All I am entitled to ask you is this, "Are you trusting to Jesus Christ and him crucified?
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:42.680]   Do you acknowledge that there is no salvation in you, that you cannot save yourself?
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:47.480]   That you rest your faith on him alone, who died for you at transgressions to a turn?
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.260]   If you do, I say to you, come and welcome.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.960]   It is for people like you.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.720]   It is for the weak as well as for the strong.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.520]   It is for all believers, whatever the condition of their faith.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:04.640]   It is, to use the term of the Fathers, a strengthening ordinance.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.960]   A strengthening ordinance.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.800]   Of course it is, because of what it is, because of what I have been telling you.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.680]   You remind yourself, you say, "Ah, but my sin."
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.840]   I say, "Look at your title deeds, men."
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.240]   You say, "Oh, my poverty."
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.760]   I say, "Look what's been left you in the will."
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.040]   That's what it tells us.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:28.760]   And so it is an invitation to the weak as well as to the strong.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:35.120]   I have sometimes told the story, when down there at the table, of that immortal remark
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:40.520]   of Rabbi Duncan, as they called him, the old professor of Hebrew in the Free Church of
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.820]   Scotland about a hundred years ago.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:48.200]   He was presiding at the communion table once, and he saw a poor woman.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:54.080]   And he could see her weeping and crying, and when the bread came, she was hesitating and
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.600]   didn't want to take it.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:00.160]   And he could see the struggle and the tears and the penitence and the remorse, and he
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.440]   couldn't stand it any longer.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.320]   When he observed her refusal, he cried out to her, "Tacket, woman!
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.320]   Tacket, woman!"
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.600]   He died for sinners.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.840]   In a sense, the fact that she was an unworthy sinner is her best title to taking it.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:16.200]   Now, this isn't to excuse sin.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.880]   This isn't to say, "Sin as much as you like and come to the communion."
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.320]   No man who takes it truly can possibly say that.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.540]   He doesn't discern the Lord's body.
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:24.760]   He doesn't play with it.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.720]   But if you are genuinely in trouble, and if you are conscious of your sin and unworthiness,
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.200]   I say to you, "Take it.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.320]   It will confirm you.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.440]   It will give you a new assurance that he loves you.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:40.360]   You will feel the ring again being pressed upon your finger.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.600]   God will do that to you.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.600]   He will assure you.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.640]   He will bring the covenant to you.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.240]   It is a confirming ordinance.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.480]   And so it is a free invitation to all.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:59.440]   Let not conscience make you linger, or a fitness fondly dream.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.280]   All the fitness he requireth is to see your need of him.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.100]   And if you see that, come, and he'll speak to you.
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:10.080]   And he'll give you his grace as you take the bread and the wine, and it will come to
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.240]   you in a sealing manner.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.240]   It will be conveyed to you in this extraordinary manner.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.300]   You will receive it by faith.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.380]   So we come thoughtfully.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.840]   We come examining ourselves.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.800]   We come acknowledging and confessing our sins.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:30.080]   And above all, we come rejoicing.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.200]   We come with praise and with thanksgiving.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:42.440]   It is a Eucharist because here we realize what has been done for us and what is given
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.960]   to us so freely.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.740]   And as we realize it anew, we praise him.
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.080]   We give ourselves to him.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:57.000]   The man gives the ring and himself, and the woman gives herself to him.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.760]   And that is what happens, or should happen, when we come to the communion table to partake
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.080]   of the Lord's Supper.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:11.760]   You see, there is a sense in which he does nothing more than preaching does.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.960]   And yet he does, doesn't he?
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:21.720]   That ring, oh, what it means and what it says.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.840]   It speaks in a way that words cannot.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.620]   It's saying no more, but it's saying it in a different way.
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.460]   And it gives this extra assurance.
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.880]   So does this.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:39.440]   And so, my friends, when you come to this table, don't come just to think about yourselves
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:43.840]   and to go through a miserable process of self-examination and stop at that.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:51.880]   You start with that, but you end by reading the will, the title deeds, the testament.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.160]   And you listen to God telling you, "I give you all this.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:56.880]   I give my Son for you.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:01.720]   I give you all the benefits of his perfect life of obedience, his sacrificial atoning
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.720]   death.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.400]   I give you all freely.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:09.640]   Take of it and realize what I'm giving you."
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:17.240]   And so you worship him and you praise him and you thank him with the whole of your being.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:22.680]   Is it not obvious, therefore, that in this whole matter of our sanctification, that the
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:30.240]   sacrament of the Lord's Supper occupies a unique place?
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:37.600]   Do this as oft as you eat it and as oft as you drink it.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:42.560]   In remembrance of me, in remembrance of what I have done for you, in remembrance of what
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:45.560]   I have made possible for you.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.160]   That's it.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:55.960]   And thus it promotes our sanctification and brings us more and more into conformity to
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.320]   the image of his dear Son.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:03.240]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
