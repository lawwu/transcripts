[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400]   Well, this morning I want to draw your attention to a portion of Scripture that I think is
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.180]   foundational for all of us, and I hope it will be an encouragement to you.
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.300]   It's in the first chapter of James, James, chapter 1.
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.760]   And I want to just open up for you verses 19 through 25.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.800]   There's a lot here.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.240]   This could easily be a series, but I'm going to sum it all up in one brief message today,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.000]   because I want you to understand the principle and the truth that is here.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.280]   Let me begin by saying this: the distinguishing mark of true salvation, the distinguishing
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:03.580]   mark of true salvation is the desire to hear and obey the Word of God.
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.580]   That is the evidence of regeneration.
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.580]   That is the evidence of new birth.
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.580]   That is the evidence of new life.
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.580]   If you are a genuine Christian, you have a hunger for the Word of God, and I want you
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.260]   to hear that in scriptural terms.
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:32.560]   And let me just remind you of what we read a few moments ago in Psalm 119.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.560]   You don't have to turn to it.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.820]   But here are some of the things we read in that passage, along with many more from that
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.820]   very long chapter.
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:52.340]   "Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the Lord.
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.240]   With all my heart I have sought the Lord, and I have sought the Lord, and I have sought
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.900]   you.
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.020]   Do not let me stray from your commandments."
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:12.060]   Another one: "I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies as much as in all riches."
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.080]   This is what is rising out of the psalmist's heart.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.800]   Contrast that with verse 155 of that Psalm: "Salvation is far from the wicked, for they
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.220]   do not seek your statutes.
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.540]   They seek your good."
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.240]   That is the distinguishing mark, the attitude toward Scripture.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:39.460]   Jeremiah 6:16 says, "Thus says the Lord: 'Stand by the ways, and see and ask for the
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:47.880]   ancient paths, where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.540]   souls.'
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.200]   But they said, 'We will not.'"
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.100]   "We will not walk in it.'"
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.540]   If you walk in the Word, it's evidence of a transformed life through salvation.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.880]   If you do not, it's evidence that you haven't been transformed.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:20.040]   Listen to some other expressions from that 119th Psalm: "I have chosen the way of truth.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.680]   My heart stands in awe of your Word.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.320]   I delight in your law.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.720]   Your law is my delight.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.180]   I will speak of your testimonies also before kings and will not be ashamed.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.300]   I hope in your Word.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.060]   I seek your precepts."
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.740]   And even when the psalmist senses his failures, his desire is still to obey the Word of God.
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.560]   And he says, "Oh, that my ways were directed to keep your statutes."
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:01.120]   "Teach me, O Lord, the way and your statutes.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.220]   Make me go in the path of your commandments.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.440]   Order my steps in your Word.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.340]   Oh, let me not wander from your commandments.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.640]   Incline my heart unto your testimonies.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.440]   Revive me in your ways.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.840]   Cause your Word to be established."
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.440]   "I will walk in the way of your commandments.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   I will be your witness."
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:32.320]   In verse 128, the psalmist said, "I esteem right all your precepts concerning everything.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.840]   I hate every false way."
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.980]   And maybe the sum of that total commitment expressed so beautifully in all those verses
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:52.640]   is verse 112: "I have inclined my heart to perform your statutes forever, even to the
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.320]   end."
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:03.980]   Because, verse 97, "Oh, how I love your law!
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.340]   It is my meditation all the day."
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.440]   That's the testimony of a transformed life.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:20.680]   Godly, true believers are described also in Psalm 1 as those who delight in the law of
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.680]   the Lord.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.200]   And in His law, they meditate.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.360]   They meditate day and night.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.560]   The defining - again, the defining reality of true Christianity is a hunger for the Word
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.360]   of God, a love for the Word of God, a desire to hear the Word of God, to delight in the
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.860]   Word of God, and to obey it.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.560]   And though that is the Old Testament, it's not the only place where this is emphasized.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.080]   In fact, I want to take you to the gospel of John and hear how our Lord says, "I am
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.080]   a believer."
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.700]   And I want to take you to the gospel of John, where the Lord essentially says the same thing
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:04.620]   repeatedly in the gospel of John, that true believers are identified by their commitment
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.440]   to the Word of God, the Scripture.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.320]   Let's start out in John 5, and I'm just going to read you a few select portions out of John's
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   gospel.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.000]   John 5:37 to 40, and these are all coming right out of the lips of our Lord.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.960]   Verse 37 of John 5: "And the Father who sent Me, He has testified me.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.820]   He has testified of Me.
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.200]   You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form."
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.520]   There again is the distinguishing mark between believers and nonbelievers.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.400]   One has heard His voice; the other has not.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.940]   In the next verse, verse 38, our Lord says, "You do not have His word abiding in you,
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.100]   for you do not believe Him whom He sent.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.840]   You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.840]   not the truth.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:00.320]   You do not testify about Me, and you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.200]   You are searching the Scriptures.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.220]   You are not listening to the Scriptures.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:10.980]   You are not applying the Scriptures, and hence you do not have eternal life."
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:20.720]   In the tenth chapter of John's gospel, two verses, verse 26 and 27, our Lord again says,
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.720]   "My sheep."
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.600]   We're talking about My sheep, those that are Mine.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:34.660]   Verse 27: "My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me, and I give them
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.660]   eternal life."
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:43.480]   But verse 26: "You do not believe, because you are not of My sheep."
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:51.600]   The people who are not of Christ's sheep don't believe the Word, even from the lips of the
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.600]   Savior.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.140]   But the people who do believe in Him hear His Word.
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.900]   That is the distinguishing mark.
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:08.240]   Again in chapter 14, verse 21, this is our Lord speaking to the disciples: "He who has
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:15.240]   My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me."
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:22.480]   That is a very clear statement: "He who has My commandments and keeps them is the
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.060]   one who loves Me.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.780]   And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will disclose Myself
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.780]   to him."
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:37.520]   Then in verse 23, "Jesus answered and said to him, 'If anyone loves Me, he will keep
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:44.020]   My word, and My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.020]   him.'"
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:52.360]   Verse 24: "He who does not love Me does not keep My words."
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.940]   "And the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me."
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:01.980]   Again, this is the distinguishing mark of a true believer.
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:09.740]   In the fifteenth chapter and verse 7 in the gospel of John: "If you abide in Me, and My
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:17.840]   words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.240]   For My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.000]   And so prove to be My disciples."
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:35.860]   The distinguishing mark again of a believer, the most notable evidence, is love for Scripture
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.240]   and submission to that Scripture.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:46.160]   So the true Christian lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:52.120]   Back to Psalm 119 and verse 111: "I have inherited your testimonies forever.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.440]   For they are the joy of My heart."
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.960]   It's not a reluctance.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.020]   It's not fear that causes us to obey His Word.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.860]   It's love.
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.400]   It's joy.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.660]   It's blessedness.
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.360]   It's freedom.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:19.600]   Jesus said also, "You shall know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.000]   So we are the people of the Book.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And if you're a part of Grace Church, you understand that, you know that.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.360]   We've been talking about that the last few weeks.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:36.180]   All that God wants to say to His church, He has put inside the pages of the Bible.
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.380]   And so this is where we go for everything.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.340]   We hear His Word.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.880]   We understand His Word.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.020]   We obey His Word.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.040]   We proclaim His Word.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.360]   And we rejoice in that and are blessed.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.880]   And it's how we express our love.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.320]   We love to Him.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.420]   So come back with me to James, chapter 1.
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:06.120]   And James is going to give us a simple, very sort of primer lesson on how to listen to
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.800]   the Scripture.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.600]   You hear a lot of people in recent years talking about listening to the voice of God, trying
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.540]   to hear God.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.680]   I'll make it real simple.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:21.760]   If you want to hear God speak, open your Bible, because that's where you'll hear Him speak.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.660]   You can't sit in a corner and contemplate something forever and never hear the voice
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.180]   of God until you open your Bible.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.420]   So how are we to listen?
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.660]   That's what this is all about.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.820]   Verse 21 has the phrase, "Receive the Word implanted."
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.640]   How are we to receive the Word?
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:50.080]   How are we to receive that Word that implants itself into our hearts and produces fruit?
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.640]   Well, there are four hearts.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.900]   Four essential attitudes, very simple.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:02.740]   Four attitudes: submission, purity, humility, and obedience.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:08.980]   In Luke 8:18, our Lord said, "Beware how you listen.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.000]   Beware how you listen."
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.500]   Don't be like those of whom Isaiah said, "You hear, but you don't understand."
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.520]   And our Lord said the same thing: "You are hearing, but you don't understand."
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:27.680]   You're hearing in a superficial sense, but you're not listening in the sense that you're
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.900]   grasping it and applying it.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.960]   So how are we to listen to Scripture?
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.760]   This is just a very foundational lesson.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.740]   First of all, we are to listen with submission.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.400]   Verse 19: "This you know, my beloved brethren.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.400]   But everyone must be quick."
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:57.220]   "Fast to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.400]   For the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God."
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.860]   Now this is a very interesting little couplet of verses.
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.580]   "It is addressed to my beloved brethren."
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.800]   So He's talking to believers.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.520]   He called them the same thing back in verse 16: "My beloved brethren."
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.280]   So He's talking to believers.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.280]   This is instruction to Christians.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:27.740]   And He says, first of all, in verse 19, "This you know."
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:38.300]   If you're a believer, if you're a part of the beloved brethren, then you already know
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.320]   the power of Scripture.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:46.920]   But He wants to make sure we have no lack of clarity on the fact that it was not only
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.160]   necessary to hear the Scripture to be saved, but it's necessary to keep on hearing.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.160]   "And the word of God is not only necessary to be heard, but it is necessary to keep on
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.160]   hearing it to be sanctified."
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   This is critical instruction.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.780]   This is the most important thing in anyone's Christian life.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:07.920]   This is the basic attitude toward the Word of God that determines your sanctification
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.420]   and your usefulness.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:21.040]   And James is saying, "Look, I don't think I have to prove to you the power of the Word."
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.100]   Because he says in verse 21, "To save your souls."
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:29.380]   But you already know that because you are in the Beloved.
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:34.100]   So he begins in verse 19 with, "This you know."
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:40.060]   I'm going to build on what you already know, and that refers back to verse 18: "You know
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:48.940]   that the Father, who gives every good and perfect gift, has brought us forth - " that
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.920]   is, regenerated us.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.520]   " - by the word of truth."
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:59.220]   And so we are a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.560]   We are new creation.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.100]   We already know that because we know what we were, and we know how the Word of God and
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.020]   the power of the Spirit changed us.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:15.660]   So you have already had a life-transforming connection to the Scripture.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.800]   Faith came by the gift of God when you were hearing the message concerning Jesus Christ.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:28.580]   Or as Peter says in 1 Peter 1:23, "You have been born again, not of seed which is perishable,
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.480]   but imperishable; that is, through the living and enduring Word of God."
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.880]   You literally were born again by the Word of God.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:44.400]   Just as He spoke at creation and created the whole universe, He speaks into the soul of
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.680]   a sinner, and He speaks of life and new creation.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:59.160]   He speaks it into us through faith, believing in the gospel.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:05.480]   So you already understand the power of Scripture.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:11.680]   The law of the Lord said Psalm 19 is perfect, converting the soul.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:18.500]   Paul told Timothy, "It's the Scripture that makes us wise unto salvation."
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.560]   So since you know that, you want to continue.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.400]   You want to continue in it.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.940]   You already know that.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:29.740]   So going forward, there needs to be a continual hearing.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:36.020]   And he says it this way: "Everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.160]   anger."
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.140]   And those are very tightly connected to each other.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:48.280]   God had brought us into spiritual life by His Word.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.440]   Hebrews 4 says, "The Word is alive and powerful."
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:55.800]   Nothing equals its spiritual power.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.000]   You already know that.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.920]   You have already seen the power of the Word.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:11.420]   You have experienced the power of the Word in your life, and you must continue to submit
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.980]   to it.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:19.600]   And that submission is expressed in three statements: quick to hear, slow to speak,
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.320]   slow to anger.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.340]   If we're going to make the commitment the way the Lord wants us to make the commitment
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:32.120]   to hear His Word, it has to be an all-encompassing devotion.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:37.660]   There's a hymn that Charles Wesley wrote, and it has a beautiful way of expressing this:
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:46.900]   "When quiet in my room I sit, your book be my companion still; my joy your sayings to
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.900]   repeat.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.200]   Talk o'er the records of your will.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:59.960]   And search the oracles divine, till every heartfelt word is mine."
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.080]   That's a Psalm 119 attitude.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.960]   "I never have enough.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.620]   I can't get enough.
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:13.700]   I want to search the oracles divine, till every heartfelt word is mine."
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:20.080]   Well, you can do that if you are quick to hear.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:30.400]   It's a general command, and the word "tacus" means just that: fast, speedily, readily.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:36.360]   It's the sort of default position of a believer.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.820]   A believer will tend toward the Word of God.
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.400]   That's the nature.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:49.960]   Just as the psalmist said, Psalm 42, "His heart panted after God."
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.420]   That's what David is expressing in Psalm 119.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:57.240]   So if you're a true believer, you hunger for the Word of God.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.240]   It is your food.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.240]   It is your meat.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.240]   It is your milk.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:06.000]   It is your bread.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.080]   And you have to recognize rightly that even though that is true, it needs to be, if I
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.720]   can say it this way, more true, right?
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.840]   We waste so much of our time filling our brains with things that don't matter.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:27.120]   That bring us absolutely no satisfaction compared to what the true knowledge of the
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.100]   Word of God brings.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:34.900]   This is the distinguishing mark of a true Christian.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.600]   He is quick to hear.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:42.080]   Secondly, slow to speak.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.600]   What does that mean?
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.720]   Well, it means you don't rush into it.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:54.840]   You don't rush into explaining the Scripture.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.320]   That's the context here, the implanted word.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.540]   You're eager to hear it.
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.720]   You can't get enough of it.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.560]   You want all of it you can get.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.280]   But because you understand it is the inspired Word of God and not to be tampered with or
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:19.600]   dealt with lightly, while you are swift to hear, you are slow to speak, because you understand
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.640]   the seriousness of it.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:32.040]   There's honestly too, far too little caution in our world about speaking and teaching,
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.760]   supposedly teaching the Bible.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:43.380]   There's a lack of reluctance where there should be reluctance.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:49.480]   And James reminds us all in chapter 3, verse 1: "Let not many of you become teachers of
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.880]   teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment."
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:05.100]   Don't be in a hurry to say, "Thus saith the Lord," unless you are accurately reflecting
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.220]   His divine revelation.
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:14.920]   And just to remind you, the Bible has to be interpreted correctly.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.360]   The right interpretation is the message from God.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.680]   "So be slow to speak."
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.300]   That's why Paul told Timothy, "Lay hands suddenly on no man."
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:34.700]   Don't be in a hurry to put people in positions of spiritual leadership.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:40.620]   Verse 22 of 1 Timothy 5: "Do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily, and thereby share
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.700]   responsibility for the sins of others."
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.940]   Keep yourself free from sin.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.240]   One of the ways you can literally be responsible for sin is to be a leader.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:59.520]   It is to rush someone into a responsibility to teach the Scripture who is not prepared.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:06.820]   And Paul said to Timothy also in 2 Timothy 2:15, "Be diligent to show yourself approved
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:12.840]   unto God, a workman needing not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:19.120]   If you don't cut it straight, get it right, you bring shame upon yourself.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.500]   And the stricter judgment, as James 3 said.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.360]   There's an old story about Socrates.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.560]   There were always young men wanting to learn from Socrates, and supposedly a young man
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:37.080]   came to him one day and introduced himself, said he wanted to be a part of Socrates' group
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.360]   and learn from him.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.300]   But according to the old story, the moment that he met Socrates, he started talking and
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.120]   he never stopped.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.000]   And finally, Socrates said, "I'm going to teach you."
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.680]   Socrates stopped him and said, "Young man, if I do teach you, I'll have to charge you
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.620]   a double fee."
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.080]   To which the young man supposedly replied, "A double fee?
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.340]   Why is that?"
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:07.920]   And Socrates said, "Because I have to teach you two sciences: how to keep your mouth shut
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:14.280]   and how to use it."
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.880]   Corresponding then to the positive command to receive the Word of God with submissiveness,
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.760]   is this negative command as to the nature of that submission.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:29.880]   The nature of that submission is you understand the seriousness of saying, "I'm telling you,
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.540]   this is the Word of the living God."
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.100]   That's a very serious thing to say.
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.280]   You don't want to put words in God's mouth.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.480]   You don't want to take words out, and you don't want to misinterpret, no less than the
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.760]   great Scottish reformer John Knox.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:55.160]   According to his biographer, when he was called to preach, was profoundly disturbed
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:00.080]   at the thought of speaking for God.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:07.600]   And his biographer writes this about John Knox: "He burst forth in most abundant tears
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.900]   and withdrew himself to his chamber.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:16.420]   His face and behavior from that day until the day he was compelled to present himself
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.640]   in the public place of preaching.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:30.640]   He did sufficiently declare the trouble and grief of his soul."
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.140]   There was reluctance.
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.900]   There was reluctance.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.820]   And James marks the necessity to think like that.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:48.520]   I told you what he said in chapter 3, verse 1, "Teachers are going to get a stricter judgment.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.520]   They're going to be a little more careful.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.520]   They're going to be a little more careful."
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.700]   But he continues to talk about that all through the whole third chapter.
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.200]   Verse 8, "No one can tame the tongue.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:02.020]   It's a restless evil, full of deadly poison."
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:07.880]   To get your tongue under control, you've got to have your brain under control.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.860]   And back in the chapter we're looking at, chapter 1, verse 26, "If anyone thinks himself
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.460]   to be religious and doesn't bridle his tongue, he deceives his own heart.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.280]   This man's religion is worthless."
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.400]   You may think you're religious.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:27.260]   But if you don't know how to bridle your tongue and conform your tongue to the truth, you're
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.780]   deceived and your religion is worthless.
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:36.300]   People love to debate religion, don't they?
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.160]   And everybody thinks they have the answer.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:48.280]   This causes no end of hassle in the church as people quarrel over religion.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.160]   But the truth is, they don't know how to be religious.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.160]   But they don't know how to be religious.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.160]   So they don't know how to be religious.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160]   So they don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.160]   They don't know how to be religious.

[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.160]   They don't know how to be religious.

[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.160]   They don't know how to be religious.

[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.160]   They don't know how to be religious.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:59.160]   Verse 21: "Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness"
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.220]   - okay, so we'll stop at that point.
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:10.940]   If you want to receive the Word, also in verse 21, to receive the implanted Word which is
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:18.160]   able to do its marvelous saving work in your life, you must receive it with purity.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:24.000]   You have to put aside filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, all the overflow
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.180]   of your fallen, corrupt nature.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:36.200]   Peter says also in 1 Peter, chapter 2 - listen to his first verse: "Therefore, putting aside
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:44.600]   all malice" - kakia, evil - "all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander" - all
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.160]   those sinful things - "like newborn babies long for the Lord."
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:53.720]   "For the pure milk of the Word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation."
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.100]   You should be desiring the Word like a baby desires milk.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.880]   It's a one-dimensional life for a baby.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.940]   They want milk and that's it.
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.180]   They don't care what color the curtains are.
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.580]   You might, but they don't.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.140]   All they want is milk.
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.800]   You should have that singular desire.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:15.980]   But in order for that desire to be fulfilled in a way that brings blessing and the righteousness
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.160]   of God, you have to pray.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:25.680]   "And put aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness."
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.300]   It has to be put away.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:32.280]   It's actually a verb that is aorist middle participle.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.220]   It means you have put it off.
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:40.000]   If you're cultivating sin in your life, if you're harboring sin in your life, if you're
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.920]   actively sinning in your life and you're not dealing with it, setting it aside, you are
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.160]   in no position to sin.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.560]   You hear from heaven.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.420]   You will probably not like it.
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.440]   You may decide not even to come around.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.700]   You may be angry.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:05.120]   The point is the only way the Word can produce the righteousness of God is if we put away
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.120]   the wickedness.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:13.920]   And that verb, "putting off" or "putting aside," really literally means to take your
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.160]   cloak off, your coat off.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.740]   To fully yield to the divine influence of the Word of God, there must be a stripping
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:26.740]   off of all filthiness.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.080]   That word "filthiness" is used of dirty clothes.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:35.940]   It's also used of any kind of filth that soils the body, and it became a kind of a word that
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:42.840]   referred generally to moral vice, a very vivid word.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:48.160]   You have to set it aside because you're not going to be able to receive the Word.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:54.940]   If there's sin in the way, get rid of anything that stops your hearing.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:34:02.880]   In fact, the word used, ruparia, comes from a root of rupas, which means "wax in the ear."
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.400]   If you don't get the wax out of your ears, you're not going to be able to hear anything,
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:12.460]   and that wax is filthiness.
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:18.160]   The word is just sort of a general word.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:25.100]   It's a word that covers everything, but even more importantly is the little word "all filthiness."
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:32.320]   If you want maximum impact from the Word, you have to get rid of all filthiness.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:41.300]   All that remains, all that is still there, that prevalent evil attached to your fallenness
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:46.980]   must be confessed and repented of and removed.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.160]   And then the Word of God.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:53.840]   "All filthiness will produce the righteousness of God in you."
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:59.320]   So in the matter of how you listen to the Scripture, you listen submissively and you
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.580]   listen in purity.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.340]   Thirdly, you listen in humility.
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:10.320]   Back to verse 21: "In humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.820]   souls."
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.980]   This is a command.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.160]   You are to have a heart that humbles itself.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.980]   Beautiful word in the Greek.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.420]   It actually means a gentle, meek, willing spirit.
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.380]   You could say teachable, teachable.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:34.640]   A heart that belongs to God is a heart that longs to be taught by God.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:41.640]   "Open my eyes that I may see wondrous things out of your law."
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:46.680]   This is the heart that comes to God and doesn't say, "I've already made up my mind.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.160]   I have my own convictions about all this."
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:56.520]   It's a heart that bows low to the Scripture in a teachable spirit.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:01.220]   It is a spirit that has been conquered.
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.060]   Put it that way.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.060]   It's been conquered.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:16.800]   It means that our pride and our self-will is set aside, and we come to the Word as it
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.160]   is being implanted.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:24.160]   "And I will give you the word of God, and I will give you the word of God, and I will
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.160]   give you the word of God, and I will give you the word of God, and I will give you the
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   word of God, and I will give you the word of God, and I will give you the word of God."
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.

[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.

[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.

[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.

[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.

[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.160]   It's a spirit that's in the heart of God.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:07.840]   Sentimental admiration of the preacher, enjoyment of the mental stimulation, good feelings,
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:15.820]   emotional exhilaration, discovery of truth, all useless deceptions unless they're reflected
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:22.200]   in your life; otherwise, it's just a delusion.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:30.140]   You rather - verse 25 - want to be like the one who looks intently at the perfect God.
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.140]   Perfect law, meaning Scripture.
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:39.440]   A law which, in a sort of an oxymoronic way, a law which is the law of liberty, a law which
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:48.420]   frees you, one who looks intently at the perfect law, the liberating law of the Word of God,
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:45:00.120]   and abides by it, having become not a forgetful hearer, but an effectual doer, this man will
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:05.060]   be blessed in what he does.
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:14.480]   You can sum up your entire Christian life and define it accurately by asking yourself,
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.140]   "What is my relationship to the Word of God?
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:29.220]   Do I take a glance at it occasionally, turn away, forget the real truth about who I am?
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.100]   Or do I look intently at the perfect God?"
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:38.720]   Do I look intently into that law, letting it sink deep into my heart, all of its commands
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.900]   and all of its convictions?
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:52.080]   Do I understand that the deeper I look into that law, the more I am freed from sin, the
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:46:00.080]   more I am freed from the bondage of my transgressions to be blessed?
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.480]   Do I understand that the deeper I look into that law, the more I am freed from sin, the
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.980]   more I am free from the bondage of my transgressions to be blessed?
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.080]   Do I understand that the deeper I look into that law, the more I am freed from sin, the
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.880]   more I am freed from the bondage of my transgressions to be blessed?
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.860]   Do I understand that the deeper I look into that law, the more I am free from sin, the
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.500]   more I am free from the bondage of my transgressions to be blessed?
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.880]   Do I understand that the deeper I look into that law, the more I am freed from sin, the
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.980]   more I am free from sin, the more I am free from the bondage of my transgressions to be
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:26.980]   blessed?
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:30.060]   Do I understand that the deeper I look into that law, the more I am free from sin, the
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:41.180]   So verse 25, "Looking at the law and abiding by it," "staying in it," could translate
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:44.600]   that "remaining in it."
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:50.900]   This is where you're going to find your life blessing.
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:47:02.560]   You can't look at Scripture in some kind of momentary insight.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:08.180]   You have to look intently and keep looking if you want to become an effectual doer who
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:15.160]   is not forgetful and who is blessed.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:20.880]   To close, a portion of Scripture comes to mind in Matthew, chapter 6.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.440]   Matthew 7.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:34.000]   As our Lord was concluding the Sermon on the Mount, He brought it all to a graphic illustration.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:42.460]   Matthew 7, verse 24: "Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:50.860]   them may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock; and the rain fell and
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:56.360]   the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house, and yet it did not fall,
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:59.420]   for it had been founded on the rock."
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:07.320]   "Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:12.860]   man who built his house on the sand; the rain fell, the flood came, the winds blew and slammed
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:17.580]   against the house, and it fell, and great was its fall."
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:20.840]   The final chapter on your life.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:32.040]   Whether you have stood or whether you have fallen is going to be determined by how you
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:36.720]   approach Scripture.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:43.080]   Do you hear His words and do them?
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:46.540]   Here is the path of blessing.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:50.820]   Our Lord, we thank You for such a wonderful morning.
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:55.700]   We thank You for being so rich on so many levels, including the sweet fellowship we
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:59.400]   have with one another, just being together.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:06.220]   We pray that You will cause these truths to sink deeply into our hearts.
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:10.440]   There are people who want to make the Christian life so complex.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:20.800]   It comes down to concentrating on the rich, incomparable treasure of Scripture and staying
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:32.800]   in the Scripture, looking intently at it, and by it being freed from sin and blessed
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.500]   with all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies.
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.320]   We are the people of the book.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:50.780]   We want to be ever more faithful that we may bear fruit and experience spiritual success
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:54.740]   and joy and fruitfulness.
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:57.560]   Thank You for speaking to us in Your Word.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:08.020]   May we, like John Wesley, desire every part of it to be our own.
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:13.840]   We ask this because we find in it our joy, the joy of obedience, and because we desire
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.400]   to glorify You.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.200]   Amen.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   The end of chapter 1 of the book of Revelation.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   Let us pray.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   Let us pray.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   Let us pray.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:48.180]   Thank you.
