[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.900]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.280]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.340]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.140]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.620]   My guest today is Dr. Gary Steinberg.
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   Dr. Gary Steinberg is a medical doctor,
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.820]   PhD professor of neurosurgery, neurosciences,
[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.340]   and neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine.
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.400]   He is a world expert
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.780]   in what is called the cerebrovascular architecture
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.900]   of our brain,
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.620]   which is a scientific term explaining how blood flow
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.260]   to the brain supplies oxygen and critical nutrients
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.060]   to our neurons, our nerve cells,
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.400]   as well as playing a critical role
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.580]   in removing waste products from our brain
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.160]   in order for our brain to function normally.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.180]   During today's discussion,
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.140]   he explains in very clear terms
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.220]   how blood flow to the brain occurs
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.960]   and how disruptions in blood flow,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.340]   in things like stroke and aneurysm,
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.900]   impact brain functioning.
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.500]   We also discuss concussions and TBI,
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.800]   or traumatic brain injuries,
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.500]   which unfortunately are very common
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.780]   and what can be done to treat concussion
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.300]   and traumatic brain injury.
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.740]   Dr. Steinberg also shares with us recent findings
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.700]   from his laboratory and clinic,
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.680]   revealing how stem cells can be used
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.680]   to recover function in the human brain and spinal cord
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.820]   after things like concussion, TBI, stroke,
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.980]   and other disruptions to the cerebrovascular architecture.
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.020]   And he shares with us the science supported tools,
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.540]   that is protocols, that any of us can use
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.420]   to improve the health and functioning of our brains.
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.900]   So if you or somebody that you know
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.300]   has experienced concussion or traumatic brain injury,
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.860]   stroke, or aneurysm,
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.980]   today's discussion is sure to include
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.380]   vital information for you.
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.540]   And for those fortunate enough
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.460]   to not have experienced those conditions,
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.360]   today's discussion will also review
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.260]   the latest science and protocols
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.820]   for improving brain health.
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.620]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.140]   that this podcast is separate
[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.240]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.240]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.080]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.020]   about science and science-related tools
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.380]   to the general public.
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.420]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.120]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.160]   Our first sponsor is 8 Sleep.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.800]   8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.700]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.860]   Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.400]   about the fact that sleep is the critical foundation
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.900]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.860]   Now, one of the key things
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.520]   to getting the best possible night's sleep
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.020]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.960]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.840]   your body temperature actually needs to drop
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.300]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.580]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and alert,
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.760]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.220]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.760]   8 Sleep mattress covers make it extremely easy
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.020]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.580]   and thereby to control your core body temperature
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.380]   so that you fall and stay deeply asleep
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.340]   and wake up feeling your absolute best.
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.160]   I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.580]   for about three years now,
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.180]   and it has completely transformed the quality of my sleep
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.020]   for the better.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.100]   8 Sleep recently launched
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.180]   their newest generation of pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.460]   The Pod 4 cover has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.740]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.980]   and the Pod 4 cover has snoring detection
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.980]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.440]   to improve airflow and stop your snoring.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.460]   This is really important.
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.420]   Snoring is associated with something called sleep apnea,
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.020]   and sleep apnea is known to disrupt brain health
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.280]   and body health in a number of ways.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.180]   Put differently, being able to breathe clearly
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.120]   throughout the night is essential
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.700]   for not only feeling rested when you wake up,
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.920]   but also for brain health and body health.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.840]   If you'd like to try an 8 Sleep mattress cover,
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.900]   you can go to 8sleep.com/huberman
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.340]   to save $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.500]   8 Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.820]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.060]   Again, that's 8sleep.com/huberman.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.100]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.340]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.720]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.660]   Now, I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.700]   of the visual system,
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.300]   and I can tell you that your visual system
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.280]   has to contend with an enormous number
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.240]   of different challenges
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.080]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.240]   Roka understands this,
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.460]   and has developed their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.500]   so that regardless of the conditions you're in,
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.480]   you always see with the utmost clarity.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.900]   Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.820]   for use in sport,
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.340]   in particular things like running and cycling.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.200]   Now, as a consequence,
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.120]   Roka frames are extremely lightweight,
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.440]   so much so that most of the time,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.720]   you don't even remember that they're on your face.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.880]   They're also designed so that they don't slip off
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.120]   if you get sweaty.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.720]   Now, even though they were initially designed
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.960]   for performance in sport,
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.160]   they now have many different frames and styles,
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.240]   all of which can be used in sport,
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.240]   but also when out to dinner, at work,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.480]   essentially any time and in any setting.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.920]   If you'd like to try Roka glasses,
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.240]   you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.040]   and enter the code Huberman to get 20% off.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.280]   Again, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.100]   and enter the code Huberman to get 20% off.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.200]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Aeropress.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.800]   Aeropress is like a French press,
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.180]   but a French press that always brews
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.480]   the perfect cup of coffee,
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.880]   meaning no bitterness and excellent taste.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.000]   Aeropress achieves this
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.160]   because it uses a very short contact time
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.880]   between the hot water and the coffee.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.540]   And that short contact time also means
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.120]   that you can brew an excellent cup of coffee very quickly.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.160]   The whole thing takes only about three minutes.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.640]   I started using an Aeropress over 10 years ago,
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.920]   and I learned about it from a guy named Alan Adler,
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.720]   who's a former Stanford engineer, who's also an inventor.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.680]   He developed things like the Arobi Frisbee.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.000]   In any event, I'm a big fan of Adler inventions,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.920]   and when I heard he developed a coffee maker, the Aeropress,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.120]   I tried it, and I found that indeed,
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.420]   it makes the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.640]   It's also extremely small and portable,
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.320]   so I started using it in the laboratory
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.480]   when I travel on the road, and also at home.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.440]   And I'm not alone in my love of the Aeropress coffee maker.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.080]   With over 55,000 five-star reviews,
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.080]   Aeropress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.360]   If you'd like to try Aeropress,
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.000]   you can go to aeropress.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.520]   Aeropress currently ships in the USA, Canada,
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.680]   and to over 60 other countries around the world.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.000]   Again, that's aeropress.com/huberman.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.820]   I usually mention this at the end of episodes,
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.760]   but if you're learning from
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.980]   and/or enjoying the "Huberman Lab" podcast,

[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.420]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Gary Steinberg.
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.760]   Dr. Gary Steinberg, welcome.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.160]   - Thank you, Andrew, pleasure to be here.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.400]   - I have a lot of questions.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.320]   I know people are interested in keeping their brains healthy
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.960]   and sadly, things happen to the brain,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.160]   sometimes as a consequence of aging,
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.000]   sometimes as a consequence of certain activities.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.280]   Maybe you could just explain for us right off the bat,
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.560]   what is a stroke?
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.280]   What is an aneurysm?
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.640]   What is a hemorrhage?
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.000]   Where do these terms overlap?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.160]   How are they different?
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.920]   Obviously, none of us want these things.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.060]   And we will talk about ways to prevent them
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.740]   and your ways of treating them as well, of course.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.820]   But just to start off,
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.000]   maybe we can just lay down the nomenclature.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.480]   - Sure, so a stroke is like a heart attack of the brain.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.400]   It involves disruption of blood flow to the brain,
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.360]   either in the form of a blocked vessel
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.240]   or less likely a hemorrhage.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   About 87% of strokes are due to a clot,
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.280]   either forming in the brain artery itself
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.920]   or forming closer to the heart,
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.680]   in the heart or in the carotid artery
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.440]   and dislodging and blocking blood flow to the brain.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.320]   About 13% are caused by a hemorrhage,
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.480]   bursting of a blood vessel.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.560]   And that results in lack of oxygen and glucose
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.000]   being delivered to the brain cells.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.200]   And that ultimately causes death of tissue
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.720]   and disruption of bodily functions, neurologic function.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.660]   That's what a stroke is.
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.600]   - How do we know if we have clots residing in our body
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.200]   that could be dislodged?
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.780]   I know that some people when they fly wear compression socks.
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.640]   I know that some people have genetic mutations
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.080]   that affect clotting.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.160]   I'll raise my hand here and I'll do a disclosure.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.840]   I did some genetic testing.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.800]   I'm a heterozygote for factor V Leiden,
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.280]   which is a clotting factor.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.360]   Heterozygote folks means I have one mutant copy.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.560]   So fortunately I don't suffer from excessive bleeding
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.460]   or clotting, but there are lifestyle factors
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.840]   that can exacerbate an existing mutation like that.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.080]   People who are homozygous mutants for factor V Leiden,
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.200]   of course, at much greater risk for clotting and bleeding.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.040]   So I just disclosed a lot.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.560]   Maybe you could comment on some of the clotting factors
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.880]   and lifestyle factors that impact clotting,
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.480]   but how would somebody know if they've got a clot
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.840]   that could potentially go to their brain?
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.520]   - Sure, well, you might not know.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.840]   In many cases you don't know, and that's the problem.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.120]   You can have a predisposition, as you say,
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.120]   due to certain genes that are mutated or represented
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.160]   that predispose to clots.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.240]   And those clots can occur on the arterial side
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.200]   or the venous side.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.640]   The arterial side is what generally causes a stroke,
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.360]   an ischemic stroke.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.000]   On the venous side, you can sometimes have problems.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.480]   When you talk about flying, not moving your legs,
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.440]   developing clots in your legs, wearing compression boots,
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.560]   that's on the venous side, and that can cause something
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.000]   like a deep vein thrombosis, which is not good
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.040]   'cause it can travel to the lung
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.200]   and cause a pulmonary embolus.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.680]   That generally on the venous side does not go to the brain.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.160]   - Oh, good, in my case, that feels fortunate, yeah.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.280]   - Exactly, you can develop some venous problems
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.040]   in the brain, which can cause a venous-type stroke.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.360]   That's much less common, and the way that causes a stroke
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.000]   is not lack of blood flow being delivered to the brain,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.960]   but by having a clot in an important vein,
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.000]   the blood can't get out of the brain.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.760]   It backs up and causes swelling or edema,
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.560]   but that's much less common.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.360]   Generally, we talk about strokes as being arterial
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.360]   in nature and either blockage of a blood vessel
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.240]   or bursting of a vessel.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.680]   - What are some things that impact clotting
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.560]   and/or excessive bleeding?
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.520]   My understanding is these factor V Leiden mutations
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.080]   are one example.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.720]   The other is, let's say somebody takes,
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.060]   say, a blood-thinning agent like baby aspirin,
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.400]   or I'm told, and I'll have to check this,
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.040]   I'm sure people will say in the YouTube comments,
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.940]   that if you take lots and lots of, say, fish oil
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.120]   or things like that, you can become more of a bleeder.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.720]   Some people out there are hemophiliacs,
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.380]   and then my understanding is also that certain forms
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.960]   of oral contraception for women
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.160]   can increase the rates of bleeding.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.640]   So tell me if I'm wrong about any of those
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.700]   and if any of those things predispose people
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.600]   to more stroke or hemorrhage.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.600]   - Sure, so different kinds of drugs thin the blood,
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:22.280]   and they can predispose you to having a larger hemorrhage
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.600]   than you would if something bursts,
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.600]   or if you fall and have some traumatic injury to your brain
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.800]   or anywhere in the body.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.960]   In general, they don't cause a hemorrhage
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.520]   because they're fairly safe,
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.520]   but if there's, as I say, some interruption to the body,
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:50.840]   like a bruise, it would be a much worse type of bleed.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.040]   So aspirin is a type of antiplatelet agent
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.040]   that thins the blood.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.060]   There are many types of antiplatelet agents,
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.940]   and they're very, very useful for treating people
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.660]   who have a predisposition to develop clots
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.340]   'cause they thin the blood.
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.520]   Anticoagulants are another type.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.820]   They're known as Coumadin, Warfarin, Eliquis.
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.380]   There's lots of new agents,
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.440]   and they're often taken orally
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.740]   or can be given intravenously.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.580]   Heparin's another one.
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.980]   Again, they thin the blood,
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.580]   so they would put someone
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.180]   at somewhat increased risk for hemorrhage.
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:37.100]   Then, as far as oral contraceptives,
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.500]   if you go back to the 1970s
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.100]   when the oral contraceptives first generation
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.860]   were coming out, it turns out,
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.580]   and they were heavily estrogen-dominated
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.020]   rather than progesterone.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.540]   They did, and they still, to some extent,
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.100]   increased the risk of developing clots.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.620]   So women back in the '70s
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.380]   who took oral contraceptives and smoked
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.180]   had a very, very high incidence
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.900]   of developing clots and ischemic strokes
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.060]   and clots elsewhere in the body.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.800]   The newer generations are much safer
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.740]   in terms of developing clots,
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.260]   but for my patients,
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.860]   many of whom have had strokes
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.300]   or are at risk for stroke,
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.180]   we recommend that the women
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.140]   do not take oral contraceptives,
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.780]   that they use some other form.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.800]   IUD, for instance, may have a little bit
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.580]   of progesterone, which is released locally,
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.340]   but it doesn't cause a large increase
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.300]   in estrogens or progesterone systemically.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.000]   So we still believe that the oral contraceptives
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.400]   increased the risk somewhat,
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.480]   not the way it did for first generation.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.920]   And then there are other modifiable factors
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.880]   besides the genetic ones.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.960]   So smoking is a very high risk factor
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.920]   for developing clots,
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.760]   which can lead to strokes, heart attacks,
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.500]   peripheral vascular disease.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.160]   High lipids is another.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.160]   So when people have high, bad cholesterol, LDL,
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.160]   it's recommended that if they can't reduce it with diet,
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.240]   that they take a statin.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.720]   The statins are very, very effective
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.400]   in lowering the bad cholesterol,
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.080]   preventing strokes and heart attack.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.160]   Interestingly, the statins have also been shown
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.140]   to be highly beneficial for the blood vessel integrity,
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.520]   even if you don't have high LDL.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.340]   - Interesting.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.560]   - So they have other beneficial properties.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.480]   So again, for my patients,
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.520]   I often recommend they take a statin,
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.480]   even if they don't have high cholesterol.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.320]   - Interesting.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.600]   - And then hypertension is another risk factor
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.040]   for developing clots and arterial disease.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.040]   - When you say that smoking dramatically increases
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.520]   the risk of stroke, is that because of nicotine per se?
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.080]   Is it the vasoconstriction and blood pressure elevation
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.440]   that comes from nicotine itself?
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.520]   Or is there something about smoking,
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.840]   maybe even vaping, I don't know,
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.360]   that the contaminants, the other chemicals,
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.640]   in cigarettes or vape chemicals,
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.840]   that increases the stroke risk?
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.320]   Or is it nicotine itself?
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.640]   - It's not just nicotine.
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.260]   Nicotine is one of the factors,
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.960]   but it's the other products that are produced by smoking
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.560]   that can have an effect.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.340]   - So given that so many fewer, at least Americans,
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.800]   and I think worldwide, people are smoking less,
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.240]   are we seeing less stroke?
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.300]   - Yes, the incidence of stroke is actually decreasing.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.560]   It may be in part due to decreased smoking,
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.880]   but it also is in part due to other modifiable factors.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.200]   So hypertension is much better treated now
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.560]   than it used to be.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.320]   People take better care of themselves
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.040]   in terms of other lifestyle factors.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.480]   So people exercise more.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.480]   There's a lower incidence in some subgroups of obesity.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.400]   Those are the risk factors also for developing strokes
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.140]   and as well as heart attack.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.680]   - What is the relationship between heart health
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.880]   and brain health as it relates to stroke?
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.600]   I would imagine that anything that's good for our heart
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.840]   is probably good for our brain,
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.720]   given the enormous amounts of blood and glucose
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.840]   that the brain requires to function normally.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.800]   - Yeah, it's a good point.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.120]   In general, the things that are good for the heart
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.280]   are good for the brain.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.480]   There are differences between the heart and the brain,
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.480]   but they both depend very much on blood flow.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.560]   The brain's unique, though,
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   because the brain represents only 2% of the body weight,
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.720]   yet it draws 15% of the total blood flow
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.720]   and remarkably, it consumes 20% of the body's oxygen.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.040]   - Amazing. - So the brain,
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.160]   I still think the brain is the most important organ,
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.920]   not the heart, not the kidneys, but I'm biased, of course.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.920]   - Yeah, you've spent some time
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.840]   in the landscape of the brain.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:26.640]   Yeah, it's clear that of all the tissues in the body,
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.640]   if you had to pick one tissue to remove one cubic millimeter
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.420]   of that tissue, that your brain,
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.460]   and probably the neural retina
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:38.060]   would be your least favorite choice,
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.040]   just given the deficits that can result.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.700]   - Right, and of course, the brain also is what makes us human.
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.980]   - Right, speaking of which,
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.740]   if we take a little departure into neurosurgery itself,
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:53.740]   your specialty, of all the years of doing brain surgery,
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:18:01.700]   can you recall maybe one of the most incredible moments
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.380]   or days that allowed for some insight
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.800]   into how the brain works by virtue of, let's say,
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.460]   stimulating a given brain area
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.140]   or removing a given brain area or something of that sort?
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.980]   I ask this because so very few of us
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.300]   will ever have the opportunity to do what you do,
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.380]   and if I were here talking to an astronaut,
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.820]   and by the way, I consider neurosurgeons
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.660]   the astronauts of neuroscience,
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.260]   if I were sitting here with an astronaut,
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.060]   I'd say, "Tell me something interesting
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.420]   "about being in space that I wouldn't know
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.180]   "from looking at pictures or videos of it."
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:36.340]   What is an example of maybe one of the more profound
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.380]   insight-stimulating moments from doing brain surgery?
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.340]   - I mean, every patient is different,
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.940]   so I'm always learning, and that's why I still enjoy it.
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.260]   That it's a challenge, and you have to think quickly.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.580]   It's not simply mechanical,
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.860]   but for instance, a couple weeks ago,
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.820]   I had a patient who had a vascular malformation,
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.820]   which was located, we thought, right in her speech area.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.860]   So in order to operate safely,
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.600]   first we did what's called a functional MR scan
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.780]   before surgery, and that gives us some idea
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.340]   of where the speech area is.
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.260]   We can map it out on an MR scan,
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.340]   and the way it's mapped out is
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:27.640]   we have the patient awake talk to us
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.860]   when they do the scan, and because there's a coupling
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.800]   between blood flow and the neuronal activity,
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.860]   when the speech area, the language area,
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.800]   is stimulated by talking,
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.700]   there's increased blood flow to that area,
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.540]   and we can see that on an MR scan.
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.660]   That's how the MR scan works.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.300]   So we had some idea that this was very close,
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.480]   if not in the speech area,
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.700]   but the most accurate way of determining that
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:01.540]   is to operate on the patient with her awake.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.760]   So we took, what we did was we sedate the patient.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.300]   We don't put a tube down and induce general anesthesia.
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.260]   We numb up the scalp.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.780]   We take off a piece of bone after cutting the scalp,
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.220]   open the membrane covering the brain called the dura,
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.780]   and then we allow the patient to wake up more
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:20.980]   from the sedation,
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:25.260]   and then what I did on this particular patient
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:30.260]   was to use a tiny stimulator, a little probe,
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:35.740]   and I can stimulate areas of her cortex with her awake
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.220]   and see if the stimulation impairs her ability
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.400]   to speak or understand language,
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:47.240]   and quite surprisingly, there was no activity
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.540]   in the corridor that I chose.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.680]   Sometimes when we see an area
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.700]   that is involved with speech that's eloquent,
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.900]   we have to choose a different pathway
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.860]   to get to the underlying vascular problem,
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.340]   and so that's what we did in this case,
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.060]   and she talked to us the entire case.
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.900]   She told us about her daughter
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:14.660]   who was very involved in debate
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.320]   and all of her successes while we were operating,
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.660]   while I was taking out this vascular malformation
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.740]   under 20 magnification with very special instruments.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.980]   I use a laser now which has a diameter
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.780]   of the fiber optic cable.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.940]   The laser tip is 0.5 millimeters,
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.540]   so that I think is the gentlest way.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:42.180]   Other times I've been surprised about brain function
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.980]   is operating deep in the brain
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.260]   is a part of the brain called the brainstem,
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.620]   which you know well.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.920]   It's a small area that connects the thalamus.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.900]   Those are the signals coming from the cortex,
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.740]   go through the thalamus to get down
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.060]   to the face, arm, and leg to move the muscles,
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.060]   and all the sensory information,
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.580]   which comes from the arms and legs and face,
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.220]   goes through the brainstem up to the thalamus
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.600]   and then to the cortex.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.980]   In this area, although it's very small,
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.180]   are contained very closely packed fiber tracts
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.340]   and nuclei.
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.540]   Those are the cell bodies, very important neurons.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.940]   And when I trained back in the '80s,
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.060]   we never operated in that area
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.160]   because we couldn't do it safely.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.740]   With developments in computer technology
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.300]   and imaging and anesthesia,
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:41.300]   we can now find safe corridors to get into the brainstem,
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.740]   and sometimes we stimulate for other pathways,
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.940]   not language, but other pathways.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.300]   And I'm continually amazed.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:54.300]   This last week, I took out two vascular malformations,
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.220]   and they're not big.
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.660]   I mean, they measure between eight millimeters
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.980]   and a centimeter,
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.140]   but they can wreak havoc in the brainstem
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.300]   because it's such high-priced real estate,
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.800]   and these had bled.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.300]   But I found a safe corridor to go through.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.620]   I took it out, and I'm amazed
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.380]   that you hardly set the patients back in some cases
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.300]   because in the past, we would have clobbered the patients
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.380]   doing that.
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.220]   - Amazing.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.180]   Yeah, it's remarkable to me how much can be done now
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.180]   with imaging, so visualizing the brain
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.580]   and being able to target a specific location.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.780]   And you mentioned fiber optic cables.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.020]   I've also heard of things like the gamma knife and lasers.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.660]   So how much of neurosurgery nowadays
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.200]   is actually burrowing down through the brain
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.800]   to a given location to stimulate or remove tissue
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.780]   versus using these laser or fiber optic approaches
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.780]   to sort of triangulate and get to something
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.440]   without having to basically drill down through the brain?
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.280]   - Right.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:54.140]   Neurosurgery is becoming much less invasive.
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.460]   And this is something that I really tried to push
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.460]   when I was a chair of the department
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.120]   for 25 years at Stanford.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.100]   So minimally invasive techniques include
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.560]   operating through the vessels, right?
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.660]   So now, I don't do this myself, but my colleagues,
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.900]   some of whom are neurosurgeons,
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.100]   some are interventional radiologists,
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.620]   they can go through the groin in the femoral artery
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.980]   or through the radial artery.
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.700]   They can thread a catheter backwards into the brain.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.300]   From the groin, they can go up into the aorta,
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.700]   then up into the carotid artery.
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.620]   From there, they can go up into the brain arteries,
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.380]   the middle cerebral artery,
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:39.420]   and they can treat some of the hemorrhagic problems
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:43.700]   like aneurysms by deploying thrombogenic coils there
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.740]   or new devices.
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.220]   They can pull clots out if there's an acute stroke
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.900]   from a clot in an artery in the brain.
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.300]   It's really quite impressive.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:59.140]   Then we and others have developed techniques
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:03.740]   to use focus radiation on the brain,
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.860]   and that's called radiosurgery.
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.300]   So examples of that are Gamma Knife,
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.380]   Cyber Knife was invented at Stanford
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.540]   by one of my colleagues, actually,
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:17.180]   and this uses beams of radiation.
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.340]   Gamma Knife uses a cobalt source,
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.980]   multiple sources of cobalt.
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.780]   The Cyber Knife uses X-rays.
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.580]   When I started, I was very involved
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.100]   with using cyclotron-generated heavy particles
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.220]   like helium and proton, and they can be focused.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.420]   And the advantage of this is you don't have
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.300]   to open the skull.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.140]   You focus it on a very small area,
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.020]   and you can eliminate vascular malformations
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.460]   called arteriovenous malformations, tumors.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.780]   You can even use it for some pain conditions
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.500]   like trigeminal neuralgia.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.900]   It's not risk-free because even though radiation
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.700]   doesn't require opening the skull,
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.100]   it still is a form of energy that's damaging.
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:05.980]   That's how it works.
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.500]   It causes, for the AVMs,
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.260]   it gradually clots off the blood vessels,
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.100]   but it's much easier and much safer
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.980]   than some of the invasive techniques that we use.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.140]   We operate now through tiny openings,
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.620]   even when we do open surgery.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.980]   When I trained, we used to shave the whole head.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.100]   We would open a huge area of the skull.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.500]   Now we operate through tiny, very small areas.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.420]   When I take out vascular malformations
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.020]   in the brainstem, for instance,
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.060]   I sometimes operate through openings
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.740]   in the side of the brainstem that are two to three millimeters.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.580]   - Wow.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:47.940]   - Another form of noninvasive treatment
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.140]   that neurosurgeons use is called focused ultrasound.
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.740]   Again, you don't have to open the skull.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:59.620]   It focuses sound waves on areas of the brain.
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:03.460]   We're using that to treat essential tremor.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:08.540]   Or Parkinson's disease,
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.780]   it's starting to be used for treating tumors.
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.620]   So these are all advances that were not present
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.100]   when I trained.
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.060]   Another way of treating minimally invasive,
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.900]   although it still requires a hole in the head,
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:26.900]   is to put in an electrode and stimulate the brain.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:31.860]   So that was first used for treating Parkinson's disease,
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.740]   very effective for medically intractable Parkinson's.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.700]   It's used to treat chronic pain.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:43.140]   Recently, it was shown to be beneficial for epilepsy.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.420]   In fact, the two major trials,
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.140]   prospective randomized trials that were done,
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.900]   were led by physicians, neurologists at Stanford,
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.820]   and showed the benefit of stimulation of the brain
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:00.020]   to treat a very difficult epilepsy.
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.220]   So this, I think, is going to be the future,
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.060]   is more and more minimally invasive.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.160]   In fact, we're using some of these techniques
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.060]   to even treat psychiatric disorders,
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.820]   like depression, obsessive compulsive behavior.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.820]   - Incredible.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.140]   I should have asked this earlier,
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.140]   but TIAs, transient ischemic attacks.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.220]   I think most people assume or know
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.980]   that the symptoms of stroke include sudden weakness,
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.740]   maybe hemiparalysis of the face,
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.860]   confusion, slurring of the words.
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.660]   Of course, these symptoms can be the consequence
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.940]   of other things as well.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.260]   What are some of the symptoms of transient ischemic attacks?
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.620]   And is there anything that people can take
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.660]   for transient ischemic attacks?
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.500]   And I, of course, would love for you to inform us
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.300]   what a transient ischemic attack is.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.380]   - Right, so a transient ischemic attack, or TIA,
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.540]   is a reversible stroke.
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:57.420]   It results in a temporary loss of function,
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.940]   such as inability to move,
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.180]   partial paralysis or complete paralysis,
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.480]   but then it resolves.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.060]   Inability to speak, visual problems,
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.360]   double vision, blurred vision, loss of vision.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.860]   It can cause slurred speech
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.940]   or difficulty understanding language,
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.580]   imbalanced problems, walking, even cognitive problems.
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.380]   So it can vary depending on what part of the brain
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.060]   it affects.
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:30.580]   In the past, it was defined as a neurologic deficit
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.580]   due to lack of blood flow that lasted less than 24 hours.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:38.300]   But now that we have such sophisticated imaging,
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.220]   like MR scan, some of these patients who have a TIA,
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.220]   what would have been considered a TIA before,
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.700]   lasting minutes or up to 24 hours,
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.140]   on MR scan have been shown to have a little stroke.
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.900]   So now the definition is a little different.
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:58.780]   If you do an MR scan and it shows a new abnormality,
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.740]   a new stroke, then it's called a stroke rather than a TIA.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.460]   So there's a little overlap there,
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.940]   but it's a temporary loss of neurologic function
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.940]   due to lack of blood flow, or in some cases, a hemorrhage.
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.260]   - My understanding is that people can also have strokes
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.880]   in their spinal cord, because spinal cord tissue
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.940]   is, after all, central nervous system tissue.
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.120]   I think most people don't realize this,
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.740]   but the tail end of the brain, the brainstem,
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.140]   as we were talking about before,
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.580]   essentially extends down the spinal column.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.100]   It's more like a long tail, right?
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.900]   Down to the base of the pelvis, really.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.180]   So we call it the spinal cord, but it's all brain.
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.740]   It's contiguous with the brain.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:50.540]   So how often do you observe spinal strokes
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.860]   and what are some of the symptoms of spinal stroke?
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.180]   - Yeah, it's much less common
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.580]   than a stroke involving the brain,
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.380]   probably because there's less tissue involved.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:07.380]   The spinal cord is supplied by an anterior spinal artery.
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:11.500]   That's an artery on this side, and by two-
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.660]   - So for those listening, sorry,
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.960]   it would be on the stomach side of the body, yeah.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.100]   - And it's supplied by two arteries,
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.000]   posterior spinal on the backside.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.260]   So if there's an interruption to blood flow
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.020]   in any of those arteries,
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.860]   it can cause death of tissue in the spinal cord,
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.740]   and that would result in a neurologic deficit,
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.020]   depending on where it is.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.720]   So if it occurred on the stomach side,
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.820]   that whole artery which supplies
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:47.820]   the two-thirds of the spinal cord on the stomach side,
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.460]   and it involved both sides of the spinal cord,
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.300]   it would cause paralysis of both legs,
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.220]   and a partial sensory deficit
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.820]   would cause loss of pain and temperature,
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.380]   'cause that's where those pathways are.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.820]   If the problem was on the backside of the cord,
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.580]   it would cause a problem potentially
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:15.540]   with a light touch sensation in the legs.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:20.540]   If it was below the cervical region,
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.700]   and problems with what's called proprioception,
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.300]   that's the ability to recognize
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.240]   where your position of your joints is.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.340]   So it depends on where it is.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.860]   Some of the vascular problems I deal with
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.700]   actually do involve the spinal cord,
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.440]   and you can develop other problems there.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.580]   For instance, you can have a direct connection
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:47.580]   between a abnormal artery and a vein in the spinal cord,
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:50.340]   which doesn't cause a typical stroke
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.600]   by blocking blood flow,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.980]   but it causes more of that venous problem we discussed,
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.500]   where there's so much blood going directly
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:01.520]   from the artery to the vein, bypassing the capillaries,
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.880]   that the veins become engorged.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.540]   The blood can't get out of the spinal cord,
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.840]   and the spinal cord becomes congested,
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.560]   and patients can present with problems,
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.760]   walking or sensory problems.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.240]   If the spinal cord is involved
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.440]   in the cervical region up high,
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.560]   then the arms can be involved as well.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.400]   - I see.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.520]   I should have asked this earlier,
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.000]   but is there any relationship between alcohol intake
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.680]   and the propensity for stroke or hemorrhage
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.520]   or any of these other things?
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.580]   - Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.780]   Yes, there is.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.360]   People who indulge or overindulge
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.560]   are at risk for developing stroke problems.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.160]   So it's another contributory factor,
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.060]   which can promote problems with the blood vessels,
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:56.160]   clots, but also hemorrhage.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.440]   So it can make the blood vessels more fragile.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.300]   Another factor I see commonly
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.960]   in patients who develop aneurysms,
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.920]   those are blisters on the blood vessels in the brain,
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.360]   and they're like little balloons,
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.440]   and as they enlarge,
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.640]   they rupture just like a balloon can burst.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:17.400]   Some of the patients I see are not just smokers,
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.880]   but indulge in other drugs.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.740]   So cocaine, methamphetamines,
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:27.200]   markedly increase the risk of developing these aneurysms
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.240]   or developing hemorrhage, bursting of a blood vessel.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.520]   - And is that because those drugs
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.080]   tend to increase blood pressure during their use?
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.540]   - It's because they damage the vessels,
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.360]   and they also cause hypertension.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.840]   Yes, it's both factors.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.120]   So when I operate on these patients
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.580]   and looking at the vessels,
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:52.180]   they are ragged, they're very thin.
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.780]   They're not normal vessels.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.000]   They lack structural integrity.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.940]   So it contributes to the development
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.520]   of poor vessel integrity.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.200]   And drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.040]   can jack the blood pressure up,
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.760]   and that could cause a hemorrhage
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.360]   in these problematic vessels, yes.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.760]   - So it sounds like the message is clear.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.200]   Avoid cocaine use, avoid methamphetamine use,
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.200]   and avoid excessive alcohol intake,
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.680]   if you want to avoid stroke.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.880]   - Right, and throw smoking in there too.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.560]   - It's interesting because for a lot of years,
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.860]   there was so much discussion about red wine
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.360]   being good for heart health.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.700]   Now it's debated.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.540]   The moment I say that,
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.580]   people will send a bunch of studies that say yes.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.880]   My stance on the more recent data
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.900]   is that if you had to pick,
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:40.120]   you drink less or not drink as opposed to drink.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.480]   But I'm curious what your take is on this.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.880]   - Well, you know, this is interesting,
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.440]   and I'm always quite amazed
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.920]   at the way people change their behavior
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.840]   based on one study that comes out,
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.920]   even if it's a good study.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.240]   So yes, it used to be
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.320]   considered beneficial if you drank red wine.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.880]   And then for a while,
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.520]   studies showed any wine was beneficial in moderation.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:10.360]   And that used to be two drinks a day for men,
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.920]   one drink a day for women.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.240]   And in the latest studies,
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.600]   which have been surfacing this year,
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.840]   suggest no alcohol is good.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.440]   But next year, it may be that we're back to,
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:26.000]   oh, wine is the best thing you can do in moderation
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.680]   for your brain and heart health.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.680]   - Yeah, it's tricky.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.800]   My read of the data,
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.180]   and here I mean the data across multiple,
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.400]   certainly not every study,
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.240]   but multiple studies,
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.880]   is that zero to two drinks per week
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.680]   seems to be the range that everyone agrees is safe,
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.460]   at least for non-alcoholic adults.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.640]   And then once you get out past two drinks per week
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.480]   is when it gets into the gray zone
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.940]   where some people say it's good,
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.000]   some people say it's neutral,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.380]   some people say it's bad.
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.400]   But that once you get up past
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.360]   four or five servings of alcohol per week,
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.320]   it's pretty clear to me,
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.520]   it's not a good situation.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.120]   - Well, that was the prevailing theory until this year.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.720]   And I don't know if you've kept up,
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.180]   but in the past few months,
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.680]   there have been several articles published saying,
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:14.920]   no wine, no alcohol is good.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.660]   But then you have to balance that against the fact
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.760]   that alcohol for many people tends to relieve stress.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.880]   So if you're relieving stress,
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.760]   maybe it counteracts any adverse effects.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.280]   So complicated issue.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:34.280]   But my theory is moderation is the key to life
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:41.620]   and happiness also we know promotes longevity.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.000]   - Absolutely, I agree with you.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.680]   I'm not heavy-handed about the alcohol thing.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.080]   I always just say, do as you wish,
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.440]   but know what you're doing.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.320]   And I think many people who heard our podcast episode
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.200]   about alcohol, who stopped drinking alcohol
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.340]   or who elected to drink less did so, I'm told,
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:04.240]   because they really didn't enjoy it that much to begin with.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.960]   So it more or less gave them permission to drink less,
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.960]   not that they needed it, but they took it.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.880]   Anyway, I think it's a really interesting area.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.640]   As you mentioned, it probably lowers stress.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.080]   It probably also disrupts patterns of sleep
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.080]   in the gut microbiome.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.440]   So there's, you can't escape in biology.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.400]   There's always some modulatory influence on something else.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.840]   - Exactly.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.000]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.520]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.480]   By now, most of you have heard me tell my story
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.160]   about how I've been taking AG1 once or twice a day,
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.840]   every day since 2012.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.280]   And indeed that's true.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.560]   I started taking AG1 and I still take AG1
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.200]   once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.120]   and minerals that I might not be getting enough of
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.780]   from whole foods that I eat,
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.680]   as well as adaptogens and micronutrients.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.060]   And those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.680]   because even though I strive to eat most of my foods
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.600]   from unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods,
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.640]   it's often hard to do so,
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.520]   especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.760]   So by drinking a packet of AG1 in the morning
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.080]   and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.060]   I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.880]   I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.880]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1 regularly,
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.440]   just report feeling better.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.720]   And that shouldn't be surprising
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.000]   because it supports gut health.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.640]   And of course, gut health supports immune system health
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.640]   and brain health.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.760]   And it's supporting a ton of different cellular
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.240]   and organ processes that all interact with one another.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.000]   So while certain supplements are really directed
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.560]   towards one specific outcome,
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.720]   like sleeping better or being more alert,
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.080]   AG1 really is foundational nutritional support.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.380]   It's really designed to support all of the systems
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.600]   of your brain and body that relate to mental health
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.600]   and physical health.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.880]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.260]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.700]   to claim a special offer.
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.100]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,

[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.560]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.960]   Speaking of lifestyle factors,
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.920]   anytime we hear about traumatic brain injury or concussion,
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.920]   people immediately seem to think about football.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:08.380]   But I'm told by colleagues of ours in neurosurgery
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.160]   at Stanford and in neuroengineering
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.840]   that most head injuries are not from football.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.760]   They're not even from sport.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.080]   They're from construction work accidents.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.660]   They're from car accidents.
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:23.480]   What is your take on, you know, somebody, let's say,
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.640]   God forbid, gets rear-ended in a car accident.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.520]   Maybe gets whiplash.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.560]   Maybe they're feeling a little off.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.840]   Like maybe they have a minor concussion.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.560]   Maybe there was some movement of the brain
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.080]   that wasn't good.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.080]   What's the going consensus on how to deal with that?
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.080]   Sleep more,
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.680]   but then they tell you not to sleep excessively.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.820]   Should people take blood thinning agents?
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.800]   I mean, obviously avoid alcohol
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.200]   or certainly don't get another head injury anytime soon.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.100]   But, you know, what do we know about TBI and concussion
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.320]   that can help people move through that period
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.400]   in the weeks and months afterwards
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.880]   where it's really scary, you know,
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.600]   if you've ever had a hard head hit, you know,
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.160]   and they go, they might scan you.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.620]   They might not see a bleed,
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.060]   but it's kind of scary when you feel a little bit off
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.280]   because you've been hit in the head.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.500]   - Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.640]   And there's a lot of interesting concussion now.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.560]   I got very involved in this back in the '90s
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.860]   'cause I was the 49ers neurosurgeon for a decade
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.780]   from 1990 to 2000.
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.200]   - How were they doing at that point?
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.800]   I remember the dynasty of the '80s
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.840]   or the '90s are good.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.680]   - Oh, they were in Super Bowl contention.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.080]   In fact, I took care of Steve Young.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.280]   - Yeah, he's a local guy.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.640]   - Yeah, Steve's a great guy.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.700]   And Steve, a really smart guy.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:42.880]   In fact, he has a law degree from Brigham Young.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.580]   Steve was quarterback then
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.540]   and they were in Super Bowl contention
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:51.320]   and Steve had had some concussions
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:55.520]   and I actually sent him back to play when he recovered.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.460]   So you can examine someone
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:01.820]   and get a decent idea
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.700]   of how they're recovering from a concussion.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:09.700]   Steve unfortunately had a bad concussion at one point
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.840]   and he ended up retiring,
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.480]   which was the smartest thing I think for him in the end.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:18.120]   And he's become very involved with studying concussions
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:23.120]   and trying to figure out better ways to diagnose them,
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.680]   prevent the sequelae for football players,
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.600]   including changes in equipment
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:32.120]   and in tackling and that kind of thing.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:37.000]   But concussion is, we've learned a lot since the 1990s.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   At that time, concussion was not known,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.520]   even repeated concussion, to cause CTE,
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.000]   chronic traumatic encephalopathy in football players.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   CTE, which became a hot topic, was known only in boxers.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.840]   So I became very well informed at the time about concussions
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.600]   and there was surprisingly little known.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.960]   Soccer players had a high incidence of concussion
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:06.800]   at that time.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.040]   It wasn't known if there were long-term sequelae.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.920]   And usually there are not long-term sequelae
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:16.400]   as long as you don't get repeated concussions.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:22.640]   So now what we generally recommend
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.220]   if someone has a concussion,
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:28.280]   we usually get an MR scan if it's severe.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:32.000]   MR scans usually don't show anything.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.480]   They would show a contusion
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.700]   if there's any bruising of the brain,
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:40.560]   but they don't show the molecular abnormalities
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.520]   that occur with a concussion.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:46.000]   So the best way to figure out how severe it is
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.560]   and when a person has recovered
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.240]   is to do more sophisticated neurologic testing.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.840]   Eye tracking is a very sensitive way
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:00.840]   to detect problems with the brain after a concussion
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.600]   because you won't track as well.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.840]   And in fact, many sports, football, hockey,
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:12.840]   are incorporating pre-season eye tracking testing.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.360]   - I see, to get a baseline.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.560]   - To get a baseline.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.280]   Of course, some of the players will game the system
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.720]   because they still don't wanna be taken out.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.280]   So they may try to perform not as well as they could.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.480]   - On their eye tracking?
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.320]   - Yeah, on their--
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.520]   - I see, they throw the test.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.480]   - They throw the test so their baseline is,
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.680]   I mean, I don't think that's very common,
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.160]   but that's a way you can game the system.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.400]   But as long as it's performed well,
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.320]   that's a very good way of detecting
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.040]   subtle problems with the brain.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.320]   You're a vision scientist,
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:50.320]   so you understand how important all the circuits are
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.560]   in terms of, and the visual system is unique
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:00.040]   because it tests the brain from the retina
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.920]   all the way back to the occipital lobe.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.400]   So it's the whole longitudinal access
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.720]   of the brain that's being tested.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.520]   - Yeah, I'm always struck by,
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.440]   when I see these newsreel highlights of,
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.400]   a player goes down, they stay down,
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:20.080]   and then they're helped up and everyone cheers,
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.040]   and then they might hobble off, take a few moments,
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.080]   and then how are they gauging the decision
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.160]   to put the person back in?
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.320]   And the reason it's perplexing to me
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.440]   how they would determine that is that,
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.240]   you and I both know that the neurons,
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:36.280]   the nerve cells in the brain very likely could be injured,
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:40.040]   maybe even on their way to death after a head injury,
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.600]   but that the actual dying off of the tissue
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.280]   could take several minutes, hours, maybe even days.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.240]   So putting someone back in to get hit more,
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.440]   seems really risky, but at the same time,
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.320]   that's their profession, that's their choice.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.480]   And so you don't necessarily wanna make the decision
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.720]   to take someone out of a game or a job,
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.960]   or have them stop driving
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.840]   if they don't actually need to stop.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:04.960]   So it's a tricky thing.
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:08.880]   - It is tricky, and I think we have better methods of,
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.720]   even at the, if you're talking about sports,
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.840]   on the sideline of doing testing,
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.880]   there are neurosurgeons there now
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.380]   who are part of the process.
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:23.380]   As far as recovering in general,
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.880]   it's good to not stress the brain,
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:30.820]   but total absence of sensory information,
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:33.900]   sensory deprivation for long periods is not a good idea.
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:36.220]   - Or just staying home in the dark with sunglasses on,
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.180]   also not a good idea.
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.020]   - Exactly.
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:40.340]   So you wanna make sure the brain still has input,
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.420]   but you don't wanna overstress it
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:45.260]   when you're recovering from a concussion.
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.780]   - Sounds like doing all the things
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.980]   to keep blood pressure relatively low,
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.060]   LDL cholesterol relatively low.
[00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.440]   So interesting what you said earlier,
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.460]   that statins might be vascular protective
[00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:59.260]   even in the absence of high cholesterol.
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.780]   - Yeah, there's a lot of good evidence for that.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.540]   In fact, some studies have suggested
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:06.300]   that taking statins reduces the risk of cognitive decline,
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.740]   including conditions like Alzheimer's.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:09.580]   - Interesting.
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.780]   I know that statins are a bit of a controversial topic
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.700]   among listeners because some people report,
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:16.900]   I think I have this right,
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.100]   that statins can give them a kind of a brain fog
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.500]   if they take the wrong one or excessive amounts.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.100]   I'm not challenging what you're saying.
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.100]   - No, no, no, it's still controversial.
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:28.180]   - I just hear the shouts in the comment section.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.940]   I don't take a statin, but my cholesterol is in check,
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.460]   but I'm hearing more and more
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.740]   about some of these benefits of statins.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.900]   - Yeah, yeah, and the information is still emerging.
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.700]   For a traumatic brain injury in general,
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:46.220]   not a good idea to take an aspirin
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.940]   as opposed to a stroke or a TIA.
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:50.500]   - Where you would want to take an aspirin.
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.260]   - Right, right, because if you have injuries,
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:54.580]   say you have a contusion to the brain
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:58.100]   and there's some traumatic damage,
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.820]   taking a blood thinner might cause that to worsen
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.540]   or cause a hemorrhage.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.460]   - What about caffeine?
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:04.940]   Is there any evidence that caffeine
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:06.580]   can increase stroke or ischemia?
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:09.020]   I like coffee and I like yerba mate tea,
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.660]   so I'd be reluctant to give it up,
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.100]   but I consume it in moderation.
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.860]   Is there any direct relationship there?
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.780]   - I don't know any relationship,
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.980]   unless you're taking so much
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.060]   that your blood pressure is sky high.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:20.980]   - My blood pressure tends to be pretty low.
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:25.300]   - Lots of benefits evidently to caffeine
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.700]   in terms of health.
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.020]   - I agree with you there.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.420]   I have a question about something
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:34.780]   that many people are starting to do now,
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.800]   which is to get exploratory MRI.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.420]   I actually did one of these.
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.580]   I wasn't gifted one.
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.820]   I just decided to bite the bullet and pay for it,
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:44.980]   is a whole body scan.
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.780]   They put me in the tube, did a MRI,
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.620]   get everything from tip to toe.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.060]   And I learned a few things.
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.780]   I learned that I have like a slight,
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:54.140]   I think it's L3 or L4 disc bulge.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.020]   That explained a little bit of like pseudo sciatica
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.500]   and I've been able to work around that
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:00.940]   and keep that strong.
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.280]   I learned that fortunately for me,
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.340]   I only have one white spot on the brain.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.340]   I was told that you could have one per decade.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.560]   I'm nearing 50, so I feel very lucky there,
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.140]   especially given that I've hit my head a few times,
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.320]   skateboarding and doing martial arts and things like that.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.700]   But, so I feel lucky,
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.380]   but I also know people that go in for these scans
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:21.740]   and get the report that, you know,
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:24.400]   they have a growth of some sort
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.020]   or they have multiple white spots
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:26.980]   as they're called on the brain,
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.740]   which is kind of damage to tissue, the neural tissue.
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:31.660]   You know, what is your thought
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:35.220]   on these exploratory/preventative scans?
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.340]   Do you think they're useful?
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:40.000]   Do you feel like they cause undue concern?
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:40.920]   I mean, this is a new thing,
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.580]   people going out and getting their brain scanned.
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.480]   - Yeah, and people are getting total body scans.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:49.120]   So I think there are benefits and risks involved.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.160]   So the benefit is that you might pick up
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.720]   something that should be treated,
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:58.720]   like an early cancer or a large aneurysm in the brain,
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:02.000]   which would have a higher chance to bleed.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.880]   But many times, and I see patients all the time
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:08.340]   who are referred for a tiny aneurysm,
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:11.280]   blister on a blood vessel in the brain
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:14.500]   that was found incidentally on a total body scan.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:18.860]   And these aneurysms, which can be one or two millimeters,
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:21.980]   sometimes we don't even consider those as real aneurysms,
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:26.360]   they don't need to be treated in most cases.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:31.080]   And so it's a little controversial
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.800]   because people can be worried about them,
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.720]   even if they're reassured.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.520]   Other examples are you find something in the brain
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.240]   or elsewhere in the body, not sure what it is.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.000]   And then in order to determine what it is,
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.120]   patients start having more invasive biopsies and tests,
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:50.120]   which can lead to what we call iatrogenic injuries.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.840]   That's, iatrogenic is caused by the physicians.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.560]   So I think you have to be very thoughtful
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:01.560]   when you interpret the results of these total body
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.760]   or even brain scans.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:09.480]   And I would recommend talking with a specialist about it
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:13.000]   if you're concerned.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.680]   But people wonder, I have this,
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.800]   we were discussing it earlier today actually
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.640]   with one of your colleagues.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:26.640]   And what if you're found to have a 1.75 millimeter aneurysm,
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.220]   if it's really even an aneurysm,
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:31.200]   should you change your lifestyle?
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.280]   And for something like that, I would recommend, no,
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.400]   you should forget about it, get a follow-up scan,
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.920]   but you may very well live and die with this little blister
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.160]   that is of no consequence.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.800]   So as I say, I think you have to be careful
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:51.800]   about how you interpret and how you act on these findings.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.720]   - Maybe we can talk about lifestyle factors
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.920]   because I think anyone listening to this is gonna think,
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.720]   I don't want a stroke, I don't want transient ischemic attack,
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.960]   I don't want hemorrhage, I don't want any of this stuff.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.240]   And we already discussed a little bit
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.480]   about how what's good for your heart
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.280]   generally is good for the brain.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.480]   But I think most people strive to eat well,
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.340]   meaning not excessively, also not undereat,
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:17.600]   to hopefully eat a lot of unprocessed
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   or minimally processed foods and to avoid smoking perhaps,
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:29.840]   avoid alcohol in excess, avoid hard drugs, get exercise.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.360]   And so, I think people generally try
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:34.920]   and do all these things, get good sleep, et cetera.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.720]   But at some level, I think everyone also wants to know,
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:44.320]   when are they in their safest kind of shape
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.560]   for avoiding a stroke?
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.240]   Is there sort of a blood pressure cutoff
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.600]   where we could say, okay, if you keep your blood pressure,
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:54.600]   resting blood pressure below blank, you're doing pretty well.
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.260]   And if your cholesterol is below blank,
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.100]   you're doing pretty well.
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:02.100]   And then you just, while keeping moderation in mind,
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.860]   try and live a life that reduces the probability
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:09.060]   of getting a stroke or some other
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.560]   blood-related neural attack.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:14.300]   - Well, I think it has to be individualized to some extent.
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:18.740]   And over time, the standards and the guidelines have changed.
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:21.820]   It used to be, if your systolic blood pressure,
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:26.820]   that's the upper number, was under 130, 130 or under,
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:30.820]   that was considered normal and it would not lead to problems.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:35.820]   Now, the guidelines suggest that 120 or lower is better
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:39.380]   in large studies.
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:44.380]   But as an example, when my blood pressure gets under 120,
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:46.660]   I feel lightheaded.
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:51.580]   In fact, I had an event about 15 years ago
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:55.700]   when I was overdoing it, like I shouldn't have been.
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:56.900]   - Overdoing exercise or overdoing?
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:57.860]   - Overdoing everything.
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.260]   I was in my, I was fifth.
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:01.460]   - A Stanford faculty member that overdoes something?
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:03.140]   That was a joke that among Stanford faculty.
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:08.140]   - I was 56 and I operated all day in two operating rooms.
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:13.460]   I got done early, it was in the spring,
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:15.580]   and I took a run up to the dish.
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:18.780]   And then I took a red-eye to Houston for a meeting.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:22.140]   And I emailed on the flight, got an hour or two of sleep,
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:25.100]   went to the meeting, was fine.
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:28.100]   It was a stroke meeting with a bunch of scientists,
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:33.220]   neurologists and scientists who were about 120 people.
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:36.100]   There were two neurosurgeons there, plus me.
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.100]   And drank some coffee.
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:42.060]   At noon, I went for a run 'cause I like running.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:44.180]   And at that day in Houston,
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:49.180]   it was 90 degrees and 85% humidity.
[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:54.180]   And got back, had a glass of tea,
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:56.460]   went back to the meeting, had some more coffee.
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:59.180]   And then as the afternoon session opened up,
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.260]   I started to feel lightheaded.
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:04.620]   And next thing I know, I'm looking up at the chandelier
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:09.620]   and they're shouting stroke, cardiac arrest, seizure,
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:12.500]   and they're starting to pump on my chest.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:14.820]   So they rushed me to the hospital
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:18.060]   where I had a simultaneous workup
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:20.860]   for cardiac arrest and stroke.
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:24.260]   And after, I'll make the story short,
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:29.260]   after $100,000 workup, it was determined I had a faint
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:33.420]   because I was overdoing it.
[00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:37.500]   So since then, now I try to get seven
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.740]   to eight hours sleep a night.
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:40.700]   - Great, that's clearly the bedrock of health.
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:41.540]   - So I increased.
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:44.220]   I used to get three to five hours sleep a night.
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:47.340]   Now I get seven to nine if I can do it.
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:50.700]   Cut back on coffee, on caffeine.
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:55.580]   And I don't push myself to exercise like I used to
[00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:57.460]   if I'm feeling a little fatigued.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.480]   I'm on an antihypertensive agent,
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.780]   but I actually don't take it every day
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:06.780]   because for me, it's better to have a pressure 125 to 135.
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:10.660]   And it's true for some of my patients.
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:13.580]   If you've got some disease in your arteries,
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.700]   you may not wanna have such a low blood pressure.
[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:17.120]   So I would individualize it.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:20.780]   But in general, you wanna take care of your body
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.500]   like I've learned and probably,
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.180]   maybe you've learned over time.
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.020]   - I'm learning.
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:26.980]   I mean, this is very interesting.
[00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:29.180]   I tend to have low blood pressure.
[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:31.980]   It sort of runs in my family to have low blood pressure.
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:38.340]   I can definitely relate to the hard driving
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.700]   ambition phenotype.
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:42.740]   I think it's worth people hearing this
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:44.540]   because it's characteristic of a lot of people
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:46.100]   in high intensity professions.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:47.800]   And I made the joke about Stanford faculty,
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.660]   but it's true.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:50.940]   I think that if you're ambitious,
[00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.860]   you tend to overdo a bit more.
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:54.500]   That's something I'm certainly working on.
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:57.220]   And I've run a very busy life
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:00.460]   and learning to slow down, prioritize sleep,
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:03.740]   prioritize meditation, non-sleep deep rest
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:05.740]   is something I've benefited from a lot.
[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:07.140]   Journaling, things of that sort
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.940]   that really just kind of slow the pace.
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:13.660]   I think that in the landscape of health optimization,
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:16.840]   we can often put ourselves into modes of excess
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:17.980]   in the other direction,
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:23.240]   meaning doing so much to try and avoid issues with health
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:25.100]   that we end up creating issues with health.
[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.020]   But yeah, certainly reducing caffeine intake
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.160]   and prioritizing sleep are key.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.820]   So I appreciate that you shared that story.
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:34.020]   So if somebody has naturally low blood pressure
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:36.000]   and starts to feel a bit,
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.660]   let's just say kind of sleepy or woozy in the afternoon,
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:41.540]   would you recommend that they obviously
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:44.920]   not take a pressure-lowering drug,
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:48.260]   but that they add a bit of salt to their diet,
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:53.260]   that they feel free to exercise less?
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:55.260]   I'm a little bit confused.
[00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:57.180]   I also love to run and do resistance training.
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:59.140]   - Well, I would recommend they take their blood pressure.
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:02.700]   So you want to try to correlate any symptoms you're having
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:05.540]   with vital signs that you modify, right?
[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:08.220]   So take your blood pressure if you're feeling faint.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:12.540]   If it's low, one thing you can do easily is to hydrate.
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:13.460]   That was something else.
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:14.700]   I used to not drink much
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:18.040]   because I don't want to have to pee in the operating room.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.420]   - I can imagine that'd be pretty uncomfortable.
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:21.240]   I don't want to be the patient that you're operating on
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.540]   when you have to go use the bathroom.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:25.300]   - Yeah, so now, and then I'll reveal
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:30.300]   that I had a kidney stone, which is common among surgeons.
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.740]   This was a decade ago.
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:37.100]   And since then, I hydrate all the time.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.300]   So I hydrate to the point
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:40.740]   that my urine is crystal clear all the time.
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:43.300]   - And that helps with some of the brain clarity.
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.140]   So interesting.
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:44.960]   I've done a little bit of work
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:46.980]   with people in the special operations community.
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:48.820]   And I think people hear about them and they think,
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:51.380]   oh, you know, what's the magic potion that they're taking?
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:52.220]   What are they doing?
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:55.160]   And they do a number of very interesting things.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:59.380]   But one of them is they really emphasize hydration.
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:01.460]   They're just like hydration, water,
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:02.760]   sometimes water with electrolytes
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:05.020]   if they're working in hot conditions,
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:05.860]   but just hydration, hydration, hydration.
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:09.700]   - I was skeptical and I used to dehydrate.
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:12.020]   I felt better dehydrated and fit, you know,
[00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:17.020]   but as I've matured, I think it's very, very important.
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:20.580]   And for, you know, for your blood pressure,
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:24.420]   for your general health and for your kidneys.
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:26.020]   - Yeah, you mentioned sleep.
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:26.900]   Is there a relationship
[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.200]   between sleep deprivation and stroke risk?
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.980]   - That's a great question.
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:34.140]   There's, interestingly,
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:37.680]   strokes occur more commonly during sleep.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.260]   It's not known why.
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:43.320]   One theory is that it's related to circadian rhythms.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:46.700]   I don't know if there's a relationship
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:51.700]   between sleep deprivation and stroke.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.360]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:56.060]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Element.
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.380]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:58.780]   that has everything you need.
[00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.780]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:03.380]   and potassium in the correct amounts and ratios,
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.700]   and nothing you don't, which means no sugar.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.420]   Now, I and others on this podcast
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:09.700]   have talked about the critical importance of hydration
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.300]   for proper brain and body functioning.
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.220]   Even a slight degree of dehydration
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.720]   can diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.020]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:21.000]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.200]   are critical for the functioning
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.700]   of all the cells in your body,
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.780]   especially your neurons, your nerve cells.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:27.220]   Drinking Element dissolved in water
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.580]   makes it very easy to ensure
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:30.380]   that you're getting adequate hydration
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.960]   and adequate electrolytes.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.440]   To make sure I'm getting proper amounts
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.180]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:37.000]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.020]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.240]   when I wake up in the morning,
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.740]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.860]   I'll also drink Element dissolved in water
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.780]   during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.140]   especially in hot days when I'm sweating a lot,
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:51.180]   losing water and electrolytes.
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.100]   They have a bunch of different
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:53.780]   great-tasting flavors of Element.
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:55.340]   My favorite is the watermelon,
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.900]   although I confess I also like the raspberry and the citrus.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:59.920]   Basically, I like all the flavors.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.400]   And Element has also just released
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.460]   a new line of canned sparkling Element.
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.220]   So these aren't the packets you dissolve in water.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.580]   These are cans of Element that you crack open
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.920]   like any other canned drink, like a soda,
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.220]   but you're getting your hydration
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.120]   and your electrolytes with no sugar.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.260]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:15.860]   you can go to drinkelement,
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:19.140]   spelled L-M-N-T dot com slash Huberman,
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:20.780]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.620]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.660]   Again, that's drinkelement.com slash Huberman
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.700]   to claim a free sample pack.
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:29.440]   I'm gonna tell a horror story,
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.260]   but not, I want to repeat, not to demonize chiropractors.
[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:36.180]   Here's the positive story.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:39.540]   I had a back thing, my back hurt,
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.300]   and I wasn't sure what I needed to do.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:45.020]   And a chiropractor gave me some exercises to do
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:48.700]   that essentially were like the up-dog movement in yoga
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:51.260]   that my understanding is it helped the disc bulge
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:53.360]   kind of work its way back into the spinal column.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.060]   And it worked terrifically well.
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.420]   I took no medication.
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:58.100]   I required no surgery.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.020]   And I eventually learned to correct some imbalances
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:03.480]   that have led me to not have that issue again.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.380]   It was really remarkable.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:09.140]   And this chiropractor essentially saved me from surgery.
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:11.460]   And I'm forever grateful.
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:14.880]   So I think there are excellent chiropractors out there.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.180]   But when I was a postdoc living in San Francisco,
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:21.740]   I had a roommate, I believe she was a neurology resident,
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:24.020]   and she came back from the clinic at UCSF.
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.700]   And she told me this story that a patient had come in
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.680]   who was experiencing some hemiparalysis of the face.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.740]   That patient, I believe it was a young woman,
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:36.540]   had gone for a neck adjustment or head adjustment
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:37.380]   at a chiropractor.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.740]   - She ended up with a dissection of her artery.
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:39.940]   - Right, and something had happened,
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.260]   and she had essentially a stroke.
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:45.340]   And so I share both these stories to make very clear
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.900]   that I have nothing against chiropractors,
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:50.180]   but I think like any health practitioners,
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:51.780]   they come in a range of talents.
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:57.060]   And this was really, like for me, an alarm.
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.380]   And I decided at that point,
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:01.340]   I would never allow a chiropractor to adjust my neck.
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:03.540]   I said, okay, you can make adjustments to my back,
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:05.620]   you can give me suggestions about exercises to do,
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.620]   but how common are these?
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:11.100]   You said it's a hemi-dissection?
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:13.100]   - It's a dissection of an artery,
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:15.820]   either the vertebral artery in the back
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:19.700]   or the carotid artery up closer in the front.
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.260]   - So no cutting when you say dissection,
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.460]   they're basically making an adjustment, yeah.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:26.260]   - Well, what happens is, and I agree with,
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.620]   and we're on the same page.
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:30.900]   I recommend patients, if they're gonna have chiropractory,
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.340]   not to have manipulation of their neck,
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:34.180]   'cause that's what occurs.
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:38.420]   It's not common, but I see it, we see it.
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:42.460]   What happens is the artery is damaged.
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:46.020]   The manipulation of moving the bone in the soft tissues
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:50.820]   causes a tear in the wall of the artery.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:53.460]   And what occurs, interestingly,
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:56.580]   is that the blood that's usually in the space,
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:59.180]   the lumen, the middle of the artery,
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:03.140]   gets into the wall and causes a false lumen,
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:07.780]   a false passage, and that blood in the wall
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:11.500]   pushes part of the wall into the main artery,
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:16.500]   obstructing flow and sometimes causing a clot to form
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.220]   that can be dislodged and go up to the brain.
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:20.060]   - Yikes.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.540]   So, and there's no way to know
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:24.220]   whether or not this is gonna happen.
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:28.860]   - No, that's why I recommend not having neck manipulation
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:30.100]   by a chiropractor.
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:35.100]   Even if it's rare, it's so devastating when it occurs
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:38.080]   that, personally, I would avoid that.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.420]   - Yes, I tell the chiropractor,
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.880]   "Stay away from anything above the shoulders, please."
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.940]   And then the back work has been beneficial.
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.060]   Again, these exercises,
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.560]   perhaps the most beneficial thing about it.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.400]   As long as we're there,
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.980]   I realize it's a bit of a niche condition,
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.400]   but what about hanging upside down?
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.060]   I had one of these inversion tables.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.460]   I really enjoyed that thing.
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.300]   But then once I looked at my camera phone
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.260]   while I was hanging upside down,
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:04.140]   and it looked like I was gonna blow a gasket
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.100]   from all the vasculature in my forehead.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.860]   Is it bad to hang upside down?
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.700]   - No evidence that it's bad.
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:10.820]   - Oh, good, oh, good.
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:13.400]   Maybe I'll get an inversion table again.
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:14.940]   As long as you don't stay there, of course.
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:16.660]   You got, okay, great.
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.420]   Would you let your kids play football or rugby?
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:22.380]   - That's a great question.
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.860]   I would not.
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.100]   That's my personal decision.
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:26.620]   I think there are a lot of benefits
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:31.620]   to children playing football, rugby, like any sport.
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:32.980]   It's a team sport.
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.780]   A lot of good skills are learned
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:41.340]   besides just the physicality of it, the coordination,
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:44.540]   but being a team player and the socialization.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:48.420]   But I think, talking about tackle football,
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:52.980]   I think the risk, there is still risk.
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.260]   We're just learning about it.
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:57.460]   And even high school players
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:02.460]   who many years ago were found to have multiple concussions
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:06.900]   are showing up when they're doing autopsies
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.520]   with some of this chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:13.660]   I wanted to play football as a kid,
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:14.980]   and I'm not that big.
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.080]   I mean, I'm a big guy.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.500]   And my parents didn't let me, which is fortunate
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:25.500]   because I'm sure I would have been put at risk for injuries,
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:29.300]   not just head injuries, other injuries.
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.660]   My son, who's a very good athlete,
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:36.040]   he played four years of high school baseball and soccer,
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.940]   was asked to try out for the quarterback position
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.700]   his senior year.
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:42.820]   And we went out to try out,
[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:47.820]   and he decided, with my encouragement, not to play.
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:49.660]   - Did he go to Gunn High School?
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.960]   - Yeah, he went to Menlo.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.300]   - Okay, I went to Gunn.
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.860]   Our football team was, at that time, was bad enough
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:56.680]   that there was no incentive to play.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.320]   What about soccer and heading the ball?
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.740]   I've actually heard that can be problematic,
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:01.300]   which to me, at first, when I heard that,
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.780]   I was like, "Nah, there's no way."
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.180]   I mean, the ball is so light.
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:06.260]   But is there any evidence that repeated heading the ball?
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.200]   - There is.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:11.420]   Again, it's not incontrovertible,
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:15.260]   but there is some evidence that multiple headings
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:20.260]   can cause some concussions and some long-term injury.
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:24.140]   Again, when I studied this in detail
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:29.980]   as a 49ers neurosurgeon back in the '90s,
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.740]   there was very little data,
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:34.060]   although there was some evidence even then
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:38.020]   that soccer players had a high incidence,
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.620]   particularly female soccer players
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.740]   had a high incident of concussion, surprisingly.
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:46.340]   But now there's much more evidence that head injuries
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:50.460]   and even heading the ball may lead to some injury.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:55.580]   - I feel like if a sport is not your profession,
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:59.380]   the risk-benefit analysis is pretty clear.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.940]   Like, why box?
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:03.140]   I understand it's a great sport.
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:05.060]   There's a lot to learn there.
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.420]   Done a little bit of it in the past,
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.980]   but unless you're gonna get paid
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:10.380]   substantial amounts of money,
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:13.020]   and maybe even then, it's probably not worth it.
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.300]   - Well, I feel the same way.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.220]   It is different for professional athletes.
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:18.700]   I mean, this is their job.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:23.060]   I remember talking with Steve Young at one point
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:27.140]   about continuing to play or finally deciding to retire.
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:30.980]   And I was thinking, what if I was asked
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:34.860]   to retire as a neurosurgeon at the prime of my career?
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:39.300]   It's your profession.
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:40.420]   It's your income.
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:43.660]   It's how you identify yourself.
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:48.100]   Your self-esteem is dependent on it.
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.540]   Your family maybe put pressure on you
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.060]   as a professional athlete.
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:55.300]   If you're not a professional athlete,
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:58.860]   I think for me, and this is my own opinion individually,
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:02.580]   I think there's less of a controversy,
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:05.620]   and there's so many other sports
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:09.620]   which benefit in the same way
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:13.500]   as football or boxing.
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:18.060]   Why not participate in those?
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:21.820]   That's my feeling, but I know it's a controversial subject.
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:23.180]   - Maybe we can circle back a little bit
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.740]   on a fairly common scenario.
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:29.300]   You're in the attic and you're looking for something,
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:31.820]   you stand up, boom, you hit your head on a beam
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.380]   and you're kind of dizzy for a bit.
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:37.140]   Or recently our podcast team was on tour in Australia
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:40.220]   and the way that the shelf over the kitchen sink
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.820]   in our Airbnb was arranged,
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:45.060]   it was certain that everyone pretty much
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:48.340]   would hit their head hard on that thing at some point.
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:52.140]   Does one need to worry about one kind of dizzy-inducing
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:55.820]   head hit from everyday life?
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.220]   I think a lot of people are kind of scared,
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.180]   like do they do brain damage
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:01.980]   or is the evolutionary adaptation,
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.580]   which is the thick skull,
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.780]   sufficient to keep us safe in most cases?
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.660]   - I don't think you need to worry in general,
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.300]   especially if your symptoms resolve
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.380]   within a relatively short period of time.
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:15.060]   - Such as how long, a day or two?
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.620]   - Yeah, I mean, even if you have a mild concussion
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:20.380]   and you recover within a day or two,
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:24.300]   I don't think there's any need to worry or get a scan.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.860]   And it's a commonplace occurrence.
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:29.820]   - Yeah, I think your answer will set a lot of minds at ease
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.580]   because people do worry.
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.780]   I mean, there's something so mysterious
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:36.100]   about the stuff that occurs inside the cranial vault.
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:39.580]   We can't look to something, we can't take our pulse.
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:44.060]   It's so hard to know what's going on in there.
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:44.900]   - Well, as you say,
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:47.300]   that's why we develop very thick skulls
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.700]   to protect the most important organ.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:52.920]   - Because after all the tissue doesn't regenerate,
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:53.760]   at least not much of it.
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.820]   There are a few areas where there are neurons
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:56.820]   that can replenish.
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:00.460]   - You know, I'm gonna take issue with you at that
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.380]   because the prior notion, of course,
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:06.760]   was that once nerve cells in the brain die,
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.440]   they don't regenerate.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.780]   And for a long time it was thought
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:13.340]   you don't produce any new nerve cells,
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:14.980]   any new stem cells in the brain.
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:19.340]   And we used to think after an injury
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:22.620]   or a disease like a stroke,
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.040]   when that tissue was damaged and you were paralyzed
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.080]   or you couldn't talk, that there was no way to recover,
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.300]   that those circuits were dead.
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:32.560]   It turns out that is not true.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.320]   And we are learning that, I think, in recent years.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.320]   When I trained, there was no hope to restore function
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:44.440]   in patients who had a stroke, traumatic brain injury,
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:49.440]   spinal cord injury, and other diseases,
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:54.020]   ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, Parkinson's disease.
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:58.900]   Now we are learning that there is hope.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:03.180]   We know that stem cells do form in the adult brain.
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:06.140]   That's not controversial anymore.
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.660]   We know that other circuits can take over
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:10.740]   for circuits that were dead.
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:13.380]   And we know now, and this is some of the work
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:15.640]   that we're doing with chronic stroke patients
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:18.980]   who we thought could not recover after six months at all,
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:23.980]   we know that there are ways of promoting regeneration
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.760]   or recovery of function.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.820]   We're still working out the details of that.
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:33.220]   But for instance, we've done studies,
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:38.220]   and this is still in clinical trial phase,
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:41.700]   with patients who are years out from a stroke,
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.180]   they've been through rehab,
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:46.680]   they've been through physical therapy,
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:51.380]   and 90% or more of recovery after a stroke
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.780]   occurs in the first six months.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:56.060]   After that time, you know patients are not gonna recover.
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:00.360]   And now we are finding in some of our early trials
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:03.420]   with patients that if you, for instance,
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:06.200]   put in stem cells into the brain,
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:12.180]   or if you, another treatment which was approved by the FDA,
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:13.900]   the very first for chronic stroke,
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:17.460]   if you put a stimulator on the vagus nerve in the neck
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:22.460]   and stimulate, coupled with physical therapy,
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:24.980]   intensive physical therapy,
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:28.220]   you can improve arm function in those patients.
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:31.100]   In our patients that we've treated in multiple trials,
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:35.220]   we're seeing early indications that patients years out
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:40.220]   from a stroke can start to recover function in their arms,
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:43.040]   in their legs, in their speech.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.260]   And we don't know all the mechanisms,
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:48.140]   but the old notion that these circuits are dead
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.980]   is simply not true.
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:52.180]   They can be resurrected.
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:56.060]   And so, you know, this is part of the excitement
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:00.180]   about discovery and doing research
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:03.140]   and trying to translate into the clinical arena.
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:04.580]   - Yeah, oftentimes this boils down
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:06.940]   to really critical of the moment decisions.
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:10.900]   I'll tell a story, I won't reveal the hospital
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.040]   or the exact players involved.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.820]   But some years ago, an ex-girlfriend of mine,
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:21.240]   who then was just somebody I was friends with slash dating,
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:25.480]   contacted me and said that her dad had had a stroke.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.660]   And I was near that hospital.
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:31.680]   So I went and spoke to the resident
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.960]   and the resident who was overseeing the case
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.560]   essentially said, look, it's hopeless.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.860]   There's a huge necrotic piece of tissue in there.
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:41.240]   The probability of any kind of quality of life
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.740]   is essentially zero.
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.240]   My suggestion, and I was there
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.800]   as the resident made the suggestion,
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:50.960]   would be to remove him from life support, essentially.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.120]   And the other members of the family were like,
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:53.960]   oh my goodness, right?
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.720]   This is not a situation anyone wants to be in.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.400]   I made a couple of calls,
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.300]   including to someone who's previously been a guest
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.880]   on this podcast, who's highly qualified
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:05.980]   to know about this sort of thing.
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.040]   They asked a couple of questions
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.960]   about the location of the stroke,
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.460]   which side of the brain it was on,
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:12.700]   and said, keep him alive.
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.880]   There's a good chance that he'll have
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.760]   some degree of recovery of function.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.000]   So that's what they did.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   And indeed, while he lost some motor abilities,
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.200]   lost some speech abilities,
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.140]   and has some disruption of affect,
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:28.200]   where he'll sort of spontaneously laugh or cry
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:31.400]   from time to time, he has, at least by my observation,
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:34.320]   been able to enjoy substantial amounts of life,
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.840]   interacting with grandkids, enjoying holidays,
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.320]   and actually took, I was told,
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.400]   some physical steps at some point,
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.720]   with assistance, with a walker.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:45.240]   He's done a lot of physical rehab.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.480]   Obviously, a really hard situation,
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.440]   but it told me that oftentimes,
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.480]   when we think that all is lost, not all is lost,
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.960]   even in people in their 70s.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.860]   - Right, it has to do with plasticity.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:04.380]   And we all wish we were neonates or infants,
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:08.040]   because the body, including the brain, is so plastic.
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:10.840]   That's the ability to regenerate tissue
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.480]   and circuits and recover.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:17.480]   So if an infant has a stroke and is paralyzed on one side,
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.880]   usually they can make an excellent,
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.400]   if not complete, recovery.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:24.740]   - This is the, as I recall from my undergraduate years,
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:25.980]   the Kennard principle.
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:27.100]   If you're gonna have a brain injury,
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.040]   have it early in life.
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:28.880]   - Exactly.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.760]   So, I mean, you notice this too.
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:34.740]   When I cut myself now, it can take a week
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:35.900]   for that cut to heal.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:38.500]   When my granddaughter, who's six years old,
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.540]   cuts herself the next day, it's totally healed.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:42.780]   - So little kids are like salamanders, right?
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:45.740]   They almost, by the way, that was a biology joke.
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:47.260]   They're not like salamanders.
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:50.900]   But salamanders can regenerate entire limbs
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:52.980]   by the maintenance of a small stem cell population
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:57.980]   at the tip of the limb bud, or what would be the limb bud.
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:02.480]   And it is remarkable how kids can regenerate without a scar.
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.000]   They can oftentimes, they can't grow an entire hand back,
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.240]   but it's kind of striking how much plasticity there is.
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.040]   - And that's what we're trying to develop,
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.960]   are new ways of promoting plasticity
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.760]   in the adult brain, as an example.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:18.760]   So we think stem cells injected through various mechanisms,
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:24.120]   stimulation of the brain, or the vagal nerve, as an example,
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.720]   can promote plasticity.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.980]   In a sense, we think what's happening
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:33.940]   is that these methods can turn the adult brain
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:36.500]   into an infant brain, in some ways.
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:39.140]   - Where are the stem cells coming from in these experiments?
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.340]   - It depends.
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:41.500]   There are different sources.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:45.440]   So some of the studies I've done previously
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:49.460]   with other companies, they made the stem cells
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:54.460]   either from bone marrow donors, so they were mesenchymal,
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:00.520]   or another group made the cells from fetal neural tissue.
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:04.820]   - Okay, so just to orient people,
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.780]   inside the bone, you have the marrow.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:08.980]   Most people know that because they've ordered it
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:13.980]   at a restaurant, cow marrow, that is, typically.
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:18.100]   The cells within the marrow contain, as I recall,
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:20.180]   a hemopoietic population.
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:24.300]   So a population of sort of potential blood cells,
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.420]   cells that can become blood cells, or other things.
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.720]   And if taken out, put into a Petri dish,
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.320]   and given the appropriate factors,
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.680]   you can drive the fate of those stem cells
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.720]   to be, say, neurons, or cardiac cells.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.280]   And then you're taking those cells
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.120]   and you're injecting them into the brains of patients
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:45.060]   in the hopes that they will become neural cells,
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:47.080]   neurons that will incorporate into the circuitry.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.760]   - Actually, that was the initial notion 20 years ago
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:50.880]   when we started doing this,
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:55.560]   was that these cells you put in become,
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:58.100]   these exogenous cells you inject,
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:01.320]   become neurons, and astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes,
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.640]   all the cells in the brain,
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.360]   and that the neurons reconstitute circuits.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.320]   That is not how they work.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.800]   The way they work, and this is why it may not matter
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.340]   what particular type of stem cell you put in,
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:18.040]   the way they work, primarily,
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.960]   is by secreting very powerful proteins, molecules,
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:26.800]   growth factors that promote native recovery.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:30.200]   So they promote angiogenesis,
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.520]   they promote native neurogenesis,
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:36.040]   endogenous gliogenesis, synaptogenesis,
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.100]   but the main benefit may be
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:40.060]   that they modulate the immune system.
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:41.620]   That's what we're finding.
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:46.280]   So by modulating, somehow, the immune system in the brain,
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:50.240]   they are able to induce plasticity and recover function.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.120]   - Interesting.
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.660]   I'm tempted here to weave in the stories
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:54.960]   that date back to the '90s,
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.280]   but that we see more and more of,
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.540]   mostly studies in rodents, but a few in humans,
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:02.040]   showing that there are dormant stem cell populations
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.440]   in certain compartments of the brain,
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.040]   the dentate gyrus, or the hippocampus,
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.960]   the olfactory bulb, et cetera,
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.060]   that upon hyperoxygenation,
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:14.220]   or increasing blood flow to the brain,
[01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:16.660]   largely by virtue of exercise,
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:18.540]   but also sometimes by way of engaging
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:20.780]   in learning tasks and exercise,
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:23.340]   that you can basically cause the release of stem cells
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:25.260]   that normally would lie dormant.
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:28.660]   Is that literature reason enough
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:31.780]   to suggest that people who've had a stroke
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:34.920]   continue to move their body, to walk, get exercise,
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.020]   maybe do resistance training,
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:37.940]   maybe even some skill-related training?
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:41.940]   - Yes, there's a lot of evidence that activity,
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:45.500]   physical therapy, even forced activity,
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:46.700]   is very beneficial.
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:51.260]   And it's not just stimulating endogenous stem cells
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:54.380]   in the brain, but it's multiple mechanisms.
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:58.640]   It's recruiting circuits that were not involved before.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:02.420]   For instance, studies have been done on stroke patients
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:05.780]   who make a recovery show that
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:10.420]   not only is the side of the stroke improving in some cases,
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:13.140]   but the other side of the brain
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:15.900]   is showing increased activity.
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:18.540]   So circuits on the other side of the brain
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.540]   may be contributing to the recovery
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:24.160]   on the side of the stroke brain.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.500]   So it's much more complex than we thought it was.
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:31.940]   - Years ago, I developed an affection for a literature.
[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:34.400]   It wasn't a very prominent literature,
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.440]   but I found it really interesting,
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.820]   is the work of a guy named Timothy Schallert
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:40.580]   and Teresa Jones.
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:42.060]   - I know both of them. - Are you familiar with this?
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:44.700]   - Yeah, we almost recruited Tim to our department.
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:47.300]   - Yeah, the sort of overarching theme of this literature
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:49.260]   was it was animal work,
[01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:51.380]   but I think some of it might've been translated to humans,
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:52.740]   which was that, for instance,
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:55.260]   if somebody has damage on one side of the brain,
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:57.180]   because of the way the circuits are organized,
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:59.540]   and of course, you know this better than anyone, Gary,
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:02.300]   but that one might experience deficits in limb movement
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:03.940]   on the opposite side.
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:06.740]   And that the tendency for somebody like that
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:09.740]   is to then over rely on the intact limbs,
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:13.860]   essentially lean on the intact limbs.
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:15.660]   And the approach that they took
[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:19.340]   to try and recover function was really interesting.
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:21.640]   They had these animals,
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.740]   and I think eventually there was some human work done,
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:25.420]   I could be mistaken,
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:30.420]   sort of tie up the more active uninjured arm or leg or hand,
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:34.860]   such that they then had to rely on the non-dominant,
[01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:36.440]   or let's just call it injured,
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.660]   sometimes even flaccid paralysis limb.
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:42.020]   And in that way, they could generate a lot of plasticity
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:43.940]   that normally would escape the patient,
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:46.420]   especially in the days and weeks following the injury.
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.620]   Just forcing movement,
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:52.220]   or forcing the attempt to move of the injured pathway.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:54.340]   I find this literature to be so striking,
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:57.100]   and maybe one that should deserve more attention.
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.100]   - Yeah, it's called constraint therapy.
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.140]   And not only has it been shown
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:03.420]   in animal studies preclinically,
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:07.440]   but it's been shown in some clinical studies
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.180]   of patients with stroke.
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.000]   In fact, one of the trials we did
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.320]   with transplanting stem cells into the brain
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:17.880]   included restraining the good limb
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.400]   to force use of the other limb.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.600]   So there's some very intriguing data
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.040]   suggesting that that's important.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:30.040]   However, some of the animal studies also suggest
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.280]   that you may have to wait a time.
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.980]   If you force use of the involved limb too soon,
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:38.900]   it can be detrimental to the recovery.
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:39.740]   - I see.
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:43.340]   - So there may be an important temporal factor there
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:46.060]   in terms of the timing of when you do that.
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:50.180]   - Is there anything that people can do or take
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:53.020]   for neuroprotection after an injury
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:55.460]   to essentially try and rescue neurons
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:56.460]   that would otherwise die?
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.660]   - Right, so this is a very interesting subject.
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:04.340]   Back in the late 1980s, 1990s,
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:07.480]   a lot of emphasis was placed on trying
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.860]   to protect the brain against acute stroke.
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:13.400]   Different pharmacologic agents were tried.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:19.640]   Probably a thousand different drugs were tried
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:25.200]   which blocked the pathway leading to cell death.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:29.160]   So interestingly, when you deprive the brain
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:31.340]   and the neurons of oxygen and glucose,
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:35.680]   they don't die immediately and it takes some time
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:37.880]   and it's actually an active process.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:42.880]   So the release of these excitatory amino acids occurs.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:47.760]   So normally, as you know, glutamate, aspartate
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.720]   are important neurotransmitters in the brain
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.900]   and you need them to function.
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:54.560]   But after a stroke, when there's a deprivation
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:57.340]   of oxygen and glucose and a mismatch
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:00.600]   between the metabolism and the supply
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:05.160]   of oxygen and glucose, for some reason there's a release
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:09.520]   of these excitatory amino acids like glutamate
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:14.460]   and that causes an influx of calcium into the neurons
[01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:17.320]   which is the final common pathway to dying.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:21.720]   And then there are other pathways that can then lead
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:26.720]   to release of free radicals which are more damaging
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.960]   and those can cause another type of cell death
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.520]   called apoptotic cell death.
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:35.520]   That's a cell death that occurs and requires protein synthesis
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:41.000]   and then with reperfusion, say the artery opens up,
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.740]   then you got a lot of inflammation.
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:45.400]   So these pharmacological treatments, as I say,
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:49.000]   a thousand of them were tried and they were found
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.240]   to be very effective in preclinical stroke models.
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:55.420]   So we could cure stroke in the lab.
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:59.000]   My lab studied this for probably 15 years
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.560]   and there was no doubt we could cure stroke
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:05.640]   if we got the drugs on board even after the stroke
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:11.560]   within a few hours, but it never was able to be translated
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:15.340]   to the clinical arena except for one case.
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:17.920]   So besides drugs that were tried,
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:21.800]   another method of protecting the brain was tried
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:26.800]   called mild hypothermia and that was a process
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:31.700]   of reducing the brain temperature and body temperature
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:36.700]   just a few degrees from 37 degrees centigrade to 33.
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:39.900]   And we were one of the first to show
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:45.020]   that that was protective even after the stroke in animals.
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:48.220]   - My understanding is that when you cool neural tissue,
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:50.300]   you quiet its electrical activity.
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:54.140]   In fact, this is a common tool for experimentation
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:55.800]   in neuroscience laboratories.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:58.980]   You want to shut down a brain area transiently,
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:00.780]   you cool it down.
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:05.500]   - Right, and in fact, deep hypothermia has a profound effect
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.000]   on shutting down the metabolism.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.440]   So that's why when someone, particularly kids,
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:14.400]   fall into a frozen pond with ice cold water,
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:17.240]   they can survive there for half an hour
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.640]   and make a complete recovery because their body temperature
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.440]   is dropped down to very low, like 20 degrees centigrade.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.820]   But this is less, this is just a few degrees.
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:30.800]   So the amount, there is a slight decrease
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.480]   in the metabolic activity,
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:34.420]   but that does not account for all the protection.
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:38.900]   It's due to the fact that hypothermia, mild hypothermia,
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:41.360]   blocks many of those detrimental pathways.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:45.520]   It blocks partly the release of those excitatory amino acids,
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:48.360]   glutamate, it blocks the calcium influx,
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.180]   it blocks the inflammation.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:55.040]   And so that's probably why it works so well.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.440]   It even blocks that other pathway of programmed cell death
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.520]   because it hits all these pathways.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.200]   It's multifactorial, it's very effective.
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:09.200]   And in fact, it was finally shown in the early 2000s
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:14.360]   in prospective randomized studies that one type of stroke,
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.400]   actually two types, I should say,
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:19.760]   two types of stroke are benefited
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.200]   by cooling the brain quickly.
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:25.040]   One is cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:28.880]   and prospective studies which were published in 2002
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.560]   showed that if you cool patients who have cardiac arrest
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:35.840]   and then are resuscitated out in the field
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.600]   down to between 32 and 34 degrees centigrade from 37,
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:44.320]   much better outcomes neurologically.
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:45.920]   That's from global ischemia.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:49.120]   That's the no blood getting to the brain briefly.
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:50.920]   And the other area where it's been shown
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:55.580]   to have better outcomes is in neonatal,
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.560]   what's called hypostatic ischemic injury.
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.240]   Those are neonates who have lack of blood flow
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.340]   for some reason to the brain when they're born.
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:06.200]   And if you cool them, it's been shown in studies
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:08.820]   up to 10 years later
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:11.840]   that they have better cognitive outcomes.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.840]   So for cardiac arrest in the mid 2000s,
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:19.920]   I think it was 2003,
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:23.980]   the American Heart Association determined
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:26.560]   it was a standard of care, a guideline
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.560]   that you had to cool patients after cardiac arrest.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:31.400]   Yes.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:34.000]   - How was the cooling done in the experiments
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.500]   that you were involved in?
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.660]   - Yeah, so there are many ways to do it,
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:38.920]   but in the animal models,
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:42.000]   you can just cool them with a cooling blanket, actually.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000]   In people, we got very interested in this.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.320]   In fact, when I saw in the laboratory
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:51.240]   that it was so effective and that we could cure mouse
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:54.200]   and rat stroke by cooling,
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:58.400]   I started cooling my patients in the operating room
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:04.200]   because I felt, even if it hadn't been proven in patients,
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.480]   that it was so effective.
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.040]   It's the gold standard now, actually,
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:13.040]   for neuroprotection against stroke in the laboratory.
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:17.080]   So back in the 1990s,
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:20.140]   I started cooling all of my patients.
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:24.980]   We started by cooling them by packing them in ice
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:26.960]   and putting alcohol on them,
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:30.440]   but the operating room staff, appropriately,
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.880]   didn't like that 'cause alcohol's inflammable.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.800]   So then we started using cooling blankets,
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:38.320]   and then a number of companies
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:42.520]   started developing cooling catheters,
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.960]   and I worked with several of these.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:46.960]   So you can actually cool very quickly
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:51.960]   if you put a catheter into a vessel, say, in the groin,
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:57.720]   and infuse cold saline,
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:59.960]   which doesn't get into the circulation,
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:02.000]   but it cools the blood,
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.560]   and the cooled blood then circulates.
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:09.120]   Other ways of cooling are putting on special devices
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:10.440]   which cool quickly,
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:13.720]   and that's what's used now are external devices.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:16.780]   People are working on cooling just the head with helmets.
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:22.820]   So it's still an active field of investigation for stroke
[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.720]   and also for cardiac arrest, actually.
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:30.080]   It has not been proven in well-designed prospective trials
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:34.600]   that it works for garden-variety focal stroke.
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.080]   It works for cardiac arrest
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.760]   where there's global lack of blood flow to the brain,
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.160]   like when the heart stops.
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:44.360]   It hasn't been proven yet for the kind of stroke
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:45.240]   we've been talking about
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:48.040]   where there's a single-blocked artery to the brain.
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:48.880]   - So interesting.
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.220]   I mean, a lot of times on this podcast,
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:52.540]   we talk about the critical need for body temperature
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:55.520]   to drop by one to three degrees to get into deep sleep.
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:56.920]   We had Craig Heller,
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.440]   our colleague from the biology department at Stanford,
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:00.520]   on the podcast where he talked
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:01.960]   about some of the Palmer cooling,
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:05.360]   and essentially cooling the soles of the feet,
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:07.300]   the palms of the hands, and the upper part of the face
[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:10.260]   as a way to more rapidly reduce core body temperature.
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:14.280]   I think these are fascinating areas for exploration
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:18.860]   that obviously have clinical applications,
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:20.840]   but also you'd imagine for some of the things
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:21.940]   we were talking about before,
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:25.740]   like just to provide a bit of neuroprotection
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:28.640]   after a head hit or provide a bit of neuroprotection,
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:31.360]   perhaps even as it relates to aging,
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:34.460]   spending a little bit of time, maybe 10 minutes a day,
[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:37.840]   not badly hypothermic, please people,
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.240]   but slightly hypothermic,
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:41.200]   and then bringing the body temperature back up.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.720]   - Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't recommend
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:46.200]   if you have a head injury or a TIA
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:49.280]   to stick your head in a snowbank,
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:52.160]   but even with traumatic brain injury,
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.680]   severe, not just concussion,
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.960]   but severe TBI, traumatic brain injury,
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:59.920]   studies were done looking at cooling hypothermia,
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.560]   and it's called mild hypothermia
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:03.520]   'cause it's just a few degrees,
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:05.520]   and the studies were very suggestive,
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.800]   but didn't get to the point that it was proven,
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:12.960]   although certain subgroups who were cooled quickly
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.520]   seemed to do better.
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:17.960]   So I think it's a subject that's still being studied,
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:21.680]   and as I say, it's easy for us to do in the operating room.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:22.840]   You don't wanna cool too much
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:24.640]   'cause that can then interfere
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:29.440]   with other metabolic functions and clotting parameters,
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.560]   and it can cause increased infection
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:34.040]   if you go too low for too long,
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:39.040]   but I still let my patients cool just a few degrees,
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:42.520]   and we've had some anecdotal cases
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:46.560]   where patients have had problems,
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:50.800]   and because we cooled them, we think it made a benefit.
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.960]   For instance, we had one patient
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.120]   who we hadn't even done,
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.600]   I was getting ready to do a bypass
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:00.360]   to sew a scalp artery to a brain artery,
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:05.360]   but we hadn't even, I think, made the skin incision,
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:09.320]   and the patient had a cardiac arrest,
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:15.280]   and it lasted for a long time,
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:19.360]   so we were pumping on the chest, couldn't restore function,
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:23.760]   and it was way outside the amount of time
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.480]   that you would have expected a good recovery,
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:29.000]   but the patient had been cooled down to 33 degrees
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.840]   before we, by the time it had happened,
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:35.360]   and then we finally got the heart started.
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:36.960]   We ended up putting some,
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:40.760]   restoring flow through catheters and a heart-lung machine,
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:43.400]   and remarkably, the guy made a complete recovery.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:47.760]   So anecdotal, but cases like that
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:51.860]   suggest maybe cooling even a few degrees
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:54.200]   has a protective effect on the brain.
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.000]   We certainly know it's true
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.280]   for cardiac arrest and global ischemia.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:02.520]   - What are your thoughts on platelet-rich plasma, PRP?
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.240]   These days, we hear so much about PRP,
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:07.080]   I think it's FDA-approved for certain things, right?
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.480]   People will get blood drawn,
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.680]   they'll spin down platelets,
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:14.500]   and then put in platelet-rich plasma.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.320]   A few years ago, people were making claims out there
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.520]   about PRP containing stem cells.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:22.760]   Just for the record, my understanding,
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.880]   I'm sure someone will argue with me online, they always do,
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:29.000]   but my understanding is that PRP contains very few,
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.720]   if any, stem cells,
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.480]   and that it's not legal to assert
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:35.500]   that PRP is stem cell therapy,
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:38.060]   but PRP seems to be something that,
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.840]   after an injury or in anticipation of a surgery,
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:42.280]   people are starting to do more and more
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:45.080]   because they can go drop a few thousand dollars,
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:47.800]   and, I don't know, get this infusion of PRP.
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:51.200]   Does it work to help recover brain tissue
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:52.320]   or preserve brain tissue?
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.080]   Is there any evidence of that whatsoever?
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:57.080]   - I'm not an expert on platelet-rich plasma,
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:03.680]   but my reading of the literature
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:08.160]   cursorily suggests there's not hard evidence
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:10.080]   that it's beneficial.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.680]   I think one has to be a little careful.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:16.400]   For instance, I still get emails
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:20.440]   every few weeks from people saying,
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:24.020]   I've had a stroke or I've had a head injury,
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:29.020]   and should I go to Russia or India or Mexico
[01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:33.360]   and get stem cell therapy?
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.880]   - Yeah, this is a big topic area, yeah.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:38.040]   - And you may have discussed it on another podcast.
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:38.880]   - I have not.
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:40.520]   I'll do a solo episode on stem cells
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:41.960]   and what they are and what they aren't.
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:44.280]   I just will, just, sorry to interrupt,
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:46.960]   but I'm aware of a clinic in Florida
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:49.420]   that was injecting stem cells into the eyes of patients
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:52.000]   with macular degeneration and some other eye issues,
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.960]   and those patients rapidly went blind.
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:54.800]   - Yeah, I was going to bring that up too.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.120]   - Yeah, and that's what led the FDA
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:58.840]   to really clamp down on stem cell clinics in the U.S.
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:00.080]   - Although they haven't clamped down
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.160]   on those type clinics as well as they should.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:07.160]   But I tell patients, no, if you go out of the country,
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.240]   often you don't know what you're getting.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:11.680]   If there's not an equivalent of an FDA,
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:12.940]   which is overseeing it,
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:16.440]   you don't know whether these cell,
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.140]   where they come from sometimes.
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:19.840]   They're not published literature.
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:22.880]   You don't know where they're derived.
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:25.520]   We've seen cases of patients going elsewhere,
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:28.160]   getting injections into the brain or the spinal cord
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:30.680]   and developing tumors or other problems.
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:33.440]   So I discourage that, and I was going to bring up,
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:37.000]   even in this country, these clinics,
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.060]   and that was published a number of years ago,
[01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:41.560]   that clinic in Florida.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:45.960]   Those patients had macular degeneration
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.280]   and they were losing their sight,
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.800]   but they could still see to some extent.
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:53.640]   They had their own adipose tissue taken.
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:57.800]   They sorted it for certain stem cells,
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:59.200]   mesenchymal stem cells,
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.840]   and it was re-injected into the eye.
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:02.840]   Should have been safe, right?
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:04.320]   Their own cells even.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:07.200]   And as you say, several of them went blind.
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:08.360]   Irreversibly.
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:09.280]   Irreversibly.
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:12.080]   So I think this is very important
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:15.940]   to highlight the dangers of stem cell therapy in general.
[01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:17.400]   There's a lot of hope for it.
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.320]   I mean, we're engaged.
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.360]   We're just finishing a trial,
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:22.840]   a first in human trial at Stanford
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:25.480]   using cells we developed in my lab 20 years ago.
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:28.680]   It took us 20 years to prove that they were safe,
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:31.200]   effective, didn't cause tumors.
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:33.620]   And the study is looking very promising.
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:34.800]   It's a phase one study
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.060]   and we're making plans to do a phase two study
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:41.400]   with control patients, which you always want to do.
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:46.400]   But despite the hope, there is still a lot of hype.
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:49.800]   And I think it's very important to be careful
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:52.880]   about getting therapies that are not proven.
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:55.080]   - Yeah, and while we wouldn't want anyone
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:58.060]   to take any kind of unnecessary risk,
[01:38:58.060 --> 01:38:59.320]   you know, to me anyway,
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:01.920]   this goes back to the beginning of our conversation,
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:03.840]   that there's something very different about a knee
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.200]   from the brain, right?
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:07.660]   I'm not saying go get stem cells injected into your knee,
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:10.960]   but should you be the sort of person that wants to do that
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.880]   because you feel that's within your rights?
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.440]   You know, again, I don't tell people what to do.
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:17.500]   And you go to a clinic, they get stem cells,
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:20.600]   or I don't know, they take stem cells from some source
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:21.640]   and put them into your knee.
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:24.440]   I mean, that's a very different situation
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:26.840]   than injecting into the brain or spinal cord.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:30.320]   - Some of the approaches to treat diseases of the brain
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:33.240]   or injuries to the brain are not injecting directly
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:34.080]   into the brain.
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:37.680]   They're injecting intravenously or intra-arterial,
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:39.440]   threading a catheter up, as we discussed,
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.740]   and injecting in the brain.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:45.400]   Those cells, it turns out, don't even get into the brain.
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:49.040]   And the idea is that in some of the better studies
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.160]   that have been done in animals,
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:55.420]   that they work by modulating the immune system systemically.
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:59.060]   Those cells get trapped in the lung and the spleen,
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:02.280]   which people describe as bioreactors,
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:03.920]   and modulate the immune system,
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.360]   which does make some sense.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:08.760]   As I say, we think one of the main benefits
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:13.680]   of these stem cells is that they modulate the immune system,
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:16.000]   and that helps with plasticity in the brain.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000]   But even intravenous delivery can be dangerous to the brain.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.880]   - Yeah, this is an area that we will spend a lot more time
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:27.300]   on during this podcast.
[01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:30.560]   But despite what you just said,
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:33.200]   I think the data I've seen from your laboratory,
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:36.200]   and as you told me, there's a trial that's finishing up now
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:39.240]   that features those data,
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:42.520]   or that is where those data arrive from, rather,
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:43.640]   are really impressive.
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:48.080]   I mean, some people who were largely immobile or aphasic,
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:49.760]   they couldn't speak,
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:52.280]   in some cases are able to speak or move.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:53.360]   And that's really remarkable.
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:54.180]   It's really exciting.
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:56.240]   So I think that the future of stem cells
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:00.760]   and stroke therapy is pretty bright,
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:02.320]   at least from where I sit.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.880]   - Yeah, we don't want to oversell this,
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:09.720]   but some of the results in certain patients are remarkable.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:12.280]   I mean, the patients and their families
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:13.840]   say it's changed their lives.
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.560]   If you see them before and after,
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.280]   it's almost like a miracle.
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.960]   Others are not as impressive,
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.820]   but so far in our trial,
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:27.320]   and we've treated 17 of the 18 intended patients,
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:32.280]   almost all the patients have recovered to some extent,
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:37.280]   and many of them have improved in a meaningful way
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.000]   if you use certain scales.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.440]   So again, we want to be cautious.
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:43.920]   We're going to do a prospective randomized
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:45.920]   blinded controlled study,
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:47.840]   and that's the way it should be done.
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:50.040]   And if that's positive,
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:55.040]   it would lead to a phase three larger study,
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:57.640]   again, blinded controlled.
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:58.920]   And if that's positive,
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:02.880]   then it would lead to commercialization, FDA approval.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.440]   It's a long process.
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.000]   I've spent 23 years
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000]   and more than $46 million in grants and philanthropy
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.200]   getting it to this stage.
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.400]   - Wow. - Yeah.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.760]   - Wow.
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:21.780]   That's a lot of time and a lot of money.
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:22.880]   Amazing.
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:24.160]   - That's the way science
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:27.200]   and translation to clinical medicine is.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:31.040]   - I would be remiss if I didn't ask,
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:32.240]   what are some of the things
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:34.280]   that you think could accelerate that process,
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:36.320]   or is that just the slow iterative process
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:37.400]   that is science and medicine?
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.460]   I mean, for instance,
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:41.640]   if there was five times as much money,
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:44.900]   would the science progress at five times the rate?
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:46.280]   Probably not.
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.840]   - No, but money is a factor.
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:50.800]   It's not the only factor.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:55.800]   The FDA is appropriately very cautious.
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:57.960]   I think other countries,
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:59.920]   the equivalent of the FDA
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:01.440]   moves things along a little quicker,
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:04.960]   especially for therapies where there's no other treatment.
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:11.400]   So I think those factors are important
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:12.920]   and would accelerate it.
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:15.580]   I think greater collaboration with industry
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:17.840]   and promoting more academic industry
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:20.880]   kinds of relationships would help
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:25.520]   because the government agencies
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:29.680]   do not provide enough money to do the final stage.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:32.400]   You know, there's called this valley of death
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:37.400]   where you get initial encouraging data, even clinically,
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:42.280]   but you can't move the hurdle to get it into FDA approval
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:46.900]   because of money in some cases.
[01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:49.080]   I've seen, as an example,
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:52.420]   a number of very good stem cell therapies
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:56.100]   not make it because the companies went bankrupt.
[01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:58.820]   The board of directors of the company felt
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:00.620]   the results were good, but not good enough,
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:02.660]   and they pulled the funding.
[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:07.540]   So this is a whole area which I was not well informed of
[01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:12.100]   until I got into this of how you move through the FDA
[01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:15.760]   and how you work with industry.
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:20.580]   I haven't formed a company yet, but I'm gonna have to
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:22.060]   because for the next trial,
[01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:24.940]   this trial I was fortunate to get a grant
[01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:27.660]   from CIRM, California Institute for Regenerative Medicine,
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:28.500]   of $12 million.
[01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:30.040]   - So that's taxpayer dollars.
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:30.880]   - Exactly.
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:31.820]   - Great use of taxpayer money,
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:34.440]   putting it to really forward-thinking research.
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:38.460]   - But the next trial, and our results are good enough
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:40.260]   that we probably will only need,
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:44.540]   if we do a statistical power analysis, 69 patients.
[01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:47.060]   Initially, we thought we'd need 170 patients,
[01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:49.300]   but the results keep getting better and better.
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:54.300]   So now, it seems we would only need about 69 patients.
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:59.520]   That will cost at least 45 million,
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:03.180]   and as the trials get larger, even more.
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:06.280]   So yeah, we need to figure out a better way
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:09.980]   to allocate money to make these advances.
[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:13.020]   - It sounds like a company or some role of industry
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:14.980]   is going to be necessary.
[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:17.380]   - Well, you might be interested in investing, right?
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:22.460]   - Well, this podcast is always available free
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:23.860]   at a standard Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:27.340]   Our premium channel actually generates money.
[01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:29.560]   We do Ask Me Anythings and things of that sort.
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:31.400]   We have donors that have come in for a dollar match,
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:33.340]   and we do philanthropy to laboratories
[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:35.820]   at Stanford, Salk Institute, Columbia University.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:36.660]   We've already done that.
[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:37.860]   We're gonna do more of this.
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:39.540]   - Well, I was being facetious.
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:41.280]   - Oh, no, listen, we could explore it.
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:44.200]   One of the guidelines is that we fund research
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:48.420]   on humans exclusively, so we could talk about that.
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:51.900]   The former colleague of ours at Stanford
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:54.620]   once told me the joke.
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:56.420]   We'll see if I get in trouble for this joke,
[01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:58.740]   which is that there are two kinds of Stanford faculty,
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:00.220]   Stanford faculty with companies
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:02.740]   and Stanford faculty with successful companies.
[01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:05.960]   So we'll see what comes down the pike from that.
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:09.100]   But I mean, many of the technologies and discoveries
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:12.020]   that have been made at Stanford have spun off into,
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:14.500]   there are these little companies like Genentech
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:16.060]   and other companies like that
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:18.660]   that are not strictly Stanford relations,
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:20.300]   but of course other universities too.
[01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:22.780]   But universities are where the basic research is done,
[01:46:22.780 --> 01:46:24.580]   and then somebody has to implement those.
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:25.700]   - Stanford's getting much better.
[01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:28.340]   When I came to Stanford in 1974,
[01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:34.300]   the medical center was more like an NIH of the West,
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:37.300]   and there was not a lot of clinical excellence
[01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:40.700]   except for cardiac surgery, Norm Shumway,
[01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:44.380]   and radiation oncology, Henry Kaplan,
[01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:47.580]   who had developed the first radiation method
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:48.700]   for treating lymphoma.
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:53.020]   And we were great at making basic discoveries,
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:55.400]   not very good at translating them,
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:59.340]   but over the last, what, 50 years,
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:03.440]   Stanford has gotten much better at translating them
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:08.060]   into clinical therapies,
[01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:10.340]   and even doing some of that work at Stanford,
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:12.360]   not farming it out to other places.
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:16.100]   So I think that's another area that we need to encourage.
[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:18.340]   - Well, the proximity to big tech
[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:24.740]   is sort of built into the fabric of the Bay Area now.
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:26.300]   There's just no escaping that.
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:30.380]   And I think overall, it's not without its sometimes issues,
[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:32.440]   but overall, I think it's a really good thing,
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:35.460]   facilitates the most rapid possible flow
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:37.340]   between basic science discovery
[01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:40.460]   and implementation at large.
[01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:43.140]   I want to make sure that we cover
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:45.460]   just a little bit about vagal stimulation.
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:46.860]   A lot of listeners to this podcast
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:48.100]   are familiar with the vagus nerve
[01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:49.460]   as this very extensive pathway
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:51.660]   connecting brain and body in both directions.
[01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:55.780]   The common idea out there
[01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:58.780]   is that the vagus is associated with calming
[01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:00.580]   because it's in the parasympathetic arm
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:01.820]   or the autonomic nervous system,
[01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:03.360]   the so-called rest and digest pathway.
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:04.660]   But I happen to know,
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:06.620]   and I'm sure you know from experimentation
[01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:08.380]   and from clinical work,
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:10.020]   that oftentimes vagal stimulation
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.840]   is a way of bringing, say, depressed patients
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:13.180]   up to more alertness.
[01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:16.060]   That vagal stimulation is not always about calming.
[01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:18.700]   It can be about alerting the brain
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:20.980]   or making the brain more alert.
[01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:24.300]   So what sorts of vagal stimulation are you doing?
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:29.300]   Given that the vagal pathway is so extensive,
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:31.580]   like which branch of the vagus do you stimulate?
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:32.900]   There's, it goes around the ear.
[01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:33.740]   It's in the neck.
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:34.580]   It goes down through the gut.
[01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:37.620]   I mean, we're talking basically about a superhighway of,
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:39.820]   I mean, it kind of reminds me of the Austin freeway system.
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:40.940]   If you've ever driven in Austin,
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:43.540]   it's like the freeways go in every which direction.
[01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:44.380]   And so whenever I'm there,
[01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:46.140]   I'm like the freeway system here is kind of like the vagus.
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:48.980]   So which avenue do you stimulate
[01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:50.800]   in order to get a desired effect?
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:52.340]   - Right, well, for stroke,
[01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:54.820]   and as I alluded to,
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:58.060]   vagal nerve stimulation coupled with physical therapy,
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:00.620]   physical activity, very intensive,
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:04.180]   was the very first FDA approved treatment
[01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:05.740]   for chronic stroke patients.
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:10.220]   That was approved in 2021, three years ago.
[01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:12.380]   And it was shown in the study
[01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:16.620]   that compared with non-stimulation,
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:18.340]   in other words, putting the stimulator on,
[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:22.060]   but not stimulating and doing the therapy,
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:23.900]   that patients did better.
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:28.900]   It was a modest improvement, but it felt to be meaningful.
[01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:32.380]   And it was shown to be effective at 90 days,
[01:49:32.380 --> 01:49:33.540]   only three months.
[01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:39.540]   Now, recently at the last international stroke meeting,
[01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:42.980]   this past February, it was presented,
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:45.020]   and I don't know if it's been published yet,
[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:49.920]   that those results hold up for up to a year.
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:53.580]   So the way it works, presumably,
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:56.460]   is that you stimulate the entire vagus nerve in the neck.
[01:49:57.460 --> 01:50:00.500]   And it's not the peripheral effects on the heart
[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:04.620]   or the other autonomic organs where it's working,
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:09.260]   it's stimulation that goes back to the brain, right?
[01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:10.780]   'Cause when you stimulate a nerve,
[01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:13.260]   it doesn't go in one direction.
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.660]   And that's probably how it works for depression also,
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:17.340]   not a systemic, but,
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:19.700]   and the vagus has lots of connection
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:21.500]   with brain functions, right?
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:25.940]   And so that's, it's not completely clear
[01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:28.060]   which areas are being stimulated
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:31.900]   to recover from stroke or improve depression,
[01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:35.540]   but it's brain stimulation that somehow,
[01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:37.940]   again, resurrects circuits
[01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:40.460]   or induces plasticity in circuits.
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:46.100]   Again, it's something that we're learning about.
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:49.060]   And I think not just vagal nerve stimulation,
[01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:52.660]   but stimulation of the brain is becoming
[01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:56.100]   a very important innovative treatment
[01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:59.020]   for many brain diseases and injuries.
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:01.180]   - Is the vagal stimulation,
[01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:04.900]   is it invasive or can you use an external stimulator?
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:06.100]   - It's invasive.
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:07.700]   You have to do an operation.
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:11.080]   It's low risk, very few side effects.
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:12.700]   Occasionally there are some,
[01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:15.460]   it can cause some problems with swallowing,
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:18.020]   which are usually temporary, right?
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:19.260]   'Cause the vagal nerve,
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:23.380]   the recurrent vagal nerve supplies the larynx,
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:24.260]   the vocal cord.
[01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:29.300]   But, so it's an implanted stimulator,
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:31.740]   but the stimulation can be turned on and off
[01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:35.640]   with an external magnet device.
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:36.500]   - Incredible.
[01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:39.500]   Gary, Dr. Steinberg,
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.960]   I want to thank you for several things.
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:46.040]   First of all, for coming here today to share with us,
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:48.480]   right up until the point we hit hot mics,
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:50.540]   meaning we started recording,
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:52.100]   you were getting calls about patients.
[01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:53.720]   I know you're still in the operating room.
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:57.140]   You were our department chair for more than two decades.
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:51:57.980]   - 25.
[01:51:57.980 --> 01:51:59.700]   - 25 years, thank you for that.
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:04.100]   And, you know, still just so active in this area
[01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:06.420]   doing cutting edge research and stem cells
[01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:07.860]   and so much more.
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:09.420]   So as an extremely busy person
[01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:11.140]   who has many important duties,
[01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:13.600]   you are literally a brain surgeon,
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:15.180]   to take the time out of your schedule
[01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:17.940]   to come here and share with us all this information
[01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:20.060]   about how to keep our brain healthy,
[01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:22.540]   the relationship between alcohol and nicotine.
[01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:24.140]   Fortunately, caffeine's not on the list,
[01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:25.820]   but don't overdo it, folks.
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:28.540]   Neuroprotection, the discussion about TBI,
[01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:31.740]   something we've never discussed on this podcast,
[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:33.580]   transient ischemic attacks,
[01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:37.340]   and just a really vast survey of things
[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:39.140]   that concern a lot of people,
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:43.040]   and that also now having heard what you've shared,
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:46.860]   also puts them in a position now to empower themselves,
[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:48.820]   to take some agency over their brain health,
[01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:51.660]   which is something that I think most people really fear,
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:53.500]   that this thing inside our skulls
[01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:55.180]   is outside the reach of our efforts
[01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:56.340]   to try and maintain health.
[01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:59.320]   And clearly you've explained how that is not the case,
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:01.500]   and there are things we can do to both protect ourselves
[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:03.480]   and to overcome challenges should they arise.
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:06.860]   So on behalf of myself and all the listeners and viewers,
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:08.420]   I just want to say thank you so much,
[01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:12.740]   and hopefully as these trials continue to develop,
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:14.980]   you'll come back and update us on the progress.
[01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:16.380]   - Andrew, it's been a real pleasure.
[01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:17.980]   Thank you for inviting me.

[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:06.420]   So that's Instagram, X, LinkedIn, threads, and Facebook.
[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:07.860]   And on all those platforms,
[01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:09.940]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:11.420]   some of which overlap with the content
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:12.640]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:14.820]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:16.060]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:19.400]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.

[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:29.400]   in the form of brief PDFs of one to three pages
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:31.260]   that are protocols that describe things
[01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:33.620]   like how to best do deliberate cold exposure,
[01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:34.580]   deliberate heat exposure.
[01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:36.740]   We have a foundational fitness protocol,
[01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:38.720]   a neuroplasticity and learning protocol,
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:41.740]   ways to optimize your sleep, dopamine, and much more.
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:43.100]   All available at zero cost.

[01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:57.380]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:59.420]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:02.000]   [upbeat music]
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.580]   (upbeat music)
