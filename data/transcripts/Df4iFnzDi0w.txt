[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   Okay, folks, we're going to get started.
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.780]   I'm going to cut the introduction short.
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.440]   The moderator for this Q&A with the experts session
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.940]   is my good friend and Bogohed's conference team member, Mel
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.440]   Turner.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.400]   Please welcome Mel.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.880]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.840]   Thank you.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.480]   Before we start, if I could have everybody just wave.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.600]   We're trying to stay in touch with Paul down in San Diego.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.960]   We're texting back and forth.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.160]   So if I could have everybody wave, I'm going to take a picture of you real quick.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.680]   And I'll send it to him.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.360]   So OK, that's good.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.000]   Perfect.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.520]   Perfect.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.480]   Real quick like that.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.000]   He'll appreciate it, I'll tell you.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.400]   He's like hanging on the edge of his seat.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.400]   So my name is Mel Turner, better known as Tom.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.200]   You know the story behind that, so I won't get into that.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.440]   Thanks for all the first timers that have come here.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.940]   We appreciate you making the effort.
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.560]   And also for the people that are coming back, welcome back.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.720]   We hope you enjoy it.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.760]   I also need to recognize my wife.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.080]   This year is our 50th year of marriage.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.800]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.440]   I'm not sure how she puts up with it, actually,
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.040]   this insanity that I go through.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.440]   So who are we?
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.400]   We represent, inside the room, 31 states.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.720]   We have three countries until Nicaragua had to back out.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.120]   Mary flew all the way from Germany.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.640]   She's by far the farthest.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.560]   And she came out here just for the conference.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.320]   That's pretty amazing to me.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.880]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.440]   About a third of you are the first timers,
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.280]   and 2/3 of you have been here before.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.600]   And that stays true almost every year, year after year.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.300]   So we're glad to have the new people that
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.760]   are in here all the time.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.720]   I've collected the questions.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.160]   I've got about 20 pages of single spaced questions.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.880]   I've tried to sort them out, made some for the young people,
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.680]   for the old people, for the beginners,
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.320]   the novice investors, and also for some more experts.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.360]   So I try to spread them out as best I can.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.240]   I've changed the wording on a lot of them.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.720]   I've amended them.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.560]   But I'm sure you'll recognize your question.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.400]   I've tried to give priority to everybody that's in this room.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.680]   So your questions are going to be asked first,
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.360]   or at least your name will be mentioned first.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.320]   So the goal is to finish up about 10 minutes early.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.400]   Mel said he'd give me a heads up.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.520]   And then we're going to allow each panelist
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.400]   to have the last two minutes each
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.200]   and just tell what they're doing, what their goals are,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.800]   last minute thoughts, nuggets that they've saved.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.920]   Oh, I wanted to say that.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.640]   That's going to be their chance to be able to say that.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.440]   So this session is all about you, is your questions.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.040]   And we're here to listen to what the panelists have to say.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.520]   So I'd like to go to the introductions
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.400]   in alphabetical order.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.640]   Last year, I said in alphabetical order.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.760]   And I introduced Bill Bernstein first.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.640]   And I saw body language of Christine Bens saying,
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.520]   wait a minute, Bill Bernstein, what's up with that?
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.520]   And I just realized after I got home, oh, I messed up.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.320]   So we're actually going to do it in alphabetical order today.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.200]   So our first panelist is a Morningstar director
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   of personal finance and the senior columnist
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.960]   for Morningstar.com.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.040]   She's a prolific financial writer and, in my opinion,
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.560]   one of the best financial interviewers that's around.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.080]   Please welcome Christine Bens.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.440]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.040]   Our next panelist is co-founder of Efficient Frontier Advisors
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.960]   and author of several successful titles
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.160]   on finance and economic history.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.120]   His book, Four Pillars of Investment,
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.880]   I consider to be a classic.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.960]   But he's also written books about the history of trade
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.160]   and the influence of the media.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.000]   He has a PhD in chemistry.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.400]   And he's also an MD.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.440]   He practiced neurology until he retired.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.520]   And then he went over to something real simple,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.800]   like investing.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.440]   And I wish I had half of his eloquence.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.880]   So please welcome a Boglehead favorite, Dr. Bill Bernstein.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.320]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.760]   This is a second visit for our next panelist.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.400]   And he's a Boglehead favorite.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.200]   After 20 years of writing columns in the Wall Street
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.520]   Journal, he's also written nine books,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.680]   including his most recent, From Here to Financial Happiness,
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.680]   which was released in September.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.240]   And he, just on a personal note, inspired me.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.360]   Back in the late '90s, I collected
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.080]   every one of his getting going columns.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.760]   And I have a three-ring binder at home
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.080]   that I still save to this day.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.960]   So please welcome Jonathan Clements.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.400]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.800]   Our next panelist is the founder of Portfolio Solutions
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.240]   and the author of several investment books,
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.360]   including The Power of Passive Investing,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.080]   all about index funds, the ETF book,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.600]   and all about asset allocation.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.000]   He's been a supporter of the Bogleheads
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.360]   right from the beginning.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.400]   And we are fortunate to, once again, have him on the panel.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.920]   He also does a Boglehead podcast.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.080]   And you can find his new website just
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.760]   by typing in Rick Ferry at Core 4, and it'll pop right up.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.660]   So welcome my fellow marine aviator, Rick Ferry.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.120]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.000]   Our next panelist is the founder of WealthLogic.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.600]   He holds a CPA, CFP, and an MBA.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.600]   And he served as a corporate finance officer
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.320]   of two multibillion-dollar companies.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.600]   He has decades of research in portfolio construction,
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.400]   but does his best to keep investing
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.920]   simple for his clients.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.920]   I personally recommend his How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.360]   I loaned the book to my friend, who had a broker with UBS,
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.960]   and he wouldn't give it back to me.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.620]   And I said, hey, Bob, give me this book back.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.200]   I can't do it.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.460]   I said, why are you keeping it?
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.640]   He says, I'm moving everything from UBS over to Vanguard,
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.680]   just because of the book.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.360]   So I--
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.320]   Checks in the mail, thank you.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.920]   So if I had to do battle with Wall Street Financial Machine,
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.480]   I want him on my side.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.480]   His professional goal is to never
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.320]   be confused with Jim Cramer.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.880]   Please welcome Alan Roth.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.840]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.000]   Our next panelist is here for the first time,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.080]   became a personal finance columnist of The Wall Street
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.160]   Journal in 2008, and continues to write a weekly column,
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.920]   The Intelligent Investor.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.880]   Before that, he wrote columns in Money, Time, Forbes Magazine,
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.240]   has written several books.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.840]   My favorite is Your Money, Your Brain.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.680]   And he was the editor of the revised edition
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.680]   of Benjamin Graham's Intelligent Investor.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.360]   This is his first visit to the Volkland Conference,
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.840]   and we hope it won't be his last.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.320]   Please welcome Jason Zweig.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.680]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.360]   So the first question--
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.040]   if Tater was on there, I always ask him the first question.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.920]   And to honor Tater Larimore, for those who don't know,
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.880]   he was one of the founders of our Boglehead group.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.000]   Back in April, I emailed him and said,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.840]   Tater, I want you to have the first question.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.360]   What do you want it to be about?
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.120]   We went back and forth several times
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.200]   about what subject we're bringing out.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.240]   And as you know, he's a man of few words,
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.160]   but he's succinct, and he gets right to the point.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.600]   I told him about my story of messing up.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.160]   28, went to a personal finance class with my wife.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.480]   Out of that, you got a free one hour with a CFP.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.960]   And we were lambs to the slaughter,
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.040]   walked out of there with a whole life life insurance policy,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.280]   a limited partnership that confused my taxes for decades.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.000]   And he sold me Oppenheimer Regency Fund
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.040]   with an 8 and 1/2% load before I knew what load was.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.720]   So Tater decided, you know, everybody
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.840]   thinks these experts never make any mistakes.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.200]   So he says, why don't you pass this on?
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.360]   Says, what was your biggest mistake
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.880]   of each one of the panelists, and what did you learn from it?
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.880]   Anybody can go first on this one.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.080]   I'll go first.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.640]   Back when I was the mutual funds editor at Forbes--
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.960]   this would date back to 1992.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.120]   Jonathan had the job before me.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:28.880]   I thought about how I should work the match in my 401(k).
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.800]   And believe it or not, I've learned a lot in 26 years.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.080]   Believe it or not, I said to myself,
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.440]   I don't want to contribute up to the max
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.320]   because I can do better with my own money
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.800]   than these guys at the firm that managed our 401(k)
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.280]   at the time, which wasn't Vanguard, by the way.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.800]   And so I didn't contribute up to the match, up to the max.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.920]   And about 10 years ago, I calculated
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.760]   what my opportunity cost was of relying on my own brilliance.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.800]   And 10 years ago, it was about $280,000.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.400]   So go for the match and the max.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.480]   I'm competitive.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.400]   I'm going to beat you, Jason.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.640]   I took my college graduation money in 1980
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:32.040]   and put $6,684 into 10 gold coins when gold was surging
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.040]   because I was sure it was going to triple.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.880]   Today, it's not quite double that,
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.160]   meaning that it hasn't kept up with inflation.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.240]   I did the math.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:50.640]   Had I instead invested in Jack Bogle's S&P 500 Index Fund,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.840]   I'd have well over $400,000 more.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840]   All righty.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.080]   Well, I have invested in Palladium Futures,
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:09.000]   chased mutual fund, active mutual fund performance.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.800]   Wasn't smart enough to buy a house in Los Angeles
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   when we moved there in 1976.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.640]   But by far, by far, the biggest mistake
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.200]   that I would made, which probably runs to seven figures,
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.520]   was not understanding that the optimal strategy for someone
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.160]   who is deep early into their saving years
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.600]   is to simply put 100% into equity every single month,
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.160]   every single year.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.320]   And that really is probably the biggest mistake,
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.400]   dollar sign-wise, that I made, of all the dozens of mistakes,
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.920]   smaller mistakes that I've made.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.680]   OK, I'll go.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.520]   Would you like to go?
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.020]   OK.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.200]   OK, go ahead.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.920]   So before I admit to my mistake, you
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.320]   should just notice the way the panel is set up,
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.960]   what they decided to do was to make sure
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.160]   that Rick and Alan were the two extremes.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.520]   So it's less likely to come to fisticuffs.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.360]   No.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.680]   But if it does, one, I'm in the wrong place.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.360]   And two, I'd bet on the Marine.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.840]   You're safer on this end of the table than that.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.760]   Unless you attack first.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.000]   I was a Cub Scout.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.560]   At least you had adult supervision.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.240]   So during the course of my adult years,
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.520]   I've managed to lose half of my wealth
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:40.640]   three times in the bear market that started in March 2000,
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.440]   the bear market that started in October 2007,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.480]   and when my wife left me.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.520]   And I've learned exactly nothing from all of those experiences.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.560]   I am still invested in the stock market,
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.200]   and I recently got remarried.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.520]   The triumph of hope over experience.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.240]   So I'll talk about three mistakes
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.880]   that I made in my 20s, because I can't
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.500]   decide which one was the worst.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.360]   So I bought fake Dolly prints in my 20s.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.240]   I bought a-- first stock I ever bought
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.040]   was an artificial intelligence stock.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.160]   It was highly recommended by Money magazine.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.080]   It went to zero in about six months.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.920]   And the third thing I bought as an investment was a timeshare.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.240]   And those were my three big mistakes.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.560]   I'll go ahead.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.000]   I have a long list, but I think the one that I reflect most on
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.280]   and feel the worst about is actually
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.840]   one that didn't have such a big effect on me personally,
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.960]   but I still feel guilty and complicit about having covered
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.320]   a lot of growth-oriented mutual funds
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.440]   when I was an analyst in the late '90s,
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.920]   and just not pushing back hard enough on that whole phenomenon
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.440]   and not pushing back on fund managers enough
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.840]   and not asking all of my stupid questions for fear
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:11.200]   that I would somehow show myself to be not so knowledgeable.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.240]   So I guess I've been trying to atone for that in one way
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.480]   or another ever since, because I feel
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.600]   guilty about whatever role I had in helping investors
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.640]   take part in that mania.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.480]   So I hope you don't feel so bad now about your mistakes.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.960]   We all make them.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.360]   If you don't make mistakes, you're not trying very hard.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.120]   So the next question is kind of a carryover
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.760]   from the last conference we had.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.080]   Sue asked a question about Bitcoin.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.680]   And everybody was getting a big laugh out of it,
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.400]   because they said, well, it's going to be the last one holding
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.640]   the bag is going to get stuck with a Bitcoin.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.280]   One of our panelists picked up the mic and said,
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.160]   I bought some Bitcoin.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.000]   There were so many people that inhaled it,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   sucked the air out of the room.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.520]   In the meantime, Bitcoin has been from 4,200 up to over 19,000,
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.480]   as you saw on Jack's slide today.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.480]   Right now, I don't follow, but it's like 6,200 or something
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.000]   like that.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   So we'd like to ask Alan Roth what
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.760]   you've learned in the last year, who's buying Bitcoin,
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.920]   and then we'd like to ask the panel as a whole,
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.720]   do you think it's a real deal or do you think it's a scam?
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.480]   For the record, I think I also disclosed about $200
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:33.160]   worth of Bitcoin, so that I could basically fact check
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.280]   everything people were telling me about buying Bitcoin,
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.600]   so that the article was accurate.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:46.000]   With that said, and I'm up by 50% still, but again,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.680]   I don't even know if I could have sold it
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.760]   when it hit $19,000.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.440]   It's probably going to be worth zero in 10 years,
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.520]   but with that said, it does solve the problem.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.720]   When I buy something on Amazon and get 2% cash back
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:09.120]   on my credit card, Amazon is being charged more than 2%
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.960]   on that.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.320]   Bitcoin makes the transaction virtually free,
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.960]   or maybe a dime.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.640]   So I'm not convinced.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.280]   It's likely to be worth zero.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.400]   There are thousands of different cryptocurrencies.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.160]   I'm thinking of creating RothCoin.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.160]   Raise your hand if you want to buy it.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.120]   Can you show us your coin after the conference?
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.120]   I want to see what it looks like.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.760]   It's virtual.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.160]   And it seems like they're always being investigated,
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.680]   or challenged, or something.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.560]   My gardener, I ask him if he's saving.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.480]   He says, I'm investing in Bitcoin.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.200]   That scared the daylights out of me.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.440]   But Bill, I'd like to know your opinion.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.680]   What's the deal in Bitcoin?
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.120]   You study the financial markets and that part
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.280]   of the academic part of it.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.800]   Well, I think that the academicians have been trying,
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.520]   probably since the time of De La Vega,
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.400]   to mathematically define what a bubble looks like.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.000]   And you can't do it.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.840]   Some very smart people have tried to do it.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.920]   And you can't define it mathematically.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.160]   But you can define it sociologically.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:20.880]   So it's when you see that it's topic A at social gatherings,
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.960]   check.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.400]   People quit good jobs, quit doing brain surgery
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.680]   to become crypto coin investors, check.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.520]   When you get pushback of an extreme sort,
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.200]   when you express skepticism.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.920]   I can't keep out of my mind the image
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.480]   of what John McAfee promised to do on national television.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.760]   If Bitcoin didn't reach a half a million dollars,
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.480]   you can look it up on-- you can Google it.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.040]   And then finally, when you see extreme predictions.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.520]   So it checks all of those boxes.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.240]   And so, yeah, I mean, it's just-- it'll
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.360]   be one more item in the history of bubbles
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.360]   that gets written every 10 or 15 years.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:13.080]   So while there's a limited amount
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.020]   of any particular cryptocurrency,
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:20.240]   there are an unlimited potential number of cryptocurrencies.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.000]   And if there is an unlimited supply,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.120]   economics tells us that the price will be zero.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.600]   When even Alan Roth is going to have his own coin,
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:33.240]   you know that there's just-- the supply will swamp demand,
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.340]   and the price will inevitably head towards zero.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.640]   Did Rick Perry pay you to pick on me?
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.280]   I applaud Alan Roth for buying Bitcoin.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.160]   I would have done the same thing.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.040]   Not really.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.200]   Anyway, so let's not confuse blockchain technology
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.320]   with Bitcoin.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.080]   Blockchain technology is real.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.400]   It's a way of counting and verifying transactions.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.640]   A lot of companies are going to blockchain technology.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.420]   There will be, in the not too distant future,
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.720]   mutual funds that are based on blockchain technology.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.200]   Not to invest in it, but I mean the coin itself.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.000]   There are already things called initial coin offerings, which
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.720]   are based on company equity, as opposed
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.040]   to going onto a stock market.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.080]   This is coming.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.580]   So blockchain technology is real.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.520]   It's coming.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.200]   We're going to see more of it.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.840]   Now, a Bitcoin is simply a currency
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.320]   which was created based on this blockchain technology.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.240]   And the idea was that it's going to be a global currency.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.680]   I don't know if we're ever going to see global currencies,
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.100]   because the Federal Reserve likes
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.560]   to be able to control money, to be able to control
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.520]   our own interest rates.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.160]   So I think that the government will stop eventually
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.680]   if these things do become used for transactions
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.720]   globally, that if it begins to affect our own money
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.920]   supply and the Federal Reserve's ability to operate,
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.200]   that we're going to see a lot of clamp down on this.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.240]   And we're already seeing it in other countries.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.200]   So let's not confuse Bitcoin with blockchain technology.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.120]   I just wanted to make sure that you understood
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.480]   there's a big difference.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.640]   Yeah, and I would just add one quick note
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.920]   to what Rick just said, which is that to the extent
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.400]   that blockchain technology is real
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.200]   and has enormous potential to transform
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.480]   the way financial transactions are conducted--
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.160]   and I happen to agree, I think it probably does--
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.080]   then the ultimate form of digital currency
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:37.720]   we're likely to see would be Fed coin, Euro coin, BOJ coin,
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:43.440]   and BOC coin, with the Bank of Japan, the Bank of China,
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.840]   the Fed, and the European Central Bank all issuing
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.240]   their own cryptocurrencies.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.840]   And when they do that, it's going
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.600]   to be very hard for private cryptocurrencies to compete.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.680]   I think the problem that a lot of speculators
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.800]   have made, because I would not call anybody, including Allen,
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.000]   of course, who invests in Bitcoin an investor,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.480]   because they're not investing, they're speculating.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.200]   The problem that all these cryptocurrency speculators
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.360]   have made is that they've confused
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   a very good fundamental idea, the idea that currency could
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.680]   be digital and facilitate electronic transactions
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.640]   globally, with the inevitability of any particular
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.920]   cryptocurrency being the one that succeeds,
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:35.760]   in exactly the same way that in 1999 and early 2000,
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.080]   people confused the undeniable, enormous potential
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.040]   of the internet for the idea that I
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.120]   can pick the internet stock that is going
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.880]   to be the great money maker.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.280]   Christine, have you written about it at all?
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.600]   No.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.400]   We keep passing around the Bitcoin specialty,
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:04.040]   but we have not delved into Bitcoin in any great depth.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.720]   OK, let's go on to the next subject.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.800]   And it's kind of a carryover from the last conference
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.480]   that we had, one of the questions that were there.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.680]   It says, here's another follow-up question
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.800]   from last year's conference.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.800]   Several panelists suggested emerging markets
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.120]   were undervalued and would be a good place to invest.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.560]   Since last year, Vanguard Emerging Market Stock Index
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.680]   Fund Admiral shares are down 8%.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.320]   Over the last 10 years, they've only returned 3%.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.560]   So this is from Danielle.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.520]   It says, last year, Jonathan Clements suggested
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.680]   that due to demographics, emerging markets
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.480]   have more potential for growth in the next half century.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.680]   I would like the panel's views on this,
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.120]   especially Mr. Clements.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:51.160]   It's a classic example of the mismatch
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.840]   between the way the financial markets operate
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.960]   and our own expectations of returns.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.520]   If emerging markets are down 8% over the last 12 months,
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.880]   I am 8% more excited about them.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.800]   I'll be told to buy low and sell high.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.960]   If you thought emerging markets were a good idea last year,
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.040]   and I certainly did, I have no reason
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.960]   to think that there are any worse ideas today.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.200]   And in fact, at the current prices,
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.280]   I'm more excited by them.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.080]   So yeah, I have as much in emerging markets
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.680]   as I did a year ago, maybe even somewhat more.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:29.040]   And I fully expect over the next 10-plus years
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.760]   that they will be a great investment.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:36.640]   And I would not advise anybody to put their entire portfolio
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.040]   into emerging markets.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.800]   But if you have, say, 10% of your stock portfolio
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.200]   in emerging markets, I don't think
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.240]   that that's unreasonable.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:48.200]   The nice thing about emerging market stocks
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.240]   is that from time to time, they get to be really cheap.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.880]   And of course, on the way getting there,
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.760]   they can lose you a lot of money.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.640]   Now, in terms of finance theory, you
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.520]   would predict that emerging markets should
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.440]   have higher than average realized returns,
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.480]   because they're riskier.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.280]   I'm not sure that the data are convincing on that subject.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.000]   And in fact, when you look at the very longest time series,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.880]   going back to the year 1900 of what
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.960]   looked like emerging markets stocks then,
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.840]   they actually have returns that are
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.400]   lower than developed markets.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.640]   And there are possible reasons why that's so,
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.120]   having to do with rule of law and shareholder rights.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.040]   What I like to say about Chinese stocks
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.120]   is that a country that doesn't protect its children
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.040]   from lead-contaminated toys is not
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.600]   likely to also protect the interests of foreign minority
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.880]   shareholders.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.520]   That said, I think that a small part of them
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.400]   is a reasonable part of a diversified portfolio,
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.760]   if for no other reason than rebalancing reasons.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.100]   They're very volatile.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.280]   The prices go way up, and the prices go way down.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.760]   And if you're a disciplined, long-term asset allocator,
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.640]   that's a good thing.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:10.680]   I think there's also a myth out there
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.600]   that faster-growing economies relate to faster-growing stock
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.100]   markets.
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:20.880]   And Jason, I believe that's not necessarily true.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.400]   And then just one other thing, people, even advisors,
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.520]   chase performance.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.280]   I profiled dimensional fund advisors, DFA, a few years ago.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.280]   And their largest single fund was their emerging markets fund,
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.880]   because after it had performed well, money moved in.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:47.880]   I don't know when emerging markets
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.540]   are going to turn around.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.880]   So I'm going to give you my long-term investment
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.000]   view of it.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.680]   If you have a total international stock index
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:04.160]   fund, or a global equity fund, Vanguard's VT fund,
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.520]   you're invested probably as much as you should be
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.680]   invested in emerging markets.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:16.080]   In the short term, when the US sort of does something
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.540]   as small as-- we're not getting political-- but tariffs,
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.380]   emerging markets get crushed from that.
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:29.700]   So everything we do in this country just has a domino
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.740]   effect and really hits some of these emerging markets
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.180]   very hard.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.540]   So I don't know when they are going to recover.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.100]   I imagine they will eventually.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.220]   My allocation would just be whatever
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:46.460]   your allocation is to the international index fund.
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.860]   It's got emerging markets in it.
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:48.420]   You're good.
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.380]   Or if you're doing VT, whatever the emerging market
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.020]   allocation is, is good.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.620]   Yeah, in fact, I think that's a good point.
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.620]   And I think that actually the market allocation from VT
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.540]   or from a total international fund
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.500]   is actually an upper bound.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.300]   Because that puts your VT, your emerging markets,
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.140]   are going to be about 10% of your stock allocation.
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.900]   And I think that's kind of an upper bound.
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.600]   I think that it should never exceed that.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.220]   And probably, in many cases, might even be lower than that,
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.140]   unless you're going to invest in VT.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.940]   So DFA was mentioned a second ago.
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.460]   So I'll jump down a few questions.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:31.220]   And DFA, based on Fama French, small cap value
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.700]   is supposed to give added return without added risk.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.980]   So I pulled out the numbers for Vanguard's small cap value
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.860]   and also DFA's small cap value.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.660]   So three years, Vanguard's 8/10 better.
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.500]   Over five years, Vanguard is 2% better.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.100]   Over 10 years, Vanguard is 5% better.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.060]   15 years, Vanguard is 0.5% better.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.580]   Why would anybody invest with DFA?
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.260]   Plus, you have to go through a broker that's
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.740]   been screened, some kind of exclusive thing.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.020]   Reminds me of Costco.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.860]   You've got to go through this broker thing
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.820]   to be able to even buy the DFA funds.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.140]   Why would anybody do that?
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.060]   OK, so I'll answer that.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.500]   If you don't mind, I'll start.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.500]   First of all, it's not a broker.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.340]   It's an advisor.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.860]   They have to have gone through DFA's two-day course,
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.620]   and then they have to be accepted by DFA
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.580]   to be able to use their funds.
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:25.100]   The advisor doesn't get any commission or any kind
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.300]   of benefit from using DFA versus using Vanguard or iShares
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.140]   or anybody else.
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.060]   But it's exclusive, though, right?
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.140]   Not everybody can just start selling DFA funds.
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.180]   Don't you have to go through the course?
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.340]   You have to go through their training.
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.260]   Plus, a lot of the brokerage industry,
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.980]   you can't use them if you're a broker.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.380]   But I should add that the rigor of that training process
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:51.580]   equilibrates to being able to fog a mirror.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.380]   If you're able to survive this two-day conference,
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.340]   you can survive the DFA training.
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.420]   OK, anyway.
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:02.540]   So with that, as far as whether Vanguard's small-cap value
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.020]   fund outperforms DFA's small-cap value fund, it's irrelevant.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.740]   Vanguard calculates small-cap value
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.420]   differently than how DFA calculates small-cap value.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:16.100]   DFA uses a one-factor model, basically book-to-market,
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.660]   which is the reverse of price-to-book.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.580]   Vanguard uses a multi-factor model to do it.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:25.020]   So sometimes price-to-book is the better outperforming value
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.580]   factor.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.500]   Sometimes it's not.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.420]   And when it's not, the Vanguard model,
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.580]   which is a multi-factor model, will outperform.
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:35.340]   So I don't really put any-- looking at past performance,
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.340]   saying Vanguard's way of doing it
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.180]   is better than the way DFA is doing it.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.260]   By the time you get your money invested in Vanguard
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.300]   and you took it out of DFA, I guarantee you
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.260]   that's exactly the day it's all going to reverse.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:51.820]   I think DFA are one of the good guys.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.740]   They're just not Vanguard good.
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.340]   And when I profiled them, they were quite clear
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.860]   that it wasn't a free lunch.
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.900]   It was compensation for taking on more risk.
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.980]   And roughly 15 years ago, I did an experiment.
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:10.620]   I put maybe 5% of my assets in DFA and 95% at Vanguard.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:16.060]   Today, I'm about 2% DFA and 98% Vanguard.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.580]   And my biggest disappointment was really
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:23.340]   the tax inefficiency of a firm that
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.420]   says they're very tax efficient.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:32.500]   So the next question is the most often asked questions.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.860]   And I hope I can express it.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.860]   I'll read three people's different requests,
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:41.340]   but they all kind of fall into the same theme.
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.780]   They're basically worried about the rise of interest rates
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.860]   and why should it be in bonds.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.940]   So the first one's from Fred Berry.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.780]   He should be in the room here somewhere.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.340]   He says, first, thanks for organizing the conference.
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.660]   My question is, for fixed income, part of our asset
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.700]   allocation, what are the pros and cons
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:01.420]   of using CDs or CD ladders instead of a US bond fund?
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.900]   And he says, note, I don't have any international bonds.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.700]   And then Trey Parrish, he should also
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.220]   be in the room here somewhere.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.180]   Is rising interest rate environment,
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.860]   is a CD or treasury ladder better
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.220]   than going into a bond fund?
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.980]   And Mark Miller is also in the room.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.460]   With rising interest rates, what other lower risk options
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.500]   should one look at as an alternative to bonds?
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.380]   Should we just sit it out or should we put it in there
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.020]   and accept that our principal's going to go down?
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.300]   Alan has to go first.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.500]   You can take the CD portion.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.580]   Thank you, Jason.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:39.460]   First of all, what I don't do is ladder CDs.
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.140]   We buy longer term CDs that have very easy early withdrawal
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:43.860]   penalties.
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.420]   And it's essentially a put, the right
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.940]   to sell it back to the bank if interest rates go up,
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:51.220]   rather than take the loss.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.500]   Total bond fund, in an extreme example, would lose--
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.860]   I just calculated-- 19.27% if interest rates
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.580]   rose 4 percentage points in one year.
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.500]   With, let's say, an Ally Bank CD,
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.980]   you earn roughly the same interest.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:08.860]   But with a five month penalty, you'd make 1.75%.
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.260]   That's the first part of it.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.100]   The second part, it's an incredible myth
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.060]   that we are in a rising rate environment.
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.500]   Rates have risen just a bit.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.300]   The Fed controls the overnight rate, nothing more.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.260]   Top economists have called the direction of the 10 year
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:30.060]   Treasury right up or down 30% of the time less than a coin flip.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.900]   So we don't know what rates are going to do.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:37.580]   So I use a combination of CDs and bond funds.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.620]   Right now with the flatter yield curve,
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.060]   if clients want some short term bond index fund,
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.340]   I'm absolutely fine with that.
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:47.940]   Because last I looked, there was only about a 30 BIP difference
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.780]   in yield.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.540]   I think Alan's absolutely right.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.340]   And I would say it comes down to time horizon.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:59.420]   If someone has a time horizon of fewer than two years,
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.340]   then I think cash probably is the right investment,
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.660]   true cash instruments.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.980]   And then stepping out from there,
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.540]   where presumably you aren't going
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.860]   to need to get at that money for spending,
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.580]   I think you can afford to endure maybe
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.940]   a little bit of interest rate related volatility
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.020]   if that continues.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.700]   And you probably will earn a higher return over time
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.820]   in exchange for being willing to tolerate that volatility.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.180]   So I do think time horizon and thinking
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.740]   about your spending horizon is key when
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.900]   deciding the right allocation between cash and bonds.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.100]   I would also mind inflation.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.860]   Because we have begun to see inflation
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.420]   look a little hotter than it has in years past.
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:47.420]   So for people who are actively drawing upon their portfolios,
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.780]   I think maintaining an allocation
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:53.580]   to inflation-protected bonds makes sense as well.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.300]   Yeah, two minor points.
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:59.700]   Number one is that stocks have a very slight tendency
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.580]   to mean revert.
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.300]   Bonds have zero tendency to mean revert.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.260]   So if rates go to 10% either at the short or the long end
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.540]   or both, you shouldn't reassure yourself
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:13.460]   that they can only fall, as people to their chagrin
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.220]   found out in the late 1970s.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.020]   Second, Alan, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.300]   but I think the last I looked a couple of days
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.460]   ago at the short end, treasuries actually
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.860]   had higher yields than CDs.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:35.140]   I think you can buy five-year CDs at about up to 3.2% now.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.860]   I'm pretty sure that five-year treasury is--
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:43.380]   3.06% or 3.09% plus they're state tax-free.
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.420]   Yeah, that's true if you live in it.
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.740]   And for a long time, I've been writing stash your cash rather
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.660]   than a Vanguard money market fund,
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.500]   stash it at a high-yield savings account.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.820]   Right now, I think the Vanguard treasury--
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.460]   and that's not the default fund.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:03.060]   You have to ask for it, and it's a $50,000 minimum--
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:09.940]   is yielding just over 2% and is state tax-exempt.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.900]   Yeah, I mean, I guess the only thing I would add
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:18.540]   is that tax-exempt money market funds, particularly at Vanguard,
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:22.580]   are quite attractive to people who live in high-tax states,
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:28.060]   like me and Jonathan and many people in this room.
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:34.660]   I mean, you can get a pre-tax yield of 150 basis points
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.060]   and up.
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.540]   And if it's just your cash that you're
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:43.140]   keeping around for liquidity, that's a very attractive carry
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:45.540]   after tax.
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.260]   So just two quick points.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.140]   So one, a lot of this has to do with expectations.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:53.620]   I mean, Alan just described apocalypse, the bond market.
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.220]   We have a full percentage point rise in interest rates,
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:00.100]   and your total bond market fund is down 19%.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.020]   I think a full percentage point rise in interest rates
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.780]   from here in the short term would be extraordinary.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.940]   And yet, you would only lose 19%.
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.640]   I mean, if you're a stock market investor
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.500]   and you're not prepared to lose 19% tomorrow,
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.980]   you shouldn't be in stocks.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.260]   Our expectations for the bond side of our portfolio
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.260]   are so different from our stock side of our portfolio.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.380]   We expect our money to be there, and that's
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:28.660]   why people get freaked out by rising interest rates.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.940]   But let's say you have a five-year time horizon
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:33.100]   and you're choosing between a five-year CD
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.780]   or buying a short-to-intermediate-term bond
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.820]   fund, I would bet that over that five-year period,
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:43.740]   returns are likely to be very similar.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.780]   What you get with the CD is really twofold.
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:50.220]   One, there is the comfort of knowing precisely what you're
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.980]   going to have after five years.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.100]   But you're going to get pretty similar
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.060]   with that short-to-intermediate-term bond fund.
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.180]   The result is not going to be that different.
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.900]   But two, the CD does have that valuable option,
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.860]   which is you can bail at any time
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.620]   and pay the early withdrawal penalty
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.460]   and then reinvest it at a higher rate.
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.060]   So to that extent, the CD does have a slight edge.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:13.180]   But I'm not sure that, given the potentially lower yield,
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.700]   that I would pay up for that option.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:20.740]   So there were three parts to this rising interest rate
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:21.260]   question.
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:25.020]   The first one was, what are the pros and cons of buying CDs?
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:29.580]   And Alan has been a big advocate for buying CDs as far out
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.180]   as you can and then pay the penalty.
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.260]   And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.900]   I mean, you're FDIC insured.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.820]   You just have to be careful you don't go past--
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.980]   I think it's the $250,000, and you
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.140]   need to do a different one.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:42.300]   You actually need to kind of keep an eye on it
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.740]   and manage that portion of your portfolio
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.200]   rather than just putting in a fund.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.220]   It's easy.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:52.100]   So there's nothing wrong with the CD idea that Alan has.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.060]   The second thing was, should you do a bond ladder
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.260]   versus buying a bond fund?
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:01.140]   Well, I think when you look at most intermediate-term bond
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.020]   funds, they're pretty much a ladder anyway,
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.380]   if you look at the structure of the maturities.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.660]   So you can go out, and you can buy individual bonds.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.060]   What do you do with the interest?
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.660]   Well, you would have to reinvest it.
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.740]   When bonds come due, you have to reinvest it.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.900]   That's pretty much what an intermediate-term bond
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.340]   fund does anyway.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.620]   So I don't see the big benefit of buying individual bonds
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:24.300]   versus buying a bond fund.
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.980]   I would just make it easy and go with the bond fund.
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:31.540]   The last thing was, well, what do you do to lower your risk?
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.540]   And Christine mentioned TIPS, Treasury Inflation Protected
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.740]   Securities, where if you think that interest rates are going
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:43.820]   up because inflation is going up, then TIPS make good sense.
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:49.020]   However, realize that there are two parts to the return
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:49.700]   of TIPS.
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.020]   One is the inflation component, and one
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.500]   is the real return component.
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.900]   And if inflation doesn't go up, but the real return
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.900]   on interest rates do go up, then the value of TIPS
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:05.940]   isn't really going to help you, because the real interest rates
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.420]   go up, and the inflation stays the same.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.820]   TIPS are going to get beat up, just like every other bond.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.220]   So realize there's two components to TIPS.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:17.020]   So to me, if your liabilities are intermediate-term,
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:20.500]   just buying an intermediate-term bond index fund works.
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.380]   If your liabilities are short-term,
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.220]   or whatever amount is short-term,
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:25.860]   keeping that money in the money market
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.500]   or keeping it in short-term bond funds
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.260]   makes sense for that portion of your money.
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:35.540]   So a little change of pace.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.380]   And the privilege of putting this together,
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.060]   I'm going to ask a personal question.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.740]   So this isn't the average group.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.300]   Most people can't come up with $500.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.180]   And I have a feeling that most people in here
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.100]   are flagship members, and they've
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.860]   done very well because they focused on investing.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.300]   So the question I have is, how do you
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:59.820]   teach your kids character traits like honesty, and hard work,
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:04.020]   and compassion for others, and not focus on money
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.580]   to convince them that money shouldn't
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.460]   be the center of their world, their character should
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.620]   be the center of their world?
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:16.300]   Next question.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.740]   I haven't figured that one out yet.
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:24.060]   So I think you should ask our kids that question now.
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:24.580]   Two things.
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.100]   I think I said this last year.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.500]   Write a book with your son called
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.420]   How a Second Grader Beat Wall Street.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.460]   But look, I knew how to be-- I think I lucked out.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.660]   I have a great kid.
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:38.700]   Like any dad, I'm very proud of my child.
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.660]   But I knew how to be an absolutely perfect parent
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:42.740]   until I had a kid.
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.580]   Not so easy.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:48.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:52.500]   I think that simply making conversations
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.660]   about financial and non-financial issues
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:00.180]   part of dinner time conversation is the key.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:04.260]   Just talk about what's important to you,
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.580]   how you conduct yourself in your daily lives,
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.820]   how you manage your portfolio.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:13.820]   Talking honestly about the mistakes you've made,
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.460]   the things you've done right, having those conversations
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.820]   on a daily basis is probably more powerful
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.180]   than anything you can do.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.340]   You can construct elaborate reward systems
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.420]   to get your kids to do one thing or another.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.700]   And I certainly did a fair amount of that with my kids.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:31.260]   It was sort of fun manipulating them.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:36.100]   But simply talking to your kids openly and honestly, I think,
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:39.620]   is more valuable than anything else you can do.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:44.460]   Kids are really good at detecting hypocrisy.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.420]   And I don't think--
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.540]   most of what you're going to be doing is nonverbal.
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.660]   They're going to be observing you and watching you.
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:55.340]   And if you're into McMansions and Beamers,
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.460]   there's nothing you're going to be able to tell them
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.740]   about frugality.
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.340]   They're going to be watching how you invest, how you save,
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.380]   and how you spend, and what you doing
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.660]   is probably what they're going to wind up doing.
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.700]   So I'll tell you one story that I did with my daughter
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:12.700]   about 10 years ago.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.420]   She's 30 years old now, so she was 20 at the time.
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.340]   I'd saved about a couple of thousand dollars.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.140]   She says, what should I do with it?
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.420]   I want this to be a long-term investment.
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:27.340]   So I said, put it in the Vanguard Total Stock Market
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.060]   Index Fund.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.020]   So she did.
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:36.220]   Then the market went down, and she got panicky,
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:39.940]   and she wanted to pull the money out because her $1,000 was only
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.540]   worth $800.
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:47.500]   So I said to her, let's make a deal.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.940]   You take the $800 out, and--
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:56.700]   no, what I said to her was, if you hold that fund for 10 more
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:01.700]   years, if you lost money after 10 years,
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.580]   I will make up every dollar you lost.
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.540]   So it is a risk-free investment.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:14.580]   However, if it goes up, I get half of the gain.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:19.240]   The stockbroker, she looked at me, and she said, I'm good.
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:29.020]   You would make a really lousy equity index insurance company
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:29.520]   salesman.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.460]   So I had a lesson go wrong.
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:34.620]   My daughter called me up.
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.020]   She says-- she always pooped me.
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.520]   We'd sit around at the dinner table.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.260]   I says, tonight we're going to talk about zero-coupon bonds
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.020]   and how they work.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.900]   They said, oh, Dad, get off your soapbox.
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:43.900]   We're sick of that.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.780]   So she poopooed me until she was like 35.
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.260]   She called me up, says, I want to buy a share of Apple.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:50.860]   And I said, well, that's not investing.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:51.580]   You're gambling.
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:54.220]   I want to buy-- OK, you buy one, I'll buy 10.
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.580]   Son of a gun if it didn't split seven for one
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.140]   and go right to the moon.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.140]   So sometimes it can go wrong.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.260]   So Mel, maybe I'll jump in because I
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.300]   think there are some people in the room who have young kids.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:15.780]   And I think one message that I would send to you
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:20.300]   is be patient with your kids about how
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.580]   they absorb the lessons you're trying to give them.
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:27.420]   And I'll tell a story.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:32.620]   When my older daughter was about 14, I guess,
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.060]   I walked into her bedroom and she wasn't there,
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.020]   but all the lights were on.
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.660]   And I can't-- well, this is a room full of bogleheads.
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:40.700]   You'd all be mad.
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.220]   I was really mad.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.140]   And so I turned the lights off.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:50.020]   And then she came back and got in an argument with me.
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:54.260]   And so I sat down on the bed and I told her my dad's
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:59.580]   favorite story about how when he was a kid growing up
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:01.860]   on a farm in northern New York State,
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.100]   he was the youngest of three boys,
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.580]   so he had the worst job, which was
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:09.860]   to fetch the water in the morning.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:13.380]   And they had no indoor running water.
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.180]   He had to go out to the pump.
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:21.300]   And in January and February, it would be 20 or 30 below zero
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.780]   at 4:30 in the morning.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.860]   And my dad's pants would freeze.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:29.100]   And he would walk into the house with his pants legs clanking.
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:33.340]   And so on his 16th birthday, my grandfather
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:38.540]   bought a pump, a power pump, a generator
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.900]   that would pump the water.
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.980]   So my dad didn't have to do it by hand.
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:47.060]   And so the first day, my dad was out there.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.620]   And he pumped the water using the electric pump.
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.580]   And he was so excited, he filled the first bucket.
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.620]   And he leaned down to fill the second bucket.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.800]   And the next thing he knew, he was flying through the air.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.620]   And he smashed against the wall of the barn.
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:07.020]   And my grandfather's fist was in the middle of his shirt.
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:10.540]   And my grandfather, who was an immigrant from Eastern Europe,
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:14.860]   held my dad up against the wall of the barn and said,
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.860]   you hear them thumps?
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.620]   And in the background, the pump was
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.700]   thumping over and over again.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.620]   He said, every one of them thumps is a nickel.
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:31.100]   And my dad told me that story when I was 14.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:34.740]   And I've never left a light on ever since.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:37.940]   And so I tell this story to my daughter.
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.540]   And she's like, yeah, OK, Dad.
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.380]   And I come home the next night.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.300]   And of course, all the lights are on.
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.140]   But now she's 24.
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:53.820]   And she pays her own utility bill.
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.940]   And now she turns off all the lights.
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.300]   So the lessons will sink in.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.300]   But it could take years.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.420]   Yeah, I mean, I've got a story which is not
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.820]   quite as good as that, but it's in the same vein, which
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:09.300]   is our youngest son was probably the spendthrift
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.220]   of our children.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:14.020]   And one day, when he's 19, he's in college.
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:14.980]   He calls up his mother.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.060]   And he says, you know, Mom, I just
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.580]   learned something really cool.
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.980]   When you buy frozen orange juice,
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.820]   it's cheaper than buying the cartons.
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:29.660]   And his mother said, yes, I know that.
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:33.020]   And she says, can I borrow one of your plastic cartons?
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:36.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:42.020]   So the next question is kind of a behavioral question, too,
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.020]   just like the last one.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.940]   So I'm going to start with a quote from Will Rogers.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.580]   It says, too many people spend money
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.940]   they haven't earned to buy things they don't want
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.260]   to impress people they really don't like.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.980]   And to give you an example, Alan Everson
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:00.220]   made $200 million in his lifetime, went bankrupt.
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:04.060]   Nicolas Cage made $150 million, went bankrupt.
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:08.220]   Kurt Schilling, $150 million, went bankrupt.
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.700]   MC Hammer, $50 million, went bankrupt.
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.900]   Lindsay Lohan, $20 million, went bankrupt.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.060]   So here's the question.
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:18.380]   I heard the term hedonic adaptation
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.620]   promoting an article by Jonathan Clements.
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:23.580]   And I noticed the behavior the people are associated with.
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:27.420]   Then I also began to notice that I was bombarded by messages
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:30.100]   that I should buy stuff because it would make me look smart,
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.580]   make me look successful, and make me look beautiful.
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:36.740]   So what is your recommendation on how to not get caught up
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.300]   in the hedonic treadmill?
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.740]   And would you please start by defining it
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:41.820]   for our group, Jonathan?
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:48.900]   So the hedonic treadmill-- I'm sure many of you
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.820]   do know what it is-- is this continuous cycle
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.940]   we go through where we anticipate the next promotion
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.820]   or pay raise or purchase.
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.940]   And we have it in our minds that if only we
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.180]   do get the promotion or the pay raise
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:06.660]   or we buy the new car, we're going to be endlessly happy.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.700]   And when we finally get the news that we
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:11.420]   can take over the car or we're getting the promotion,
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.380]   we are indeed thrilled.
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.180]   But then in the days and weeks that follow,
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.100]   we become increasingly dissatisfied.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:20.740]   And we end up back in the same place where we started.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.820]   So in other words, money has not bought happiness.
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.220]   And indeed, the long-term statistics tell us this.
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:32.220]   In 1972, 30% of Americans described themselves
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:35.380]   as very happy, according to the General Social Survey.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.920]   In 2016, the latest General Social Survey,
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.340]   exactly 30% of Americans described themselves
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:42.580]   as very happy.
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:46.220]   In the intervening 44 years, US inflation
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:50.580]   adjusted per capita disposable income rose 119%.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:54.260]   So we lived twice as well, more than twice as well
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:55.980]   as we did four decades ago.
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.940]   And yet, our point level happiness has not budged.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:03.660]   So the question is, how can you get off the hedonic treadmill
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:08.380]   and squeeze more happiness out of the dollars that you have?
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:12.020]   And I contend that there are sort of three keys
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.700]   to getting greater happiness out of your dollars.
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:17.380]   First, money is sort of like health.
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:19.060]   It's only when we're ill do we realize
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.500]   how great it is to feel good.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.060]   Similarly, it's only when we're broke
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.560]   that we realize how great it is to be
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.760]   in good financial condition.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.540]   So simply having your finances in decent shape
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.620]   so you don't worry about money on a daily basis
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:35.340]   is one of the benefits you can get out of money.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:40.620]   Second, money allows us to spend time with friends and family,
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.620]   and particularly times with friends and family
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.020]   where we have great experiences.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.580]   One of the things that you discover
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.700]   when you talk to people as they grow older
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.620]   is they become less focused on buying material goods
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:54.660]   and more focused on creating memorable experiences
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:55.740]   with friends and family.
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.020]   Going out to dinner, arranging the family reunion,
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.700]   taking everybody to Disneyland, god forbid.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.220]   They do these--
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.380]   Going to Bogleheads.
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.980]   Going to Bogleheads, bringing the whole family, right.
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.100]   And then the third way that you can use money
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:13.300]   is you can achieve a level of financial freedom
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.100]   where you can design a life for yourself
[00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.820]   where you spend your days doing what you think is important,
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:21.500]   what you're passionate about, what you find challenging.
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.920]   And for many people, that moment arrives when they retire.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.380]   If you're really smart about money,
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.420]   you start saving from a young age,
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:30.500]   it may be that you get into your 40s and your 50s
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.140]   and you can change careers.
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:35.340]   Get out of that boring corporate job and stuck in that cubicle
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.260]   and go and do something that maybe may pay you
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.740]   a small paycheck, but could make you
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.060]   feel like you're contributing more to the world.
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:45.380]   So that is my three-part prescription
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:47.220]   for getting off the hedonic treadmill.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.060]   Any other suggestions?
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.100]   I have a simple one.
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:58.540]   Spend less time on your cell phone.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:00.980]   That's good.
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:04.460]   So most of us in this room use Jack Bogle's philosophy
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.060]   of investing, which is to diversify
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:09.820]   broad-based passively managed index funds.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:13.060]   And here's a quote from an intelligent investor
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.580]   from Jason's Wags article.
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.100]   It says, "The market is a pendulum
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.700]   that ever swings between unsustainable optimism, which
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:24.260]   makes stock too expensive, to unjustified pessimism, which
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.020]   makes them too cheap.
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.860]   The intelligent investor is a realist
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:31.340]   who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists."
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.260]   Warren Buffett also said, "Buy when
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.580]   there's blood in the street, even if it's your blood."
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:41.020]   To the novice investor, they get confused.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:42.660]   What was that?
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.700]   To the novice investor, they get confused,
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.360]   because sometimes it sounds like there's
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.420]   a little bit of market timing that's taking place in there.
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.460]   So for the novice, they're trying to figure out,
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.060]   what do I do?
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.740]   Do I buy something, stay the course?
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:56.780]   Or am I waiting for the stock market to go down to buy it?
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:04.980]   I think the answer to that is for an investor who
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:08.500]   wants to maybe harness that sentiment a little bit,
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:09.940]   but not engage in market timing, I
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.820]   think rebalancing is a great suggestion,
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:16.540]   especially given that we are 10 years into the current equity
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.900]   market rally.
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.340]   We're all 10 years older.
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:22.900]   I do think that investors, especially
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:25.260]   those who are, say, over 50 and starting
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:28.220]   to think seriously about retirement and when it will be,
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:31.380]   or if you're already retired, certainly,
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:36.060]   I think of rebalancing as kind of a chicken way of making sure
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:38.900]   that you are selling high.
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:42.820]   So I advocate rebalancing, especially
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.460]   for people who are getting close to retirement.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:50.500]   For younger investors, I think it's maybe less essential,
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:56.020]   but perhaps worthwhile to look at sort of intra-equity
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:56.940]   exposure.
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:00.900]   So maybe the value to growth split
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.980]   in terms of your style box exposure,
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:07.340]   if you've been hands-off and you have multiple funds that
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:09.260]   compose your equity exposure, you
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.540]   might look at whether you're listing to the growth
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:13.660]   side of the style box.
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:17.820]   And similarly with the US versus international exposure,
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.740]   take a look at that and see where you stand.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:24.100]   If you've been hands-off, your international equity component
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:28.140]   would be down, probably relative to even
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:31.900]   total international index.
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:35.580]   One of my favorite quotes is from John Templeton,
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:40.180]   who said that bull markets are born in despair,
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:47.100]   rise on pessimism, mature in optimism, and die in euphoria.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:51.940]   The best time to buy is at the point of maximum pessimism.
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:53.820]   So that kind of suggests that maybe you
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.300]   should wait until the market crashes to buy.
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.060]   The problem is that's not what the data show.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:01.740]   In most cases, you're just better
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:07.140]   off lump summing at whatever point that you're at.
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:09.980]   At least that works 2/3 of the time, 1/3 of the time,
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:10.480]   it doesn't.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:14.460]   So the odds are in your favor.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:18.020]   You can dollar cost average over a period of time.
[00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.380]   And that is suboptimal.
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:23.860]   But it's a wonderful psychological crutch.
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:28.460]   Because as Casey-- I think it was Yogi Berra who supposedly
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:33.000]   said that 90% of this game is one half mental.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.900]   And if you can win the mental game,
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.140]   you can win the psychological game.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.060]   Then you can generally win the investing game.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:41.540]   And dollar cost averaging, although suboptimal,
[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:42.800]   is a good way to do that.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.420]   In other words, another way of saying
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:47.260]   that is that a suboptimal strategy you can execute
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:50.220]   is better than an optimal one you can't.
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.740]   Well, so just a quick thought.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:59.060]   In his autobiography, The Confessions,
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:03.460]   St. Augustine famously said, "Oh Lord, make me virtuous,
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:06.660]   but not yet."
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:09.100]   When he was living a life of sin.
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:13.940]   And I think the easiest thing for investors to do
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:17.980]   is to say, I will buy when blood is running in the streets,
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:21.180]   even if it is my own.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:24.940]   But even if it's not your own, and the blood
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.940]   is running in the streets, it is much harder
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:31.580]   to buy then than you could possibly imagine.
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:37.980]   And I think it's great if you are
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:42.260]   one of the people who can buy when blood is running
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:47.580]   in the streets, and if you do have an extremely long horizon,
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.460]   a half century or longer.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:58.100]   I did it in 2008 and 2009, and it was not easy or comfortable.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:02.020]   In a column I wrote about a year or two ago, I guess,
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:08.060]   I went back and looked, and between October 2007 and March
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:18.220]   2009, I made 53 additional discretionary purchases
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:22.420]   in my Vanguard index funds, in addition to the dollar cost
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:24.140]   averaging I was doing automatically.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:26.340]   So 53 separate times.
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:29.540]   As the market was going down, I put more money in.
[00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:36.260]   And I stopped on-- I made my last of those purchases
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:41.700]   on March 6, 2009, because I couldn't stand it anymore.
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:44.420]   And the market bottomed on March 9.
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:49.060]   And when I did it, I said, watch everybody.
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:50.620]   I'm going to make the market go up,
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:52.540]   because I can't stand it anymore.
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:54.260]   And of course, it happened.
[00:56:54.260 --> 00:57:00.180]   But the thing is, I kept it a secret from my wife,
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:02.500]   from whom I keep no secrets.
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:06.300]   Because I knew if I told her, she'd kill me.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:12.020]   And now she tells everybody that she's really glad I didn't.
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:15.780]   The most profitable purchases you will ever make
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.500]   will be when you feel like throwing up.
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:22.500]   Could you ask that last-- the actual question one more time?
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.740]   I'm not sure I got it right.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.700]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.540]   I'm not sure I can go back and find it, Rick.
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:28.160]   I'll be honest.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.700]   I flipped so many pages here.
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:31.380]   Can I just add one thing?
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:31.880]   Oh, here.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:33.660]   We have short memories.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:36.100]   Yes.
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:36.620]   Go ahead.
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:37.580]   I'm sorry, Tom.
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:39.900]   It says, novice investors get confused,
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.420]   because it sounds like there might
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:44.220]   be some market timing involved in both of those statements.
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:44.900]   So what is it?
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:48.220]   Buy and hold, stay the course, or wait for the markets
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:50.740]   to go down and buy?
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:53.500]   OK.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.740]   I would just argue we have very short memories.
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:58:03.420]   I guess the answer is, if you've been on a-- if you had a plan,
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:06.100]   and your plan was to invest regularly,
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:10.900]   like most people who are working and putting money into a 401(k),
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.500]   just continue to do it.
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:17.060]   Like Jason said, you have a long time horizon.
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:22.260]   If you happen to get a windfall-- I'm not talking about a windfall
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:27.260]   from retiring and getting a 401(k) that was 60/40 in stocks,
[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:30.000]   and then you have to convert that to cash,
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.580]   and now you've got all this cash, what should you do with it?
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:35.040]   In my opinion, since it was already invested,
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:38.420]   you just take that and invest it the way it needs to be.
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.540]   But I'm talking about an actual windfall of money
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:44.780]   that comes from, say, winning the lottery.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:45.620]   Whatever.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:48.780]   The-- that is a little bit more difficult.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:51.540]   In that case, you might dollar cost average.
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:54.300]   I actually wrote an article about dollar cost averaging
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:55.020]   and when to do it.
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:55.940]   Bill is correct.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:59.060]   Most of the time, you're not better off mathematically dollar
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:00.460]   cost averaging.
[00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:04.340]   But depending on how you get the money, how it comes to you,
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:07.820]   sometimes it just feels better to dollar cost average.
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:10.380]   And there's a higher probability that you're
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.500]   going to stick with your plan if you dollar cost average.
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.820]   So that's what you should do.
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:16.820]   Well, follow up to that.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.860]   Everybody says, well, why don't we just put it in index funds
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:20.620]   and not look at it?
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.980]   So there was another question that
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.380]   asked later in the panel here, if indexing is the way to go,
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:29.140]   how do you explain the performance of prime cap
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:33.060]   and capital opportunity where they're beating the market?
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:35.220]   Why not just put it in an actively managed fund
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.620]   like that that's doing so well?
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:37.100]   OK.
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:42.340]   So let's get away from this future prediction of beating
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:46.620]   and just call it have beaten, past tense.
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:51.980]   We don't know-- prime cap has done very well.
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:55.540]   There is going to be active managers who outperform.
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:56.140]   We know that.
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:58.980]   We just don't know who they are going to be going forward.
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:00.380]   Is it going to be prime cap?
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.180]   I don't know.
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.420]   Just four words as an answer to that, which
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.700]   is Legg Mason Value Trust.
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.580]   For those of you who aren't familiar with it,
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:12.940]   it beat the S&P 500 not just over a 15-year period,
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:16.420]   but for 15 consecutive years.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:19.460]   If anybody looked like a winner, it was Bill Miller.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.340]   And in about three short years, he
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:26.220]   gave back all of that 15 years of outperformance.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:28.020]   So let me ask one more question, and then
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.380]   we're going to go to the panel, each of you,
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:30.500]   to get about two minutes there.
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.760]   So this will be the last question that we get to ask.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.540]   Sorry, we have 30 questions, and we only
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:38.540]   got to ask about 15, which was typical last year also.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:41.380]   So the question is, why should I own bonds paying 3%
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:44.300]   when I can own a dividend-paying stock that's
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:48.260]   paying out more than 3% and has potential upsides besides?
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:51.820]   For example, Pepsi is a dividend aristocrat,
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:54.540]   which means it's raised its dividend every year
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.020]   for the last 25 years.
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.540]   And it's paying 3.25%, while the 10-year Treasury
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.540]   is only paying 3.05%.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.580]   So if the share price goes down, I
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.340]   don't really care because I continue
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.100]   to get the dividend.
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:12.380]   There's 24 dividend aristocrats that are paying over 3%.
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.980]   So why should I own a bond if I can
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:16.660]   get a dividend aristocrat?
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:18.540]   That's an easy one.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:25.940]   General Electric, Eastman Kodak, General Motors--
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:28.260]   so goes GM, goes America.
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.660]   Boy, I'm glad that wasn't true.
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:34.440]   Total Return, Master Limited Partnerships--
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.140]   they're just safe alternatives to a bond.
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:38.260]   It's a toll road.
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.860]   The oil and the gas has to flow through it.
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.500]   It's just a 6% safe return until they
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:47.020]   lost a third of their value.
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.420]   Yeah, again, I have two words for someone
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.060]   who wants to buy Pepsi-Cola, which is sugar tax.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:02:00.620]   In the Great Recession, 2008-2009 market decline,
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:04.220]   the dividends paid by the S&P 500 companies
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:07.180]   dropped, I believe, was 23%.
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:11.480]   So anybody who bought S&P 500 companies thinking that they
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.900]   could just live off the dividends,
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.780]   and it was a substitute for owning bonds,
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:18.980]   would have seen the income they received drop 23%.
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:20.660]   That did not happen with Treasury bonds.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:26.380]   Alan Roth-- I'm going to give him credit again.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.420]   My gosh, what's happening to me?
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:28.340]   I must be getting old.
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:30.580]   Something's wrong here.
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.860]   Alan wrote an article about the total return.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.220]   A dividend is the cash that a company pays,
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:39.740]   but what if you just sold a little bit of your equity
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:40.840]   every year?
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.580]   And because dividends have been going down,
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:45.340]   it just has to do with the way companies have
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.540]   been capitalizing themselves.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:50.380]   They're buying back stock, and generally, when
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.940]   you look at stock buybacks or the buyback dividend,
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.220]   it's not included in the cash dividend.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.180]   However, Alan wrote a good article
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:00.420]   about if you just treated the buyback,
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.420]   you looked at how much buyback was going on,
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:04.740]   and you actually sold that much stock,
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:08.300]   and you paid yourself a dividend, it's all the same.
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:09.820]   So it doesn't have to be dividends.
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.460]   I mean, if you're buying a total stock market fund,
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:15.700]   and you need 4% from it, you get 2% from the dividend,
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:18.260]   and then you just sell 2% per year.
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.120]   And a lot of that is simply the buybacks
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.460]   that have been taking place which
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:22.820]   caused the market to go up.
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.260]   So correct me, Alan, if I'm wrong,
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.900]   it's not about--
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:27.980]   - You're wrong.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.060]   - Am I wrong?
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.020]   'Cause I quoted you, is that what I--
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.500]   (laughing)
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.180]   But that's, you know, there's no,
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:38.140]   dividend-paying stocks kind of make you feel good,
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.460]   oh, I'm getting a dividend.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.620]   But in reality, the way the stock market works
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:45.380]   is that the total return of the market
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:49.400]   is dividend, capital gains, buybacks, everything,
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.780]   and it doesn't matter whether you're buying stocks
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:52.380]   that pay higher dividends or you're buying stocks
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.820]   that pay no dividends.
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.580]   In theory, the total return of each group
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.700]   is going to be the same.
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:04.700]   So I think it just makes you feel good, that's it.
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.040]   - Okay, so that's the end of our session.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.100]   Questions, I have a lot more questions
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:11.020]   I'd love to be able to get to.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.140]   So we'd like to give each panel a couple minutes
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:15.500]   to reveal any projects they're working on.
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.060]   We'd like to ask them to take a moment
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.280]   to tell them what inspired them
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.880]   to take the path they've chosen
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.140]   or to share any gems of wisdom they may have.
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:27.320]   Or any way that we can all become better investors.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.360]   So could each of you just give a couple minutes
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:32.400]   of what you're thinking we could use?
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.320]   - Well, if you want to learn to be a better investor,
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.900]   let me go first, because at the end of the table, it's Alan.
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.900]   (audience laughing)
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:45.600]   Okay, well, first of all,
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.640]   I'm gonna be giving a little presentation
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.160]   in about 1.30 here in the room
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.560]   about a new book that I'm working on
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:54.440]   called "The Education of an Index Investor,"
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.360]   and sort of the mindset of what people go through
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.560]   to get to a certain, to get to John Bogle's level,
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.800]   if you will, what actually happens in your head
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.000]   to get to that point, and it's quite a bit.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.560]   And it's a long journey.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.320]   In addition to that, I'm no longer the owner
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.500]   or involved at all in Portfolio Solutions.
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.480]   My company was acquired, and there's a long story there.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.840]   It's on my website.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:18.160]   But I'm working on another company called Core4 Investing,
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.080]   which is a model portfolio company
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.000]   that you'll be able to go on
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.360]   and see very simple portfolios
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.620]   using four or less index funds.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.640]   And I'm working on that.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.460]   It should be up.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.120]   It's all free, free content.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.680]   In addition to that, in April,
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.040]   when my non-compete is over with,
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.720]   I'm actually emulating Alan's model.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.200]   And I am-- (audience applauding)
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.680]   And he's been helping me quite a bit
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:46.680]   in formulating the hourly advising that I'll be doing.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.960]   And I thank Alan for giving me a lot of advice in there.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.240]   So that's what I'm up to.
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:56.640]   So most of my days are devoted
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.240]   to running this website, humbledollar.com,
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:04.240]   which I've had going for since early last year.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.920]   More and more people are discovering it.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.480]   If you haven't been to humbledollar.com, please go.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.340]   I put out a free newsletter twice a month.
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.520]   There's something new on the website every day,
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.240]   so I encourage you to check it out.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:20.720]   My latest book came out last month.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:23.280]   It's called From Here to Financial Happiness.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.920]   And the book is designed to help people
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.100]   figure out what they want from their financial life
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.680]   and then help them to settle on the steps
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.880]   that they need to take.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.520]   One of the principal drivers of the book
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:43.000]   is the fact that most of us are really bad
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.080]   at figuring out what we want from our lives.
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:50.840]   And if you disagree with me, when you get home,
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.520]   go downstairs and check out the basement.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.520]   Basements are badly curated museums
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.760]   dedicated to the purchases that we have made.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.320]   We can't yet bring ourselves to trash.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:07.480]   We are extremely bad at figuring out
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.920]   what we want for our financial lives.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.520]   We pursue careers that make us unhappy.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:16.520]   We purchase items that we quickly become dissatisfied with.
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:19.600]   So one of the things that I try to encourage people
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.240]   to do in my new book is to think much harder
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.000]   about their financial lives.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.280]   So one of the tricks that I would encourage you to use
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.200]   when you get home is get a piece of paper
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:36.200]   and write down what you plan to spend money on
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.000]   over the next couple of years.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.120]   It might be a home renovation.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.320]   It might be a vacation.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.160]   It might be a new car.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:48.160]   It might be buying some new electronic goods.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.680]   Whatever it is, write it on the list,
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.120]   stick it on the refrigerator,
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.520]   and every couple of weeks go back and revise that list.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.680]   And what you will do if you use that strategy
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.240]   is that you will have a much better idea
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.920]   of what you want from your money.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:08.840]   Don't instinctively assume that you know what you want.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:11.720]   Instead, figure out what you want from your money.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.840]   Takes substantial amount of reflection.
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.600]   Drawing up a wish list, revisiting it regularly
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.480]   will force you to go through that process of reflection,
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:22.640]   and I think you'll find out,
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.040]   find that you spend your money much more wisely.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:32.000]   - Yeah, so I never imagined for a minute
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.520]   that I would ever catch up to Jonathan
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.920]   who wrote 1,009, right?
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.680]   1,009. - My first outing.
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.840]   - Yeah, 1,009 columns for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:46.880]   If I write 486 more, I'll catch up to you.
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:52.720]   So that's not really a career ambition of mine by any means.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:09:00.200]   But when I went to Bobleheads II,
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.800]   which was the last of these meetings I've been to,
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:08.440]   and it was a long time ago now, it was 2001,
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:13.400]   I ended up writing two articles based on that experience.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.360]   One was the one some of you are probably familiar with
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:19.600]   called Here Come the Bogleheads, Victoria's Waving,
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.880]   and the other was one that I called
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:25.000]   I Don't Know and I Don't Care.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:32.040]   And in that second piece, I realized something important
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:35.080]   that I had actually learned from those of you
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:39.360]   who were with me at Bobleheads II,
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:42.960]   which is that it's one thing as an investor
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.600]   to say I don't know.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.760]   I don't know whether U.S. will outperform international.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.040]   I don't know whether value will outperform growth.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.760]   I don't know whether small will outperform large.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.760]   Or even I don't know whether active
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.280]   will outperform passive, although that I don't really think
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.040]   is an open question at this point.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.760]   But it's an entirely different matter to say,
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.360]   and I don't care.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.920]   Because not caring is hard.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.560]   Because it means you go to the barbecue
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:21.440]   and you listen to the guy who just bought Bitcoin
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.440]   and he bought it at $13 and now it's at $19,000
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.840]   and you didn't.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:34.280]   And it means that you can't watch financial television.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:39.600]   You have to be very focused, very disciplined,
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.000]   and you can't let your views be contaminated
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.480]   by what other people are saying
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.640]   or by what the market is doing.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:51.640]   And so the importance is that the two beliefs
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:55.560]   have to go together.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.400]   You have to renounce any interest
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.480]   in knowing the answer to questions
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.440]   that probably can't be answered.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:08.320]   And you have to get to the point where you don't care
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.040]   that you believe you can't know.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:16.040]   And so finding new ways to help people
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.560]   get to that resolution is sort of
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.000]   what I'm about at this point.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.480]   - Yeah, the first question is easy.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.120]   I think the thing that most everybody can do
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.040]   that will make them a better investor
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.960]   is to simply pick a simple strategy
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.480]   and then stop obsessing about it.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.200]   Maybe look at your portfolio, I don't know,
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.960]   once every five years or so.
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:42.080]   It's a proven fact that the less you look
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.160]   at your portfolio and the less you evaluate it,
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.160]   the better your returns are going to be.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:52.080]   What I'm doing is writing long-form historical nonfiction.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.600]   And one of the joys of doing that
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.240]   is you work for three years and then for six weeks
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:01.360]   you get to sit bolt upright in the middle of the night
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:05.360]   in a cold sweat wondering whether your publisher
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.680]   is going to accept the manuscript or not.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.160]   So that's where I'm at right now
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.280]   and the less I talk about it, the better.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:14.280]   (audience laughing)
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.800]   - I continue to toil on the logistics
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.560]   of retirement decumulation.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.760]   That's a key preoccupation for me
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.920]   in my work on Morningstar.com.
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.960]   Constructing model portfolios,
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.440]   not with an eye toward beating
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.720]   all other in-retirement portfolios,
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.600]   but just an eye toward showing
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.880]   what a sane in-retirement portfolio might look like
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.620]   and how you can go about extracting cashflow
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:42.120]   from that portfolio.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.080]   Not to be confused with pure income
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.960]   because I know a lot of retirees
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.840]   are very fixated on current income.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.680]   So I've been trying to showcase that
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:56.160]   and talk about that in my work.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.640]   Separately, I've been talking about
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.640]   some of the other challenges of retirees.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.640]   One of the big ones,
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.320]   and I've talked about this here before,
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.840]   is the challenge of confronting long-term care costs,
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:11.360]   which is, I think, a huge unaddressed problem
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.560]   for many middle-class to upper-middle-class households
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.080]   and retirement savers,
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.840]   people who thought they were doing all the right things
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.440]   to try to ensure a comfortable retirement.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.880]   So unfortunately, there aren't a lot of great answers
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:27.360]   in the long-term care space,
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.980]   but it's an evolving landscape,
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:31.440]   and we've been trying to talk about
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.600]   some of the new products coming online,
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.620]   the good and the bad of them,
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:40.620]   some ways to think about paying for long-term care costs,
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:43.280]   using HSA premiums, for example,
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.080]   to pay for long-term care insurance.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.920]   So I've been talking a lot about those issues
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:51.640]   and also trying to touch on the softer side
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.920]   of long-term care,
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.680]   some of the costs that it inflicts on families,
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.400]   because much of long-term care in this country
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.800]   is shouldered by unpaid family caregivers.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.640]   So trying to address that whole set of hard issues
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:11.080]   related to long-term care is another focus of mine.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:14.600]   In terms of lessons for investors,
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.200]   I think one thing I like to talk about
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.120]   is household capital allocation.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.480]   So beyond just the investment portfolio,
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.080]   thinking about your total financial life
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.560]   and looking for the best ROI,
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.840]   return on investment for you,
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.640]   it may lie outside of your investment portfolio.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.600]   So looking holistically across
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.640]   your capital allocation choice set,
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:38.360]   for a lot of us who have mortgages,
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.440]   for example, mortgage pay down
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.680]   is probably a better use of your cash
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.000]   than letting the money languish
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.840]   even in a higher yielding savings vehicle.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:49.000]   So thinking holistically about ROI,
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.080]   I think is a piece of advice
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.480]   that I would like to impart.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:58.720]   - Jack, I'm sorry you have to hear this,
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.680]   but I'm launching a market neutral fund
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:03.040]   that will short the stocks
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.480]   that Kramer says to buy and vice versa.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:08.480]   (audience laughing)
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.120]   Look, can I short that fund?
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:15.200]   (audience laughing)
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.760]   I'm having the time of my life
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.600]   and if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.560]   I'm gonna keep doing the same thing.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.320]   Jack, I'm having the time of my life
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:25.880]   because of you, because incredible advice
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.680]   that everyone including Rick Ferry
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:32.480]   at the end has given me and I'm so appreciative.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.320]   So I continue, I'm gonna write,
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.840]   I'm gonna do my hourly planning.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.560]   Rick, I couldn't be happier
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.920]   that you're going to go that route.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:45.720]   I'm doing some teaching still.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.160]   I'll chase windmills until I die,
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.640]   not as successful as Jack.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.120]   I think a lot of regulators don't do the right thing.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.840]   I would love to see financial planning
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.840]   be viewed as a profession.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.080]   I am a CFP.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:02.120]   I just wrote a piece, I believe it was last week,
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.440]   noting that the CFP spends a lot of money
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.200]   advertising the higher standard,
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.560]   but doesn't actually enforce it.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.000]   So I would really like to see
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.480]   regulators and the CFP board
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.040]   do a better job of making the industry fair.
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.920]   But it's absolutely Jack Bogle and Vanguard
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.080]   and all of you that did incredible writing
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.360]   that educated people.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.400]   We're now 44% of money in U.S. stock funds
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.840]   are in index funds.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.480]   - Alan is too modest to admit
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:39.280]   that what he really enjoys more than anything else
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:43.040]   is provoking insurance salesmen into legal threats.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.240]   (audience laughing)
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.800]   So we'd like to thank you,
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.040]   everybody who submitted a question, we appreciate it,
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.240]   but we especially thank our panel.
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.000]   Your opinions are well-respected,
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.360]   you're leaders in the investment community,
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.880]   and we appreciate what you had to say.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.520]   So let's give a round of applause to our panel,
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.080]   and we'll see you after lunch.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.240]   (audience applauding)
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.240]   (audience cheering)

[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.760]   (mouse clicking)
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:16.520]   (mouse clicking)
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.280]   (mouse clicking)
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:29.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
