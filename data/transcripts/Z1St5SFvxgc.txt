[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast and today Pastor John I want to
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.240]   talk to you about your recent funeral prayer that you recently delivered on
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.880]   behalf of the Powell's family, a family of five planning and preparing to become
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.800]   missionaries to Japan who were tragically killed in an automobile
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.200]   accident this summer. You were asked to pray at the funeral and that public
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.480]   lament which we published in this podcast has now exceeded 700,000 plays
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.400]   to date which is at least three times more plays than any of the other 900
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.200]   plus episodes we've published in this podcast. It's been amazingly well
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.320]   received and I think even in the light of the tragedy that called for it, it
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.360]   would be beneficial to pastors and leaders to all of us to hear from you on
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.040]   how you made it. So can you take us into it, what is it, what did you intend to
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.760]   accomplish and and how did you write it? Tony the first thing I think we need to
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.960]   be completely honest about is my misgivings about whether prayers should
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.520]   even be broadcast on the internet and whether you and I right now should be
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.600]   talking about this. Of course the very fact that I am talking about it and
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.840]   didn't pull the plug on this and that we did make the prayer available at
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.200]   Desiring God and that I used Twitter to link to the whole service over at the
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.440]   Bethlehem Hope in God website shows that my conclusion from those misgivings was
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.480]   that more good would be done by sharing it than by not. But there are at least
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.960]   two reasons that give me pause and I think they would be helpful to mention
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.720]   here. One is that Jesus said hypocrites love to stand and pray in the synagogues
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:59.040]   and on the street corners that they may be seen by others. That's a really
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.360]   important thing for me, the prayer to hear. The other is that we're dealing
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.880]   here with real families and real relationships and real pain and real
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:21.800]   loss. It's very fresh even now, and the thought of somehow for us, you and me
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.240]   and Desiring God, the thought that we would exploit that moment and that pain
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:38.360]   to put ourselves forward would be absolutely loathsome in the eyes of God.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:48.520]   So God abominates that kind of spiritual prostitution. So as I stand before God
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:56.720]   in prayer, I have to look him in the eye, as it were, and let him search my heart
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.580]   as to whether the very praying of a prayer, let alone the publishing of a
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:13.560]   prayer, were more about me than about him and those who suffer. And the reason
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.200]   mentioning this struggle is part of the answer to your question of where the
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.120]   prayer came from is that every pastor has to ask this question when he prays
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.560]   in public, which ought to be pretty much every week. The Bible endorses and
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.240]   encourages public praying. 1st Corinthians 14 16. We want people to
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.920]   hear and say "Amen" to what we pray. That's what that verse says.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.320]   Christian leaders are to lead their people in prayer publicly, out loud, not
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.120]   just in a closet. And everyone who prays in public, whether in a group of six or
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.280]   six hundred or six thousand, must face the question of selfish motivation. It's
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.760]   not unique to me or to desiring God or to a funeral. It's every time anyone
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.320]   opens his mouth in the presence of two or three people. That's an issue of
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.080]   hypocrisy on the line and authenticity on the line. So the first thing to say
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.200]   about where this prayer came from is that it came from a sense of utter
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:37.240]   inadequacy. First, because the disproportion between the deaths of two
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.920]   parents and three children—the disproportion between those five deaths
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:51.600]   in one horrific conflagration, on the one hand, and the sufficiency of
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:59.880]   words—words, words, words—to embody or somehow represent the magnitude of what
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:08.760]   just happened, that disproportion seemed to me utterly mammoth, insurmountable.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:16.200]   There's no way that words could do justice to the reality of what had just
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.840]   happened. That was the first sense of inadequacy, and it's true. It's not just
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:30.040]   like I've got an inadequate feeling here. It's true. Words cannot, cannot capture
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:37.000]   the breadth and depth of what these families were and are, even as we speak,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.480]   experiencing. So what's a pastor to do? What's a friend to do? The second sense
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:52.480]   of inadequacy was that I knew I would be standing before a thousand real
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:00.120]   live people. This was the biggest service we've ever had in my 33 years plus in
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.920]   relation to Bethlehem. I knew that I would be standing in front of a thousand
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:15.440]   people plus, real live bodies, and how does a fallen, sinful pastor pray to God?
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.680]   To God, not to people, to God, really to God, when he knows that a thousand people
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:30.280]   are listening to see what he says? And again, I know that the Bible says when we
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.360]   pray publicly we should care about what other people hear us saying. 1
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.000]   Corinthians 14, 16. We should care. A pastor shouldn't say, "I don't care who's
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.360]   listening. I'm just praying to an audience of one." Baloney! Baloney! We know
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.960]   people are listening, and the Bible says we must care, lest they cannot say
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.240]   "Amen." The Bible gives explicit instruction to care about whether or not
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:01.400]   the people who are listening get it. So it's a supernatural work of God. It's a
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:09.240]   miracle if a pastor can really speak to God—that is, authentically pray,
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:16.360]   authentically intercede, authentically lament and praise and plead rather than
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.880]   performing for human audience. That's a miracle. It's a work of the Spirit. So
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:29.840]   behind this prayer was at least that double sense of inadequacy. One, without a
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:38.400]   miracle, the words I choose will seem all out of proportion in their weakness to
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.400]   the magnitude of what has just happened. And number two, without a miracle, I'm
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:51.480]   gonna be grandstanding instead of praying. So inside that double sense of
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:57.160]   inadequacy, as I've thought about it and felt it, I had three goals that might
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:06.040]   help pastors or whoever deal with how you put together a prayer in public in
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:13.080]   such a situation. And my three goals were, number one, to make much of the imperial
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:21.600]   majesty of Jesus Christ for whom this family gave their lives. Number two, to
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:29.400]   give some evidence by what I said and how I said it of the incalculable weight
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:37.280]   and loss and the intensity and the depth of the pain. Number three, to plead with
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:44.440]   God for the comfort and the strength and the hope and even the joy of those who
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:51.040]   remain. And to do that, to do those three things, I was guided by four convictions.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:57.360]   Number one, since all words are inadequate to represent the magnitude of
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.400]   what had happened, the safest thing was to use as much biblical language as I
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:10.920]   could. I do believe deeply that the Bible encourages us to formulate word pictures,
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:17.840]   images, metaphors, similes, because this kind of poetic talk, which is pervasive
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:24.600]   in the Bible, this kind of talk comes closer to capturing the emotions of the
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:31.000]   moment than ordinary prosaic descriptions. So I reached for
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.840]   biblical images, and oh, the danger here. There's dangers everywhere. Every effort to
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.900]   express something with images runs the risk of drawing more attention to the
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:51.240]   language than to the reality we're trying to make plain with the language.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:57.560]   Every person who speaks or writes or sings about anything that really matters
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:03.760]   has to come to terms with this danger and do their best to say things in a way
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:11.800]   that will help people see through the window rather than staring at the glass.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:19.200]   That's the challenge of choosing words. Second, my second conviction
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:27.040]   that was guiding me, there is real biblical lament before the face of God
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:37.620]   that tells him how much he has hurt us without feeling anger at him. That's a
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:45.660]   deep conviction of mine. I do not believe it is ever, ever, ever, ever right to be
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:54.660]   angry at God. Ever. I disapprove strongly of making our anger at God a part of
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:11:01.700]   public worship. Public prayers are to represent what ought to be. Now, of course
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:07.540]   people get angry at God. Good grief. Of course they do. Christians get angry at
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:13.780]   God. They shouldn't, but they do. And if they do get angry at God, they should
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:21.100]   tell him so. There's no point in adding the sin of fearful hypocrisy as if you
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.660]   could hide anything. There's no point in adding the sin of fearful
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.540]   hypocrisy to the sin of Godward anger. God can handle our anger if we get
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:37.300]   angry, and there's no hiding it from him. He sees it before we know we're even
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:49.940]   feeling it. But anger at God is not godly lament. Godly lament says, "You have driven
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:56.700]   your arrows into my breast." Godly lament says, "You have filled my mouth with
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:04.620]   gravel." Godly lament says, "You have covered me with shadows, and I grope for
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:10.060]   substance of real bodies that have been taken away from me." Godly lament always
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:18.380]   says, "Nevertheless, to you, O God, I look for my deliverance. To you alone, I look
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:27.340]   for my hope. You alone are my portion." I wanted to express godly biblical lament,
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:34.540]   not anger, at the all-wise, all-good, all-powerful God. Now, whether I succeeded
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:40.620]   or not, others will judge, but that was a guiding conviction. My third conviction
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:48.340]   was that in order to pray for the comfort of the grieving, you need to try
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:54.740]   to get inside the skin of the particular people and relationships in front of you.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:13:03.620]   So I tried. I took about five hours trying. I tried to crawl inside the minds
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:10.340]   of parents, grandparents, and brothers, and sisters, and little children, cousins, in
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:15.580]   the minds of hundreds of friends, and even strangers who I knew would care
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:20.860]   about this, given the news media, and the truck driver. I wanted to get inside his
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:30.820]   mind. Whether or not a pastor succeeds in this depends partly on the measure
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.020]   of his own life experience. It's hard, if you've never walked through anything
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.900]   horrible, to get inside the skin of those who've experienced something horrible,
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.940]   which is why pastors should never begrudge their own suffering. God knows
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:49.340]   what he's doing in creating shepherds that can empathize with sheep. And it
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:56.420]   depends on the Spirit-given powers of imagination to put yourself in someone
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.780]   else's shoes, because you never really are in their exact situation. There's
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.780]   something unique about every suffering, and you can't be in it all, but you can
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:11.260]   plead with the Holy Spirit for the miracle to try to get into the head and
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.780]   the heart of those who are suffering. That was the third, and here's my
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:23.680]   last, guiding conviction, was that Jesus Christ is the Lord of the Universe. He is
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.620]   absolutely sovereign over all things. Nothing happens that is outside his
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:35.820]   ultimate control. He is unimpeachable in his character. He is good and holy, and
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:44.820]   his disposition toward his beloved is totally, totally merciful. Therefore, I did
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:50.420]   not want in any way to portray him as weak or ignorant or helpless or
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:57.140]   perplexed or outmaneuvered by Satan or any less capable of triumph in Japan
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:04.980]   because of this loss. I wanted to portray him this way not only because he is this
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:13.380]   way, but because Jameson and Catherine believed he was this way and would want
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:20.300]   me to say that. So Tony, there are a lot of wrestlings that went into the
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:25.500]   preparations of prayer, but that's perhaps enough for now. There's so much
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.660]   more, so much more that pastors and lovers of people who pray out loud
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:35.580]   have to get, but that may give a flavor to those who might find it helpful.
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.700]   I'd say so. Thank you, Pastor John, for walking us through this prayer and for
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.020]   all these wrestlings behind it and for explaining your convictions and your own
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.980]   personal fears in this tragic moment. This remains a unique teaching moment
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.060]   for all of us on so many levels, even down to thinking through a theology of
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.940]   lament. Of course, you can hear the prayer itself, which was released in an episode
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:03.260]   titled "John Piper's Funeral Prayer for a Family of Five," which was delivered and
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:08.820]   released back on August 6th. To find that recording or for more details about

[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.780]   Should we meet in buildings or should we meet in homes? John Piper will help us
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.900]   work through the questions. I'm your host, Tony Ranke. Thanks for listening to the
