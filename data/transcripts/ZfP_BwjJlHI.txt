[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]   So that's what we're going to do today.
[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.360]   Our deep question, we're going to explore.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.120]   What are the best ideas from other productivity authors?
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.400]   All right, let's get started.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.580]   Uh, I'm going to bring up pictures of these books on the screen.
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.720]   So if you're just listening to this, you can find the video at the deep life.com.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.320]   This is episode two 65.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.460]   The videos are linked at the bottom.
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.660]   All right.
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.720]   So the first book I have on the screen right now, the, uh, the OG, the goat
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.000]   of the productivity boat book space.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.820]   That is Stephen Covey's the seven habits of highly effective people.
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:44.300]   A very important book in the space also led to, I don't know, five or six years
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.120]   of everyone having numbers in their titles.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.860]   So I don't know if that's a good legacy or a bad legacy.
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.780]   I think we've gotten past that now, but for a while, uh, after the seven habits
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.060]   came out, there were so many books that had the eight habits of this, the six
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.300]   habits of this, the nine laws for this, we've sort of moved past that,
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.740]   but that was a trend it started.
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.160]   All right.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.420]   This book is a little bit older.
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.460]   Uh, it's an incredibly influential book.
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.740]   It has sold millions upon millions of copies.
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.180]   I read this when I was in high school.
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.420]   So it was very influential on me for a long period of time.
[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.300]   So what's the big idea I want to pull out of this book.
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.580]   Start with the end in mind.
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.860]   All right.
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.540]   So this is a key notion from Covey, which is productivity for productivity
[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.100]   sake is meaningless.
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.380]   Why are you being more organized?
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.960]   Why are you keeping better track of things?
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.100]   You need to figure out what it is you are trying to do with your life, with
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.740]   your work in your role as a parent, in your role as a community leader, and
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.820]   all the productivity should be working backwards to support that vision.
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:51.400]   So it instrumentalizes productivity towards much more philosophically
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.700]   or spiritually important goals.
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.900]   That is a very influential idea, not just for me, but for anyone who's
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.500]   writing in the sustainable productivity or the, uh, the sustainable productivity
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.020]   or the humanist productivity tradition.
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.980]   A lot of that goes back to Stephen Covey and seven habits of highly effective.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.380]   So if you know what you're trying to do, then you can care about, Oh, this is why
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.540]   I'm organizing my calendar and keeping track of my tasks and making sure that
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.540]   I'm balancing the important, but non-urgent work with the non-important, but urgent
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.100]   tasks that are pulling for my attention.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.500]   All of these really good on the ground, tactical productivity ideas that come
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.980]   out of this book are all aimed towards big picture goals.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.700]   What am I trying to do in these different parts of my life?
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.540]   Obviously this resonates with how we talk about productivity on the show.
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.260]   It resonates with the notion of the deep life.
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.380]   It resonates with lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.220]   Covey's shadow looms large in a lot of what we talk about here.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.260]   So that's an important book.
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.300]   Don't be turned off by the number in the title.
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.660]   This is actually a much deeper book than you might be
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.820]   thinking if you've never read it.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.820]   All right.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.380]   Book number two, another classic from the genre, David
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.740]   Allen's Getting Things Done.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.820]   Now people think about getting things done.
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.140]   People who don't know the book often caricature what they think
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.340]   it's about because of the title.
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.140]   So those who are writing in the more recent anti-productivity camp often
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.980]   see that title and say, well, this, this book is part of a whole industry
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.100]   that valorizes getting as much things done as possible, that getting
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.380]   things done is all that matters.
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.500]   That accomplishing more tasks off your list is what matters.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.900]   And, and it's part of this productivity, Protestant work ethic complex that just
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.060]   tries to push us to do more and more.
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.460]   But David Allen's book is way more complicated and interesting than that.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.620]   I actually wrote a whole long form New Yorker piece about this a few years
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.060]   ago called The Rise and Fall of Getting Things Done, and it's about David
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.220]   Allen and it's about Merlin Mann and it's about the evolution of the productivity
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.580]   industry, and it's a cool article and it's a rich topic.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.700]   Now your first hint, if you've never read this book, your first hint that
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.020]   there's more going on here than someone just saying, do more work is the subtitle.
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:23.820]   Look at the subtitle of this book, The Art of Stress-Free Productivity.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.740]   Stress-free and art are in the subtitle.
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.580]   This is not what you would expect from a book that's about
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.860]   how to crush your task list.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.340]   So what's really going on?
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.260]   Well, if you read this book, you see what Allen cares about is
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.580]   psychological sustainability.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.100]   His concern is as you get more and more to do, which by the way, he just posits
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.900]   as an unfortunate reality of modern work, not as a goal that you're pursuing.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.620]   He says, this is the unfortunate reality of work is the nineties give way to the
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.540]   two thousands is that we have more and more to do, and this is very stressful.
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.740]   And I want to find a way to make this unavoidable reality
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.460]   of modern work less stressful.
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.460]   How do we get more psychological sustainability from a world of work
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.700]   that demands a to-do list that are 50 things long, email inboxes that are
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.220]   clogged, inbox trays that are overfilling.
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.740]   So he's not pushing.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.620]   It's good to do more work.
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.620]   He says, how in the world can we survive that reality?
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.820]   How do we present prevent that from being too stressful?
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.820]   So one of the big ideas from his book, the idea I want to isolate here is
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.980]   that open loops generate stress.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.620]   So open loop is his term for some sort of obligation or commitment that you've
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.580]   made that is not captured somewhere that you can trust it's an obligation or
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.060]   commitment that you're really just keeping track of in your mind.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.540]   Alan is pointing out that as a major source of stress and anxiety in work.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.580]   If you answer an email and say, yeah, I'll work on that project.
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.620]   And you're not really keeping track of that anywhere else, but in your brain,
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.780]   it's going to use up brain resources and be this little engine that generates a
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.220]   little background thrum of anxiety.
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.900]   And if you have 50 or 60 things that you're sort of supposed to be working on,
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.300]   or you said you've been working on and you don't have it written down anywhere,
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.260]   or you've written it down somewhere that you don't trust, you're going to look
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.060]   each one of those things, each one of those, what he calls open loops, little
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.300]   engine of anxiety going in your brain.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.820]   And it all adds up.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.140]   And that's what stresses us out.
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.620]   And that's what makes work psychologically unsustainable.
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.940]   So the entire program and getting things done is full capture.
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.100]   How do you have a single trusted system?
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.900]   Where once something gets written in it, you do not have to think about it.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.300]   You know, you will see it there in that system.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.020]   When the time comes, how do you build a system like this and make sure that
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.740]   everything that you've committed to be it implicitly or explicitly, let it,
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.900]   whether it be very large or whether it's just, Hey, call back and give me this
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.020]   information, how do you make sure that everything you've committed to is in that
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.380]   system?
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.580]   So your brain can just be free of trying to remember it free of the stress of
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.220]   forgetting and just focus on whatever you're doing right now.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.140]   Now, does this actually work?
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.180]   Well, it, there's some issues.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.380]   I mean, Alan was working on this just as email and the hyperactive hive
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.540]   mind was getting out of control.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.700]   So the book is really right.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.860]   Pre that period.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.700]   I think the, the, the world of checking an inbox once every five to six minutes.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.300]   Makes the getting things done methodology not so cleanly apply.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.780]   It's a, people now use their inbox to keep track of things.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.460]   There's much more interruption and distraction when you have to
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.500]   keep checking these inboxes.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.820]   So it's not a panacea for our modern world, but I think the key about this
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.460]   is that he's trying to reduce stress.
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.140]   And the way he's trying to reduce stress is recognizing that keeping things
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.340]   track of things in your mind is one of the biggest sources of this bad feeling.
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.060]   So don't do that.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.580]   Have good systems, have full capture.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.020]   So that's the big idea from Alan misunderstood.
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.100]   I think when you really understand them, you see he's much more on the side of
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.220]   humanist productivity than he is the straw man that the anti productivity
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.900]   camps often make him out to be.
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.900]   When you Google his book, your article is one of the first things that comes up.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.220]   Oh, there we go.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.740]   If you Google getting things done.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.140]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:07.740]   Oh, there we go.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.340]   Deep work and getting things done.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:17.020]   We're often in competition for top spot on Amazon's, I guess, time management list.
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:22.580]   So the books that live at the top of that list are deep work, getting things done,
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:28.020]   the four hour work week, uh, and essentialism, which will also two
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:28.860]   other books we'll talk about.
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:29.420]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.460]   So we're all, we're all in the mix up there.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.580]   All right.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:38.580]   Let's, uh, speaking of these, let's go to book three, Tim Ferris, the four
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:43.020]   hour work week, escape the nine to five, live anywhere and join the new rich.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.740]   This book came out in 2007.
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.700]   I remember this book coming out because my mutual friend with Tim.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.180]   So Tim and I shared a mutual friend of Ramit Sethi.
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:57.260]   And I remember in 2007, Ramit saying, Hey, Cal, you got to read this book.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.740]   This friend of mine, Tim has, it's a crazy, he's done some crazy things.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.940]   This book is really going to blow up.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.580]   You got to read this.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.180]   And I listened to it on audio.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.020]   I remember for all of those sort of Cambridge people out there, I was
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.620]   living near a Huron village in Cambridge, outside of Boston.
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.700]   And I remember listening to this walking on Porter street towards Porter square.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.300]   I don't know why I have this memory.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.380]   I just do to go to the Brugger bagels near Porter square, listening
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.340]   to the four hour work week.
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.620]   It's just this really clear memory that I have.
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.980]   A very influential book.
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.260]   I also wrote a New Yorker article about this.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.260]   There's a good piece from a couple of years ago where I interviewed Tim.
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.900]   And I interviewed him about where the book came from and what the reaction
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.100]   was like when the book came out.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:46.540]   This is also a book that I think has been overlooked in recent years.
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.460]   I don't really know why this was one of the questions I asked in that New Yorker
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.380]   piece, what Tim was talking about in 2007 is actually super relevant to what
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.580]   people were talking about in 2021 and 2022, when they were thinking about
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.460]   post pandemic, rethinking their lives and the role of work in their lives and
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.220]   where they live and what they do and what their life is like, and everyone
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.180]   was rediscovering this idea of there's more to life than just work.
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.380]   And Tim had written the definitive book on this and wasn't a part of the
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.460]   conversation, but should have been.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.100]   So what's the core idea I want to point out from the four hour work week.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:28.500]   It's the notion that work is a tool to use in implementing an ideal lifestyle.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.700]   This was very influential to me because Tim basically separated
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.620]   your ideal lifestyle from work.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.300]   So you figure out what you want to do.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.820]   He called them mini retirements.
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.700]   You know, he had all these examples in his book of people in their
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.940]   twenties that would live in Argentina and take tango lessons and rent
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.300]   a helicopter to go up and drink some Malbec up in the mountains.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.100]   These really sort of a, of amazing things that like people in their
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:55.980]   twenties would really care about.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.620]   You're like, look, there's these cool lifestyles.
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.220]   Work is just about funding that.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.380]   And once you know that, then you can start to get pretty clever and say,
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.540]   well, how much money do I need?
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.300]   Well, I can reduce that amount if I live overseas in a place
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.540]   where the dollar is stronger.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.740]   And he goes into all of these, these systems for, uh, automating your work
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:16.260]   and simplifying your work and basically creating little money engines, not
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.500]   things that are going to make you rich.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.580]   But things that would generate enough money that you could do tango in
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.500]   Argentina, and he called that lifestyle design.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.860]   Now, I think he got dismissed in part because the specific examples he gave
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:34.500]   were the examples that again, a 28 year old in 2006 would be thinking about.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.300]   But the broader point underneath this book, I think is much more general.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.220]   And much more impactful, which is this idea that it's the
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.700]   lifestyle ultimately that matters.
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.660]   Work is something that supports that.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.700]   And it might support it by just being a money source.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.460]   And you want to minimize its footprint as much as possible, or it might
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.020]   support it much more substantially.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.620]   Like what you're doing with your work, uh, helps put into your life,
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.660]   specific things that you like, or lets you live in a place you really like,
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.860]   but you have to see it instrumentally.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.140]   And again, this was really different than the way that people were seeing careers
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.340]   in the period leading up to this book.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.780]   The first decade of the two thousands, this was the rise of passion culture.
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.300]   It was the peak of passion culture.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.420]   It was the peak of this idea that the.
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.620]   Secret to happiness was following your passion with your career only
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.060]   through matching your job to what you loved, could you find passion?
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.300]   And Tim said, forget that.
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.660]   The things that you're going to make your life happy might have
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.860]   very little to do with work, but you know what, in this new world
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.900]   of technology and internet, you could probably find ways to make enough
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.220]   money if you're a smart person and have some advantages, you can make enough
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.460]   money to go do things cool right now.
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.740]   I think it's a really influential idea.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.460]   Uh, definitely an influence on me.
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.980]   I think you see that in lifestyle centric career planning work
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.020]   backwards from the lifestyle.
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.580]   I think you see it in my deep lifestyle thinking work is in there, but it's in
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.460]   there along with other sorts of things that you're all deploying towards the
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.180]   vision of making your life deeper.
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.740]   The four hour work week is an influential book.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:08.740]   And I mean, really think it helped kick off this notion of work to live as
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.260]   opposed to live to work that's really kind of dominant right now in our
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.020]   discourse about productivity and happiness.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.140]   All right.
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.220]   Book number four, bring it up on the screen here.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:23.540]   This is Greg McEwen's essentialism.
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:29.460]   Uh, this book came out a couple of years before deep work, very
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.540]   popular book, very influential.
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.220]   Uh, I know Greg, uh, I think Greg may have been on this podcast
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.100]   way back in the early days.
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.620]   I've certainly been on Greg's podcast.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.540]   I, you know, I, the early days of this podcast are hazy, but he's a friend of
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:46.860]   mine, I like to think of him as a friend of the show, so essentialism.
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:53.060]   What's the, the idea I want to isolate there saying no can make you more valuable.
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.700]   So the whole book about essentialism is about doing less things.
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.340]   We do too much in work and we should do less things at work and why you
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.300]   should do that and how to do that.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.660]   But there was a story in there that really stuck with me.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.460]   And the story was of a, an employee that was overwhelmed.
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.180]   I forget exactly what industry is in some sort of management
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.380]   consultancy type thing, really overwhelmed with work.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.060]   And so he hatched this plan of, you know what I'm going to do?
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.460]   I'm going to partially retire.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.180]   Uh, maybe I'm just gonna do some consulting on the side.
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.820]   I can make this work financially.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.860]   So he knew he was going to leave the job.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.580]   So he said, why not before I actually leave the job, why
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.140]   don't I launch an experiment?
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.860]   What if I just say no to most things?
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.780]   Because this was his big problem is that all these different bosses and
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.980]   colleagues were always throwing stuff on his plate and he thought the way to
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.980]   get ahead was to be agreeable and say yes to everything, be the person that
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.780]   could count on to I'll take what you want me to do and I'll get it done.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.300]   And it was really exhausting him.
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.100]   That's why he was going to quit.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.540]   He's like, well, what if I just, before I quit, I just said no to most things.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.460]   It just kept my focus on the really most important projects.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.500]   It's like, Hey, I'll probably get yelled at, but I was going to leave anyway.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.060]   So why not?
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.340]   He tries this experiment.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.980]   And what happens?
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.140]   He gets promoted.
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:07.620]   He starts saying no to more things and he gets promoted.
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.380]   Why?
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.820]   Because when you say no, in the moment, of course, there's a little
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.580]   bit of a social uncomfortableness.
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.100]   But no one's tallying that up somewhere, your score of social
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.420]   uncomfortableness and how high is that getting, what do they notice is the
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.740]   work that you're actually completing.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.740]   And by being able to focus on a smaller number of things and do those things
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:31.180]   better, he began to gain more attention for the great stuff he was producing.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.420]   And that was way more valuable than him saying yes in the moment.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.780]   So he didn't end up needing to leave his job.
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.420]   He fixed his overload problem by just saying no.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.540]   And instead of it being something that he had to figure out, how can I get
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.820]   my employer to tolerate me doing less?
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:50.340]   It turned out that his employer celebrated him after he started doing less.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.820]   Now that's not always possible, right?
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.620]   Different jobs have different social dynamics and power hierarchies.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:00.740]   But I think this core idea that doing fewer things better can produce more
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.940]   value for you and your employer than doing lots of things mediocre is very
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:10.620]   influential, it not only justifies the whole program of essentialism that
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:15.500]   McEwen talks about, it became a core plank of slow productivity, the first
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.460]   principle of slow productivity, which says do fewer things.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.980]   This is not just about, I want to be less stressed.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.140]   It actually can be a strategy for being better at what you do, whether you work
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.940]   in a big company or just handling clients on your own.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.180]   So essentialism did really well.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.700]   And I think in part, people recognize overload was an issue.
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.940]   And there was some optimism in this idea that doing less is not just a survival
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.380]   move, it might actually be a move towards advancement.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.780]   All right, let's roll along here to a more recent book.
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:56.540]   So one's by my friend Oliver Berkman, 4000 Weeks Time Management for Mortals.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.860]   This came out in 2021, did very well in both the UK where Berkman's from and
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.700]   here in the US, the book did very well.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:09.220]   I like to take a small amount of credit for that because I helped convince Tim
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.980]   Ferris that you would like this book and he did, and then he had Berkman on his
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:18.220]   show and having Berkman, it'd be on the Ferris show, pushing a book that Ferris
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.220]   likes, helps you sell books.
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.020]   I don't know if you know about that, but that does pretty well.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.100]   Anyways, this book did really well.
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:32.860]   It really hit a chord for what we think of as a sort of an exhausted in phase
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.460]   pandemic audience of people who were just burnt out from work and Zoom.
[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.260]   And this book hit a really good chord.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.460]   All right, so what's the big idea I want to pull out of 4000 Weeks?
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.260]   Accepting you don't have time to do most things.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:52.660]   Accepting you don't have time to do most things that you want to
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.220]   do can help you chill out now.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.460]   All right, so let me say that better.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.540]   Accepting that you don't have enough time to do most things can
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.300]   help you be more relaxed right now.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.060]   Oliver does a better job explaining this to me, but what I'm getting at here is
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:09.220]   that basically the core of this book is this notion that you're only going to
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.980]   live on average about 4000 weeks.
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.140]   That's not that much time.
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.220]   So most things that you could do, you're not going to do.
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.540]   So instead of obsessing about the border of like, well, what if I could
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.940]   have done this and I did in this?
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:24.140]   Enjoy the things that you are doing and be okay with you're not doing most.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.740]   If you can't get close to doing any anywhere near the whole list of
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.500]   possibilities, you're saying no to most things anyways, why stress out about
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.500]   that small border of things that maybe you could squeeze in, but you didn't.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.420]   What if you just didn't squeeze in the extra thing and said, I'm okay with this.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.540]   I like what's going on with my work.
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.100]   I it's sustainable right now.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.340]   I like the people I work with.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.180]   It's flexible.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.020]   Uh, I like what I'm doing.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:48.500]   That's good.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.940]   I have like one hobby.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.460]   This is, I like this hobby I work on and sometimes I don't.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.700]   And the sunset's nice.
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.220]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:00.620]   It's, it's a, a push towards more of a present, a focus on presence, a
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:07.300]   focus on savoring what you do have a focus on, uh, accomplishing more things.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.580]   Making that list longer.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.500]   Is it necessarily going to make me much happier, but it could create a lot of
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.740]   unnecessary stress or self-recrimination.
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.620]   So it was a call to slow down.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.140]   To be happy with what you did have.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.900]   A lot of people were feeling this coming out of the pandemic.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.140]   So I think this book hit the, uh, the culture at a really good time.
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.420]   They weren't looking to add more to their list.
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.380]   They're looking to simplify and be okay with that simplification.
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.180]   Again, it's a big idea, uh, influential on my slow productivity philosophy as well.
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:41.380]   Doing less things, keeping the pace natural, try and do those things really
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:46.420]   well, but being okay with it, taking a lot of time, that's a very congruent
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.220]   with an Oliver Berkman, 4,000 weeks.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.500]   Style mindset.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:50.780]   All right.
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:51.660]   Moving on.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.980]   Six book.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.140]   I want to talk about here is Jenny Odell's how to do nothing.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.580]   All right.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.380]   This is a book that came out the week.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.060]   I think the same week as my book, digital minimalism.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.860]   So there's a period there.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.380]   These books were seen kind of as being in similar, a similar category.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.300]   So we, we did some things together.
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.580]   The books were reviewed together.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:18.180]   Often the New Yorker had a Gia Tolentino piece that co-reviewed my book and
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.940]   Jenny's the New York times book review did something that, that had my book and
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.220]   Jenny.
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.100]   So we were, we were sort of intertwined there for a while because we were both
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.740]   dealing in part with distraction and the attention economy.
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.740]   Uh, this book was very successful.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:34.900]   New York times bestseller, Barack Obama put it on his list of recommended books,
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.980]   his reading list for 2019.
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.740]   So it's, it's a good book.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.700]   It's a, it's a deep book.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.820]   It's a complicated book.
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:47.580]   It has more of a foundation in, uh, actual academic thinking than a lot of other
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.500]   books in this space.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.900]   There there's a particular Italian Marxist philosopher, the Jenny's very
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.660]   influenced by.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:58.300]   And so you have a particular academic lineage from this particular, uh,
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:03.180]   Italian Marxist that, that is being updated to apply to the social media age
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:03.620]   by Jenny.
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.540]   So this is, it's more academic than a lot of books in this space, which I think
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.020]   is part of part of its appeal.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:13.660]   But the idea I want to pull out of this now, which I think was important is the
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:19.940]   notion that the attention economies monetization of our attention led us to
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.180]   increasingly monetize our own time.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:28.180]   So what Jenny is trying to say here is, uh, the attention economy.
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.740]   So these apps that want you to look at their apps on the phone for clear
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:37.980]   capitalist reasons, see your moments of attention as a resource to commodify and
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.420]   sell.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:38.660]   Okay.
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:42.740]   So we know this tick tock wants you to spend more time looking at tick tock
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.700]   because it can package up your attention and the data describing that attention
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.140]   and sell it.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.980]   Same for Instagram, same for Twitter.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.980]   What Jenny is saying, okay, this influences the way that we then begin to
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.140]   personally think about time.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:22:00.380]   We're so used to this notion that we've been trained by these economic forces,
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.460]   this economic reality, we've been trained to think about moments as something that
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.180]   can be transformed into something that someone's going to value.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.460]   It becomes hard then to just exist and be present in a moment.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.860]   We could be monetizing this.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.700]   I could be documenting this and putting this on Instagram where it could get
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.180]   likes.
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.900]   So even though we don't directly participate in the monetization of our
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:25.060]   attention, Instagram is not sending us a check for the amount of eyeball minutes
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.940]   that are video captured.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.020]   We still adopt this mindset of time is something to be commodified.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:36.660]   Time is something to be productively transformed into attention, into
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.700]   something that is valued by someone else.
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:43.420]   And she says in that mindset shift, we lost a lot of our humanity.
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:48.340]   And so what was her suggestion, her recourse to this reality was do nothing.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.340]   Relearn how to do nothing.
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:55.380]   Relearn how to just be in a field watching birds.
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.220]   So Odell is an amateur ornithologist.
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.740]   She likes looking at birds for no other reason than it's just, this is, I just
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.660]   like to see this bird and it's peaceful out here.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.860]   And isn't that nice?
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:10.020]   That she says it's become an act of resistance, a political
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.380]   resistance to do nothing.
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.500]   To go do something just for the enjoyment of doing this with no
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.340]   documentation, no mindset towards the monetization of this moment, capturing
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.980]   attention, trying to document it for others.
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.300]   I think this really hit a chord as well.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.820]   In 2019, we had reached this peak of new dissatisfaction with the social media
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.220]   age and her message was, was just right.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.620]   Because she was, she was given a complicated critique for why
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.700]   we feel the way we feel.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.660]   There's a really cool idea.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.020]   I like it.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.300]   Doing nothing as an act of resistance.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.660]   And even when you strip off the sort of Marxist anti-capitalist
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.820]   framework of thinking here, there's a deeper truth that I think most
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:52.500]   people recognize, which is that there is a deep satisfaction in an experience
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.020]   that's had just for the experience.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.860]   We know this.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.260]   This has been intertwined into both secular and Eastern philosophical
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.580]   traditions for a long time.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.620]   However, we want to explain why this is true.
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:09.180]   We derive great satisfaction out of being able to just spend a moment,
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.220]   just being there in that moment.
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:16.660]   So Adele, I think, uh, gives nice support to that timeless claim.
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.100]   All right.
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:18.740]   I got two more here.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.020]   Speaking of timeless claim, uh, here's another book I really liked.
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.380]   It's called make time how to focus on what matters every day.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.420]   This is by Jake Knapp and John.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.140]   So Rasky, uh, they're from Google.
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.300]   And what they had done over at Google, if I understand the backstory, right.
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.620]   Is that they had taken this sprint methodology.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.740]   That's very popular in software development.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:45.500]   You say to a small number of programmers work on adding this feature for the next
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.900]   few days and do nothing else, and then let us know when you're done.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.020]   And over at Google, they had adapted this to other types of work, not just programming.
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.340]   Let's just work on one thing as a group and just do that without
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.780]   distraction until it's done and make time.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.620]   They then are generalizing this idea into personal productivity.
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:07.340]   How to you, you spread this idea into your own personal productivity practices.
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:11.060]   The key piece of that I want to pull out is the following design your
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.740]   days around focusing on what matters.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.380]   Most the rest will work itself out.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.060]   I think that's a key idea.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.340]   Prioritize.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.220]   I want to work on this thing that really matters.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.500]   And maybe that means for a few hours every day, or maybe, uh, I put
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.220]   aside an entire day and do nothing but work on this thing that matters.
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.260]   And that can make you uncomfortable because of the emails you're missing
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.660]   and the task you could be crossing off your list, but Jake and John say,
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.700]   this is what's going to, this is the engine of your success.
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.780]   It's a really important stuff getting done.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.860]   Well, everything else will work out.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.180]   It'll work out.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.140]   People won't notice they'll forget, but if you accomplished a core thing,
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.500]   you're supposed to do well, everything else will follow.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.500]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.140]   It's one that of course I preach in deep work.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.060]   It's one I preach in my new book on slow productivity.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.660]   And I think Jake and John have a lot of great examples to back it up.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.140]   All right.
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.700]   One more book, one more idea.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:06.420]   Final book comes from our friend, Laura Vanderkam, her personal
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.100]   productivity, classic 168 hours.
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.780]   That's the number of hours in a typical week.
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.860]   You have more time than you think.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.460]   That's the subtitle kind of interesting.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:21.220]   Tension with Oliver Berkman's 4,000 weeks.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.980]   It's all about, you don't have that much time.
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.780]   So stop trying to do too much.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.500]   And Laura's is you have more time than you think it's because
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.780]   we're operating on different scales.
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.540]   Here's the core idea from Laura's book.
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.620]   The core idea I want to, I want to pull out here.
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.100]   You're not working as much as you think.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:40.420]   Your sense of overload comes from what you're doing with your work hours.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.060]   This was the big surprising point from Laura's book is that she had a lot of
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.180]   people actually keep track of their time.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.980]   She calls it the time diary method.
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.860]   People actually keep track of what did I do with every hour of my day.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.740]   And then she went back and she studied these time diary logs.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:01.220]   What she saw was there's often a big disconnect between how busy people
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.620]   think they are and how much work they're actually doing.
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.420]   So you'll ask someone, well, how much are you working?
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.660]   And they're like, look, I gotta be doing 60, 70 hour weeks.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.100]   And you look at the time diary and say, well, no, you're
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.700]   working 35 to 40 hour weeks.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.100]   Now, what do we take away from that?
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.260]   Well, we could just say, ah, suck it up.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.100]   You're not really that busy, but no, the real message to take away from that is
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.740]   why, why do you feel like you're working so much?
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.260]   If even the time diary really says it's not actually that much.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.500]   And it's because it's how we approach our work.
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.500]   It's this fragmented way we approach it.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.380]   This is me throwing on my spin here, this switching back and forth
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.100]   rapidly between many different things.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:40.740]   The cognitive tax of overload of your mind, knowing you have more things going
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.180]   on than you can even imagine completing this all stretches out and exaggerates
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.460]   our senses of busyness.
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:49.020]   So one of Laura's big messages are if you're more careful about your time.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.300]   Organizing when you work on what being careful about what you bring on your
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.900]   plate, be careful about your systems.
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.940]   Without even having to substantially change much of what you're actually
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:02.060]   working on from a quantity standpoint, you can make yourself feel much less.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.380]   Much less overworked.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.580]   If you just get a little bit more intentional about your time, you might
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.340]   have more time to work with than you think.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.820]   And this idea of course resonates with me as well.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:17.100]   My multi-scale planning philosophy, multi-scale time management planning
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.740]   philosophy is a perfect way.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.020]   It is built around actually confronting the reality of your work and your
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.460]   schedule and making the most of it.
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.980]   And it does make a big difference.
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:29.540]   And again, this is something I think the anti-productivity
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.060]   advocates often get wrong.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.620]   They think about these systems or they think about books like Laura.
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.540]   As being focused on trying to fit more in.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.700]   Oh, you have more time than you think.
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:39.900]   Great.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.900]   We can fit in more work.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.020]   That's not Laura's point.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.940]   Her point is you have more time than you think.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.980]   So if we get smarter about how we organize your work, you can be less stressed.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.540]   Same thing with multi-scale productivity planning.
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.700]   The anti-productivity people will say, oh, the whole point of multi-scale time
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.180]   management is to try to fit more work in.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.100]   That's not the case.
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.220]   It's about trying to take the work that you already have and make it more
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:00.900]   sustainable.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:06.140]   The more you can control, the more you can turn down the volume of the stress
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.340]   and the overload.
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.300]   So anyways, Laura's book there is very valuable.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.100]   All right.
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.180]   So Jesse, those are the eight books.
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.060]   There's so many other books that I really like.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:14.540]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.460]   If I'm omitting a book here, it's not because I don't think it's important.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.500]   It's just, these were the first eight that came to mind.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.620]   They're eight that have really big ideas I like.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.740]   There's another eight more I could probably list.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.140]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.900]   There's also other ideas in each of these books.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.980]   I'm just trying to pick out one idea in particular that I that I happen to like.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.940]   We could do future books in future episodes.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.580]   We really should.
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.180]   We really should.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.780]   And of course, left out of this is my own books.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.780]   Of course, those all have big ideas.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:41.500]   So what we have now is we do have some questions that are all roughly orbiting
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.940]   this theme of productivity and productivity books and big productivity ideas.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.940]   I mean, that's a broad topic.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.860]   So we had no trouble finding those questions.
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:51.500]   Uh, before we get there though, I want to briefly mention one of the sponsors
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.980]   that makes this show possible.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.020]   And that is our friends at cozy earth bedding.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:01.660]   I have to say, uh, you know, I mentioned this last time, a couple of weeks ago,
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.100]   cozy earth sheets are my absolute favorite.
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:08.660]   It was the thing I missed the most when I was up in New Hampshire.
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.340]   This summer was having those sheets.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:15.340]   I really like, so as we came home from New Hampshire and we put on the cozy
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.860]   earth sheets and we loved it, and then there was a week where we, we rotated
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:22.660]   out the normal sheets and those just got changed back to cozy earth sheets.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.620]   On, uh, the day before I recorded this and I'm again, really happy.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.820]   They really are just very, very comfortable sheets.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.420]   Uh, they have all sorts of other, I mean, in addition to just being
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:35.380]   really comfortable, um, they regulate temperature well, but I just
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.420]   got to get to the core of this.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.180]   These are really, really comfortable sheets.
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.500]   My wife and I have bought multiple pairs so that we can try to keep
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.860]   them on the bed as much as possible.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.740]   There's a reason why this brand has made Oprah's favorite
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.940]   things five years in a row.
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.180]   Now here's the thing.
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.100]   If you try the sheets and you don't agree that they're more
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.980]   comfortable, that they're cooler.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.620]   Cozy earth will refund your purchase price.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.220]   Plus shipping.
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:01.740]   No questions asked.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.460]   You have a hundred nights to try them out.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.420]   That's right.
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.900]   100 nights.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.180]   They can make that guarantee because they're so nice.
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.300]   You probably aren't going to return them.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.300]   Uh, we also have a good discount to offer you for a limited time.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:19.780]   You can save up to 40% on cozy earth, go to cozy earth.com and enter my

[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:38.340]   I also want to talk about our friends at Henson shaving.
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:43.500]   This is the razor I use to get my famously close shave.
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.140]   I love Henson shaving because I love good tools.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:50.380]   The Henson razor is a beautiful, well-manufactured tool.
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.740]   It's a precision precision.
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.620]   I don't know what the word is.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.540]   What do you call the word?
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:02.340]   What's the word Jesse for carving something out of metal crafted forged.
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:02.740]   I don't know.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:08.340]   Um, I don't know how they do it, but let's just say they precisely
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.020]   engineer these razors because this is the Henson's business.
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:14.180]   Uh, before they got involved in razors, they worked with.
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.540]   Aerospace parts manufacturing.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.140]   We're talking about parts for the ISS or Mars rover.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.540]   So they know how to engineer incredibly precise parts.
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.700]   They they've engineered this beautiful piece of aluminum.
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:28.820]   You put a single 10 cent safety razor blade into a Henson razor.
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:33.940]   You screw it in and it's so precisely milled or whatever the term is that the
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:40.900]   edge of the blade extends minusculely past the edge of the actual razor.
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:46.740]   So no wobbling up and down diving board effect, which means no next, no clogging,
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.100]   but a really clean shave with just a single blade.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.300]   So you get this beautifully engineered razor.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.740]   Then you can use just standard safety, safety, razor blades in the, in the
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.060]   razor, they get this beautiful shave every time this of course is cost effective as
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.820]   well, you pay more upfront for the beautiful tool, but because you're the,
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.700]   the blades you're using are so cheap, it doesn't take long at all before the cost
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:11.180]   of using your Henson razor is much cheaper than a subscription services or buying the
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.140]   expensive plastic things at the drug store.
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.060]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:24.460]   lifetime, visit Henson, shaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you and use code CAL
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.020]   to get two years worth of blades for free with your razor.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.740]   Just make sure you add the two year supply of blades to your cart.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.500]   And then when you add the promo code CAL, the price of the
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.860]   blades will go down to zero.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.620]   That's 100 free blades.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:45.100]   When you head to H E N S O N S H A V I N G.com/cal and use that code CAL.
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.580]   Metalworking or soldering?
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.980]   Metalworking.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:49.340]   Okay.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.420]   I looked it up.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:50.740]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:55.100]   So they're, they're a precision metalworking at Henson shaving.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:59.260]   I think we probably need like a metal precision metal mill in my maker lab.
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:33:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.020]   So I could just mold aluminum.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.500]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.900]   And you can incorporate that in your light project.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.940]   Custom aluminum precision parts for my light project.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:09.460]   All right.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.460]   Enough of that nonsense.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.500]   Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.380]   Who do we have first?
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.740]   First question's from Diana.
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:18.180]   I'm a researcher and I'm trying to get better at time management.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:22.620]   One issue I keep running up against is that I can't control nor anticipate when
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:26.700]   exactly I'll get that critical aha moment of insight for a project.
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:31.300]   I feel like the work that happens after the said aha moment is the most
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:36.380]   productive, but I obviously can't write, chase dead ends and mull over the RQ
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.780]   for an undetermined period of time.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:43.300]   Why I'm struck on divine inspiration as an activity in my delivery plan.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.540]   Do you have any advice?
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.620]   Well, Diana, this is a common question.
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.980]   What happens when you have a big idea and you need to work on it, but you
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.980]   already have a plan for the day and it doesn't involve you working for the next
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.940]   two hours, trying to chase down a big idea.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.060]   Well, you have two options here.
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.860]   So option number one, if the idea is important, work on it.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:06.340]   Because you have to remember if you're, let's say you're planning your day, using
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.060]   something like time block planning.
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:12.300]   Of course, check out timeblockplanner.com for my own second edition
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.180]   of the time block planner.
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:18.500]   But if you're time blocking your hours, it's easy to get into the mindset that
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.820]   you are playing a game where you win.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:24.260]   If you never change your plan, if you build the perfect plan and you stick with
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:28.740]   the plan, and if you leave the plan, then you've lost, that's an easy game to fall
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.380]   into because our mind likes these simple binaries.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.340]   I win.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.260]   If I do this, I lose.
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.740]   If I do that, but it's not the point of time block play.
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.100]   Why are you planning the hours of your day so that you can have intention
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.420]   about how you spend your time?
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.660]   What are you trying to avoid by time blocking your day?
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:49.700]   Wasting particular time and energy doing low value activity for the moment or
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.340]   switching back and forth between a lot of things.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:55.300]   You don't want to squander the time you put aside for work.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.700]   You want to make the most out of it.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.740]   So a time block plan gives you some intention.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.020]   So what happens if a really good idea pops up?
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:07.060]   Well, working on that really good idea sounds like a very intentional use of
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.820]   your time as far as I'm concerned.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.620]   That's not wasting your time.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.820]   That's not squandering your time.
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.060]   That's not just being distracted and letting three hours go.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.820]   That's an incredibly productive use of your time.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.460]   I have an idea that's important to my work and I'm going to work on it.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.580]   So the big idea comes up, work on it.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:25.820]   And then when you're done working on it, next time you have a chance, cross out
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.420]   the remainder of your time block plan and build the best plan you can for
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.580]   the time that remains.
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.300]   That's it.
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:35.620]   That satisfies the goal of I'm being very intentional about my schedule.
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:40.900]   So once you leave that mindset that somehow not changing your time block plan
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:44.860]   is winning and instead say, what I'm trying to avoid is just not having a plan,
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:49.180]   then you'll feel completely fine about pursuing a big idea in the moment.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:50.380]   All right.
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.020]   Now let's say here's option number two.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:56.380]   Let's say it's an important idea, but it's not critical that you work on it in
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.060]   the moment.
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.060]   Your bigger concern is you don't want to forget it.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:03.020]   Like, let's say, for example, you're working on a book in the background.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.020]   Now, on a particular day, you have a pretty busy day that has nothing to do with
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:06.460]   your book.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.380]   You have some meetings, you're trying to get progress on some work stuff that's
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:13.380]   due, and you have an insight right in the middle of this for a chapter that you're
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.180]   going to work on your book.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:14.780]   Like, you know what?
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.140]   If I did this with this chapter, it's going to be much better.
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.700]   You don't want to forget that, but you also don't want to, in this case, it's not
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.180]   the best use of your time, the deep six, the rest of your work schedule to start
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:25.900]   working on your book.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:32.060]   What you can do in these cases is have a place anywhere to capture notes about
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:32.260]   this.
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.060]   Take five minutes.
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.100]   Okay.
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:38.300]   Think about for chapter seven, this, this, this, this, this, this, and then just put
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.980]   a note in your capture system.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.260]   Process my notes on the book chapter.
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.820]   So if you're using something like a time block planner, you just put it right
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:46.980]   there in the little task list.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:51.020]   Remember, I wrote down notes and I don't care if you wrote the notes in a $500
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:54.940]   remarkable dedicated to books or in a text file that you just do on your desktop.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.260]   The point is you have a capture system.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.780]   You say process notes about books.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:03.100]   And now you can move on and return back to your time block schedule because you
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.420]   know, at the end of the day, as you go through your shutdown routine, one of the
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.180]   things you're going to do is process all those tasks you've jotted down.
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.900]   And when you see the task about, uh, Hey, remember those notes I took on my book,
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.540]   you can either move that into your permanent task system to deal with later,
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.860]   or take some time right there to move those notes over to wherever you're
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.020]   working on your book so that you'll see them next time you work on them.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.580]   And then that's handle.
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:29.060]   So if it's something that's important long-term, but not important that you
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.460]   work on it in the moment, this is where you just throw down the notes somewhere,
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.660]   put up placeholders, what David Allen would call a stake in the ground in your
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.460]   task system.
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.500]   So, you know, you won't forget it.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.500]   So you can move your mind back a hundred percent to what you're working on.
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.820]   And you move on.
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.100]   All right.
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.220]   So Dan, don't be worried about plans changing.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.660]   Uh, that's fine.
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.500]   What you want to do is be intentional.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.300]   And if you have a lot of ideas, you don't want to work on at the time, just
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:58.700]   make sure your capture system and shutdown routines are up to up to code as they
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.500]   would say, because the key there is to make sure that this doesn't sit there
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.660]   like an open loop in your mind and distract you from the other work that
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:05.300]   you're returning to.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.540]   All right.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.020]   Who do we have next?
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:08.340]   Jesse.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.140]   Next question is from John, a surgeon.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.580]   Time block time blocking was always my safety net when my schedule got hectic
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.940]   as an undergrad or medical student, but it's nearly impossible to do now that
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:23.980]   I'm a surgeon surgeries get added or removed at a whim, new patients who need
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.940]   me to be seen immediately show up without notice, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.460]   And this isn't just a one one-time thing.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:34.100]   I would say 75% or more of my days are shaped on the fly.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:38.060]   This variability is an addition to the sheer time burden of my job, pretty
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.300]   much 80 hours a week.
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.540]   I need a new strategy to help me get things done.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.660]   I hate the list reactive way of things, but that's how I've been getting by.
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.780]   Well, John surgery is one of these jobs.
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:54.980]   There's other jobs, many of which are in medicine, but others that are in other
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:57.820]   fields that are by definition reactive.
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.060]   It's I'm a surgeon.
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:05.100]   If there is a surgical emergency, I have to go do this surgery.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.580]   Uh, there's also then going to be suddenly post-op checkups and other
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:10.820]   things to get thrown on my schedule.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.620]   So it sounds like you have a fundamentally reactive schedule.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:18.500]   You're not gonna be able to time block that your days are going to be built around.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:23.300]   Here is my major thing I have to do and being flexible.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.540]   So what's the right thing to do in those cases is to simplify everything
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.540]   else you can about your job.
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:34.020]   If you have one of these fundamentally reactive jobs, you want to focus on doing
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:38.020]   these things in your case surgery, as well as possible and trying to minimize.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.820]   Everything else you cannot, I mean, you can, but I'm going to say you should not
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:48.140]   take the mindset that you might've had as an undergrad or in med school, where I am
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:52.300]   going to establish my impressiveness by doing three or four different things.
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:56.180]   And you're gonna be so impressed that I'm, I'm doing my studies and running
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:58.980]   this organization and training for this mirror, I'm doing all these things at once.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.260]   And your impressiveness, your impression of me is going to be driven by.
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.700]   The quantity of different things I do.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.340]   You have to abandon that mindset.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:08.260]   You're a surgeon.
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.300]   You want to be a good surgeon.
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.700]   You want your life outside of surgery to be as flexible as possible.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.820]   So that if something pops up, you're like, this is what I'm doing today.
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.460]   This surgery.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:21.460]   And this is a life where you're going to have downtime in between these things.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.500]   Flexibility, flexibility, flexibility.
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.780]   That's what you want to be aiming for.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.540]   The stuff you do have to get done.
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:27.980]   It's fine.
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:29.580]   You can tackle it day by day.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.340]   I have a really good capture system for your tasks.
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:36.460]   Be like, uh, ongoing heuristics, flexible heuristics for regular work.
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:41.340]   Hey, if I could get three sessions a week in on my whatever duties as director of
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.380]   whatever lab at the hospital, I'll be fine.
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.060]   Uh, so that can be helpful too.
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:45.300]   Okay.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.100]   This day I have room for one of these sessions.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.460]   These two days I didn't.
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.140]   So I need to fit one in these last two days.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:54.180]   So flexible heuristics, good capture systems for tasks, fit in work where
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.380]   you have time during the day.
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.580]   Don't overschedule yourself.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:00.380]   Do all that, but keep your overall number of obligations small.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.900]   You've already, you're a successful, impressive person.
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.740]   It's hard to be a surgeon.
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.100]   Do that.
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.300]   Well, don't do other things.
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:10.700]   Especially as you elaborated in the longer version of this question, you have a new,
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:15.180]   you're a, you have kids, they're new, you're, your family's young and growing.
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:18.380]   And I'm seeing in your elaborated version of this question, these like national
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.580]   organizations you're involved with, you got to get rid of all that.
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:23.380]   I'm already impressed with you for being a surgeon.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.660]   So just do that well with huge flexibility.
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:29.100]   And that's what makes a job like that sustainable.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:34.140]   If you try to do the other thing, I want to, uh, a huge high, high skill, high
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:38.380]   time demand, unpredictable job and do five or six other things, there's really
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:42.100]   no recourse to that except for you stay up really late, you work every weekend.
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:45.700]   And my point there, John, is why you're doing interesting work and
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.940]   helping the world by being a surgeon.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:53.780]   Is it really so important that you, what become department head or at your
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:58.420]   hospital at a young age or something, you know, is to what end you're making a lot
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:42:59.620]   of money, you're doing something important.
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:00.940]   It's high skill is satisfying.
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.020]   So I've been increasingly pitching that to people that have
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.220]   fundamentally reactive jobs.
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:06.660]   I say, great, make your life easier.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.540]   Make your life as easy as possible.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.940]   Given the reality of the highly reactive job.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:16.340]   That's pretty similar to the student advice you give to, for, you know, kids,
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.540]   like not doing too many activities outside of school and just getting best grades.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:20.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.260]   Don't do, uh, make your schedules easier.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:23.460]   Yeah.
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.580]   It's like the number one.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.460]   When I used to work with college students, give talks about college students,
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.380]   stress, the number one source of college students stress was
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.380]   schedules that were too hard.
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.380]   And there's very little you can do about a schedule.
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:35.620]   That's really, really hard.
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:41.100]   If you have two majors and nine activities and a job, there's nothing I could do to
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.500]   make that student's life sustainable.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.700]   It's just too many things.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:44.060]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.700]   And I would say, what you got to do is do less.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:49.860]   I used to have the slides when I would give a talk at this case study.
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.420]   I don't remember the guy's name.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.460]   It started with, it was like TOEF or something like this.
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:54.100]   It was kind of weird.
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:59.020]   And he was a student and he had this, uh, this interesting case study where he had
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:03.220]   gone to a study abroad in Australia, I believe it was.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:07.180]   So before he went to a study abroad in Australia, he was completely burnt out.
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:11.380]   And because he had multiple majors and all these clubs and a job, and he was
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.900]   really stressed out and he went to Australia and for a bunch of contingent
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.580]   reasons, uh, he couldn't get a, he couldn't get a job because he was
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:19.420]   from a different country.
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:22.940]   He couldn't get all the normal hard course load because you had to get majors
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.100]   approved and he couldn't get most of the courses approved.
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:28.500]   And it turned out to do activities, extracurricular activities.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.780]   You had to pay for an activity card that he couldn't afford.
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:36.700]   So he was doing a, a under-scheduled course load, no activities, no job.
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.180]   It was this huge epiphany for him.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.060]   He's like, wait a second.
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.980]   I just have more than enough time to focus on my courses.
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.780]   He crushed the courses because he had so much time to focus on them.
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:49.380]   Uh, the professors thought he was a star.
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:54.180]   So he comes back from the study abroad, cuts off all the activities, reduces his
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:45:00.180]   major, gives himself this huge schedule, a hugely open schedule, crushes his courses.
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.180]   His professors think he's a star and all these opportunities open up.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:07.540]   And the slides I used to use was he took a snapshot of his calendar.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.740]   From now at the time with his simplified schedule.
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.300]   And it was like course, course, empty day course, like just all this white.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.820]   And then he used the time machine feature on his Mac to go back a year earlier and
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.740]   take a snapshot of his calendar on the same week from a couple of years before.
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.460]   And it was just, just completely full of stuff.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.780]   And I used to show those two side by side.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:31.140]   So yeah, doing fewer things is such a powerful tool.
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:32.420]   Uh, but you just get trained.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:33.820]   I'm sure John, I'm kind of a surgeon.
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:34.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:39.420]   Great grades, you know, went to a medical school, crushed it in medical school, got
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:42.260]   a good residency, got a good fellowship, always impressing everyone.
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:45.300]   And so you just have this mindset of, I do a lot of things.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.420]   And that's what makes me impressive.
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:49.660]   But by the time you get to the thing you're going to do, you're going to be a
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:51.020]   surgeon, no, just do your surgery.
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:51.340]   Well,
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:55.020]   and engineer the rest of your life to be as livable as possible.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:55.980]   Given that reality.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.460]   Yep.
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:56.740]   Yeah.
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:57.700]   People don't often think that.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.700]   All right, let's keep rolling.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.020]   Next question's from Rachel.
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:06.220]   You've often mentioned how the business of books is to continually keep contact
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:07.940]   coming as the demand never ends.
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:11.900]   How should one couple this insight with the plethora of productivity and self
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.300]   help books that are constantly published?
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.740]   Can there be that many new ideas?
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:23.300]   Well, Rachel, my advice is every time you're tempted to buy a book on any topic,
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:28.820]   really, if you want to maximize your return, instead go and buy multiple copies of my
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.980]   books, because you know, you're not going to be let down by my books.
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.780]   Everyone should just buy my books again and again.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.180]   Now, are we running out of ideas?
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.300]   Here's the thing, Rachel.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.460]   Your premise is correct.
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:45.100]   So when you say here, the business of books is to continually keep content coming.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.780]   It is true the point that publishers biggest issue is actually they don't have enough
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:50.540]   books to publish.
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:54.220]   Because there is a lot of books are bought each year.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.860]   There's a lot of people buying books.
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:59.900]   The more books they can put out in some sense, the better.
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:05.300]   So why do they have a hard time getting enough books to fill their pipelines?
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.700]   Well, it's actually because their standards are high.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:08.740]   Right.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:12.060]   I mean, for a publisher to publish a book, they want it to be a good book.
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.820]   Well written with a good idea written by someone who makes sense that they wrote it.
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:20.940]   So this is why I'm saying if you can if you can cross that bar as an aspiring writer, I
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.460]   have something to say that people care about.
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.340]   I can write it well and I'm the right person to write it.
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:29.180]   You're not going to have that much of a hard time getting a book deal.
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:32.980]   Book publishers are not in the business of gatekeeping so much as in the business of
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.700]   desperately trying to find good stuff to publish.
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:37.260]   But what does that mean for the reader?
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:41.100]   Well, there's a lot of readers and there's a lot of genres.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:45.500]   And so I would not worry that in your particular genre you care about, that there's
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.580]   going to be too many books.
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:49.180]   So let's consider productivity in particular.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:54.380]   I think there's this there's this understanding, this vision of the world of
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.540]   productivity books.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:01.020]   That a lot of people hold and I think is completely disconnected from reality.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:06.660]   So if you talk to a lot of people, they're they're guests at the productivity book
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:12.420]   space is that there are hundreds of these books being published every year and most
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.180]   of them are saying you got to hustle.
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.980]   You got to do more things.
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:17.620]   Busyness is great.
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.260]   It's bad to not be not be working.
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.700]   How can you do more work?
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:26.180]   Right. You hear this this straw man vision of the productivity book industry is
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:27.460]   discussed all the time.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:32.860]   I mean, people are always setting up like, you know, I'm so brave because I'm pushing
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:37.020]   back against all of those books that are saying the more tasks you do, the better.
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.540]   And I'm saying you should do less task.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:42.220]   And I'm look, I might get killed for this, but I'm so brave.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:43.500]   Here's the reality.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.780]   No one's publishing that book.
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:50.540]   I don't remember the last time I've seen a book, I went over eight productivity books
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:51.300]   at the beginning of the show.
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.540]   None of them are saying, how do you do more work?
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.900]   How do you fit in more tasks?
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:59.380]   I can think of essentially, I don't know, one book that's ever really been about
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.100]   that. And there was this book called Extreme Productivity.
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.940]   And it was just a no nonsense guide for executives.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:09.260]   Basically, look, executives to succeed, they have to do a lot of things.
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:13.220]   And here is how I, as an executive, balanced a bunch of different things and tried to
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:15.180]   fit more in because he was being honest.
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.100]   If you're a C-suite type, it helps.
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:21.380]   That's like the only book I can think of in the last 10 years that even was in the
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:24.100]   vicinity of saying, how do you do a lot more things?
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:29.380]   Also, the volume of books being published in the productivity space is pretty small.
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.180]   I know this space very well.
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.660]   I know all the writers, all the major writers in the space.
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.140]   I know the major editors in the space.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:41.100]   This is not a space that has a huge number, especially if we're talking about big
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:45.820]   publishers, they're high quality titles like books coming out of Portfolio at
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:46.980]   Penguin, for example.
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.540]   You're looking at these books.
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.060]   There's not that many that are coming out.
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:54.140]   And they tend to be pretty thoughtful and have a pretty specific point of view.
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:58.740]   You know, like I have my book on slow productivity coming out.
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:04.500]   The last book I wrote that was about work productivity, I guess you go back three
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.220]   years to get like a world without email.
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:07.860]   But really, that was more a critique of work.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:13.300]   You got to go back six years before that or five years to get to deep work.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.460]   I mean, these books don't come out that often.
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.980]   So, Rachel, I wouldn't worry about it.
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:22.060]   If you look at books about work and productivity that top tier publishers are
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.180]   publishing, these are thoughtful titles.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.260]   There's not that many of them.
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.420]   Buy the ones that resonate.
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.660]   They're going to have ideas that are good.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:33.060]   It's just simply not the case that these big publishers are publishing nonsense.
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:37.740]   They're just not the 10 ways to get more done does not exist as a major
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:38.620]   publication book.
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.220]   No one is publishing that right now.
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.700]   It does not exist.
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.900]   So I think you're OK, Rachel.
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:47.540]   This might not be the case in other genres, but the productivity genre, I think, is
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:50.540]   not as crowded or as poor quality as you might fear.
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:56.420]   It's true, you know, it's to the point now where if you publish the book that was
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:00.460]   like 10 ways to get a lot more done, that book might actually do well because it
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:01.780]   would be so different than everything.
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:05.860]   I mean, every book right now in productivity always starts the same way.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:09.940]   I'm not one of these guys telling you the, you know, they get more done and
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.780]   hustle. Where are these guys?
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.500]   I cannot find these books.
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:17.380]   I think if you leaned into the opposite and are just like, do more stuff because
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.380]   that's what matters.
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.220]   50 tips.
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:23.380]   The contrarianism of that actually, ironically, paradoxically, might make that
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.180]   book sell really well.
[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:28.220]   Well, one of those guys you could probably find, you know, from those like on
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:29.220]   YouTube with those.
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.060]   They're on YouTube.
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:30.540]   Yeah.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:31.500]   YouTube.
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:32.060]   Stuff like that.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:32.780]   Social media.
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:38.260]   YouTube has this weird productivity culture, but YouTube has a lot of weird
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:41.020]   cultures because there's a lot of people publishing videos on there.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.660]   There's a whole culture on there of people who just work like 10 hours and they
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:45.100]   film it.
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.540]   So here's a 10 hour video of me working.
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:48.140]   Yeah.
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.340]   Which is.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:49.540]   That's what I was thinking about.
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.540]   But YouTube just does this on every topic.
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:55.060]   On every topic, there's going to be a subculture where people push a topic to an
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:57.020]   extreme because that makes for interesting watching.
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:58.060]   I mean, it's every topic.
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:02.820]   If you're in the bread baking, you can find a whole YouTube subculture about, uh,
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:03.780]   I'm a hundred loafer.
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:07.220]   I bake a hundred loaves a day, you know, or I bake the biggest bread you've ever
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:07.580]   seen.
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.100]   It's just extremes work well on YouTube.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:14.260]   So every topic has a subculture of extremes, but that does not stand in for how the
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:15.780]   publishing industry thinks about productivity.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:19.700]   But if you take your advice, you like, we never see it because like we're not on
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.860]   social media and we have those YouTube blockers.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:22.540]   That's true.
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:25.700]   And, but the authors that write those other books probably do see it because they
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:26.900]   probably on social media.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:27.700]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:27.980]   You're right.
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:32.100]   Those of us writing these books, we're not as seen on YouTube with like, here's a
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.700]   video of me just working a little bit and then going and doing something else.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:36.220]   It's not that interesting, I guess.
[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:40.140]   I'm hanging out with my kid because I didn't work that much today.
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:41.300]   Oh, well.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:42.420]   All right.
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:42.780]   What do we got?
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:43.780]   Let's get a couple more in here.
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:46.820]   Here's a question from Kyle.
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:51.580]   Your conversations about the deep life remind me some of the seven habits of
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.620]   highly effective people.
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.700]   And in particular, the goal to start with the end in mind.
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.220]   Was Covey an influence of your thinking?
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:03.140]   Well, Kyle, very perceptive because we talked about this in the opening segment of
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.060]   today's episode.
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:09.340]   Yes, I think Covey influenced me and a lot of people who are in this sort of
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:12.420]   humanistic productivity space that's become so popular recently.
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:17.300]   His early writing that book about starting with the end in mind.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:22.420]   Figure out what you're trying to do in the different roles of your life and then
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:26.260]   work backwards to figure out how your activities can be organized to support
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:26.940]   those visions.
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:28.060]   I think it's really important.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:34.260]   It grounded productivity as a means towards a more philosophically rich end.
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:38.860]   And I think that has reemerged in our current moment of humanistic productivity
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:42.820]   where people are now thinking about all of this type of thinking as a way to
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.420]   intentionally craft your life.
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.860]   And so, you know, you see Covey's influence in so many important books in this
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:48.180]   space.
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:52.020]   Tim Ferriss, I think that's that's very Covey influenced.
[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:57.300]   We're seeing it certainly in something like 4000 Weeks or Oliver Berkman's book,
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.060]   right again, is very Covey influence.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:53:59.940]   You only have so much time.
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:00.740]   What do you want to do with it?
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:04.500]   So I think that's a good question.
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:08.900]   And yes, I think Covey, which I read young, definitely influenced me that you need a
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:13.220]   purpose for your productivity or you're going to find yourself in this sort of
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:21.460]   peak 2006 productivity prawn, making your Mac Macintosh macro so that your KTG
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:26.380]   KGTD configuration can automatically pull tasks from your quick search, quick
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.660]   silver taskbar.
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:32.380]   You just end up in that world of just optimizing because you think optimizing is
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:35.260]   fun or productivity systems are like hot rods.
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:39.500]   It's just you just get fun and tuning them up for the sake of tuning them up, not
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:42.500]   because it helps you get from here to where you're trying to go.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:43.740]   And that's fun for some people.
[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:48.660]   But that's where you end up if you don't ground productivity, bigger vision.
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.060]   And Covey helped me do that.
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:50.940]   It's a good book.
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.820]   I recommend people, if you haven't read it, read it.
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:54.780]   It's not what you necessarily think.
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:57.740]   All right, Jesse, let's let's do one more.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:58.300]   We got time.
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.740]   We have a question from Carissa.
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:04.940]   I really like the concept of the deep life stack and especially the emphasis that is
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:07.380]   the iterative process rather than a linear process.
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:11.460]   Does establishing discipline count if the discipline comes through an external
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:13.940]   pressure rather than from a self-imposed structure?
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:18.980]   I went back to school for my master's in my 30s and started off working a full
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.340]   time job simultaneously.
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:24.140]   This forced me into a routine where I had to be productive in the evenings instead
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:27.580]   of leaning into my usual sloth habits like watching TV.
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:32.140]   Since finishing my degree and returning back to work, I've realized that unless I
[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:35.260]   have an external pressure, then I have little sense of urgency that pressures me
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:37.020]   to consistently commit to an activity.
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:42.260]   So I'm not sure if I established discipline for myself, but have shown myself that I
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:46.740]   can work even when I'm tired and that the small, consistent effort over time can
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:47.660]   yield results.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:51.340]   Well, as we talk about on the show and when we talk about what we talk about, the
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:54.660]   deep life stack, discipline is an identity.
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:56:00.940]   So your goal is to convince yourself that you're a disciplined person, by which we
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:06.340]   mean someone who can make effort towards something important, even if in the short
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:10.340]   term, it's not fun or even if the short term, there's no pressure to have to do so.
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:15.180]   So transforming your self identity into a disciplined person is the foundation on
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:17.060]   which you could do all sorts of cool stuff in your life.
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:21.820]   So the exposure to discipline you had by your degree program is useful.
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:27.460]   It showed you what it's like to have a life that has more discipline in it.
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:30.220]   OK, I got to work, I got to follow a schedule, I can't just do what I want to
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.420]   do. So that's useful.
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:34.220]   That's no longer a mystery.
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:38.980]   But if you want to fully transition your self identity to one of a disciplined
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:44.700]   person, the next step and an unavoidable step is introducing some things you do for
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:46.740]   no other reason than you think it's important.
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:52.940]   So you do need to have some disciplined pursuits for which there is not external
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:59.460]   pressure. You do need to convince yourself, I will deny myself this or pursue this or
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.500]   do this thing, but I don't really feel like doing it today on a consistent basis.
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:06.420]   Based purely on my own vision for what I want for my life, not because I'm going to
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.780]   fail out of this course or not because my boss is going to get mad.
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:11.100]   So you still have that step ahead of you.
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:14.660]   If you're not, if you're worried about it, I mean, follow what I talk about.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:15.900]   We talk about the deep life stack.
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:20.100]   Start with some keystone habits, two to three things covering two to three different
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.260]   areas of your life.
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:27.420]   Tractable, not trivial, but also tractable.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:29.780]   So not super easy, but not really, really hard.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.500]   Find that sweet spot in the middle.
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:34.380]   Make it three different parts of your life, a professional thing, a health and fitness
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:36.940]   thing, and either a hobby or social connection thing.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:40.500]   And get those three keystone habits going.
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:47.380]   That's how you begin to give yourself this self-efficacious identity of discipline.
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.580]   I can do this even when I'm not being forced to.
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:54.380]   So non-trivial, tractable, keystone habits covering a couple different areas.
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:58.260]   Do that for a month or two, and then you can start layering in something that's a
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:03.340]   little bit more ambitious, a more progress towards a more ambitious, self-driven
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:07.140]   pursuit. Do that for a while, and your self-identity is going to flip.
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:12.220]   When you see yourself as a disciplined person, everything becomes possible.
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:16.140]   And that's why I push that as the first step in moving towards the deep life.
[00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:17.700]   It's not making the big decisions.
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:20.300]   It's not buying the Peloton or moving to the country.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:24.820]   It starts with these small habits that you practice doing for no other reason than
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:27.060]   you think they're important for you and your vision of your life.
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:31.260]   If you're someone who's willing to put an effort now to shape a vision for what
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.940]   you want in the future, there's a lot that becomes available.
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:36.180]   All right.
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.180]   Uh, we've got a final segment coming up here.
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:42.220]   I'm going to talk about the books I read in August, but first I want to mention
[00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:44.540]   another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:47.020]   It's a newest sponsor, but I'm glad to have them.
[00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:48.740]   And that's our friends at Mosh.
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:51.700]   M O S H.
[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:55.660]   If you're busy and constantly on the go, like me, you need to try Mosh.
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:59.220]   It's a protein bar made for your brain.
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:58:59.660]   All right.
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:01.500]   So Mosh has six delicious flavors.
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:05.980]   Each bar has 12 grams of protein and is made with ingredients that support brain
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:11.340]   health, like ashwagandha, lion's mane, collagen, and omega threes at 160
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:13.100]   calories and only one gram of sugar.
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.700]   Mosh protein bars are the guilt free snack.
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.820]   Your brain and body will crave.
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:21.100]   I have really been enjoying the Mosh bars because a, they taste great.
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:25.220]   It's a, they're soft with some crunch in them, which I really
[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:26.620]   like and the flavors are very good.
[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:30.020]   Um, I'm also someone who does not respond well to a lot of sugar.
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:33.780]   So I really like bars where it looks, it's got some protein, but
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:34.900]   it's not going to be full of sugar.
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:38.940]   And then of course you have the, the collagen, the lion's mane, the ashwagandha.
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.660]   Hey, every little bit helps there.
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:45.820]   This is a company that was founded by Patrick Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver.
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:49.700]   It's a mission driven brain health and wellness company that donates a portion
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:53.660]   of all proceeds to support women's brain research to the women's Alzheimer's
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:56.460]   movement at Cleveland clinic.
[00:59:56.460 --> 01:00:01.300]   So you could do what I do is I have these around as one of the things I grab when I
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:05.380]   know, for example, I'm running over to the Deep Work HQ, we got some recording to do.
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.860]   We might blow past lunch.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:10.700]   I want to make sure I keep going, eat a Mosh bar, get some protein, not too much
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.420]   sugar, sharpen my thinking a little bit.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:12.740]   Good.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:16.100]   You know, it's a, I want to get right into my first cup of coffee and
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.420]   get thinking in the morning.
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:20.860]   Worried though, I'm going to get a little tired, Mosh bar, power you through to
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:21.260]   lunch.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:27.020]   It's that perfect tool to fill in the gaps, to keep you going without having to have a
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.460]   bunch of junk, having a bunch of sugar.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:33.420]   So don't settle for a mediocre snack when you can nourish your body and mind with a
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.540]   fuel that needs to succeed.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:38.220]   So whether you're at the gym on the go or just living your best life, Mosh protein
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:41.020]   bars will keep your brain and body fit, fueled and feeling good.

[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.260]   I also want to talk about our friends at Mint Mobile.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.380]   You might've noticed things are getting more expensive these days.
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:19.020]   That's inflation, gas, groceries, utility bills, streaming services, inflation is
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:19.780]   everywhere.
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:23.580]   Thankfully, there's one company out there that's giving you a much needed break and
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:29.220]   that is Mint Mobile as the first company to sell premium wireless service online
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:29.740]   only.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:34.100]   Mint Mobile lets you order from home and save a ton of money with phone plans that
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.100]   start at just $15 a month.
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.380]   So you've got huge savings right there.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:45.460]   If you have a Mint Mobile mobile plan, you can use your own phone with any Mint
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:46.100]   Mobile plan.
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.460]   Keep your same phone number along with your existing content.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:51.860]   You switch to Mint Mobile, you'll get premium wireless service starting at just
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.060]   15 bucks a month.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.500]   I use Mint Mobile for my bat phone.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.900]   So a couple of years ago, I've shown this on camera before.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.020]   I don't have it with me right now.
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:03.460]   Uh, I wanted to have a backup phone that was not a smartphone.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:08.140]   For periods where I was doing long bits of disconnected deep work, but needed to
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:10.140]   be reachable in an emergency.
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:12.500]   So I just bought a phone, a flip phone off Amazon.
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.540]   It was like 70 bucks.
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:17.580]   Mint Mobile is how I put service on that $15 a month.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.300]   This is cheap.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:21.620]   And now I have a fully connected phone.
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.260]   They made it real easy.
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:23.820]   I did online.
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:24.460]   They sent the card.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.100]   I put it in simple.
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:30.180]   So get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month and get that plan shipped
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.060]   to your door for free.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.820]   Go to mintmobile.com/deep.
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:36.340]   That's mintmobile.com/deep.
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:41.580]   To cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month and mintmobile.com/deep.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.980]   And Jesse just found the phone.
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.700]   I knew it was in here somewhere.
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:49.660]   So if you're watching, this is my super cool.
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:53.100]   Definitely does not make me look like I'm 74 years old.
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.100]   Flip phone powered by Mint Mobile.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.780]   Amazon's best.
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.860]   So there you go.
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.180]   I just have to hold this.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:03.180]   Jesse, this needs to be in a holster hanging off my belt.
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:03.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:08.180]   That's what I'm missing or into my fanny pack, but I'm thinking like in a holster
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:10.140]   off my belt next to my fanny pack.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.820]   While you're installing the lights.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:15.660]   While I'm installing the lights, because I'm an old man and metal working and metal
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.260]   soldering or whatever you looked up soldering my own razors.
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.460]   Oh my.
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:20.820]   All right.
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.500]   Uh, final segment.
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.020]   Hey, we're, we're full of books today.
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.780]   We should have been really informally sponsored by people's books at
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.740]   Tacoma park today, because we're just talking about books all day.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:29.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.260]   I'm just in a book mood.
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:33.980]   Our final segment, like I do every month is I talk about the five
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.700]   books I read the month before.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.500]   So we're in September now.
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:42.220]   So I should be reading about the books I read in August 2023.
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.020]   All right.
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:43.980]   So these were all.
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:48.060]   Mainly read when I was still up in Hanover at the Montgomery house
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.700]   as part of my Montgomery fellowship.
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:54.300]   This is important because two of these books were written by past Montgomery
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:59.060]   fellows and the copies I read were signed copies of the books that were there on
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:01.100]   the bookshelf at the Montgomery house.
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:07.220]   So the first one of those was at home in the universe by the system biologist,
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:13.060]   Stuart Kaufman, former Montgomery fellow, former MacArthur genius grant winner.
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:17.860]   This is a public facing book about, uh, he does a lot of work on self
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:22.780]   organization, how complex systems can arise in an emergent fashion.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:25.740]   How, for example, if you have enough reactive chemicals, just
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:30.380]   mixed together in a soup, there's a high chance that, um, uh, among these
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:33.740]   interactions is going to emerge a self-sustaining auto-catalytic system.
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:39.340]   His work ties connections between biology and complexity theory
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.700]   and other types of mathematics.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.660]   It was, I love this book.
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:43.700]   I'm a nerd for that stuff.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:47.140]   Uh, as a theorist, as a computer scientist, I've done a reasonable
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:50.540]   amount of work at the intersection of algorithm theory and biological systems.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:54.220]   So this was speaking my language and I liked that it was a signed copy and
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:58.420]   knowing that this, this guy Kaufman was in this house back in the nineties.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.140]   Thinking about these thoughts.
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:07.100]   It's like a book I read was the soul of an octopus by Si Montgomery.
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:10.220]   I believe lives in New Hampshire, Vermont.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.860]   I think maybe New Hampshire.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:17.380]   Um, this book, I picked it up at bookstore, a still North bookstore
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.500]   up in Hanover, New Hampshire.
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:18.980]   Shout out.
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:20.460]   I picked it up randomly.
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.700]   It's a science nature book that got a lot of acclaim.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.580]   I think it was a finalist for a national book award.
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:29.380]   Won some other nature science writing specific awards.
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:31.380]   It was not what I expected.
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:38.660]   So I thought this was going to be a real deep dive on, on how octopuses, uh,
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:43.220]   ink and their brains and, and their, their evolution and their cool features.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:46.420]   And there was a lot of this, but really the core of this book is that Si it's,
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.140]   it's a, it's a novelistic look at the human characters.
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:54.500]   The book is actually about all of these interesting, often in some ways, um,
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:06:00.780]   broken human characters who found healing through interactions with this animal.
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:04.780]   So Si is spending a lot of time at the Boston aquarium, the
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.140]   new England aquarium in Boston.
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:09.940]   And it's, it's the, the, uh, the volunteers there, the person
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:13.980]   in charge of this exhibit, you get this novelistic look at their inner life.
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:18.380]   And how these, their interactions with octopuses in some
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:19.580]   sense, healed them or saved them.
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:25.380]   So it's a book about people and the octopuses in the book are there to
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:29.060]   draw out this kind of nuanced picture of humans and life and meaning.
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.220]   And it's like, oh, I see why this book won all these awards.
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.860]   It wasn't what I thought.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:33.940]   So that it's a really cool book.
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:35.380]   Soul of an octopus.
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:39.380]   The only thing that's a little weird about it, and maybe I'm just alone about this.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:44.620]   The way Si talks about being, uh, touched by an octopus.
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:48.060]   So there's a lot of these, a lot of time is spent at new England aquarium.
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.220]   The octopuses would come over and like wrap their
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.660]   tentacles around your arm.
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:55.860]   The way she talks about this is that it's just self-evidently the
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.300]   coolest, best thing you could ever do.
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:01.380]   It's like, is there anything better than having octopus
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:02.740]   tentacles wrapped around your arms?
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:07.700]   I mean, it's, it's almost weird to the degree to which she fetishizes
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:11.660]   being touched by octopuses as this like self-evident thing.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:17.180]   It's like, you know, um, uh, combing the mane of your pony type, just
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:21.620]   like what could be better and it does not hit me that way I like this is weird
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:26.020]   and gross and the octopus is going to face suck my face, it's going to pull my
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:28.380]   arms in and rip my nose off with his beak.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.020]   I would be terror.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.180]   It's weird and slimy and they're hard to get off.
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:33.700]   So that's the only thing that was really weird about this is like, I don't think
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:36.940]   Si made the case that this is actually something that normal people like.
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:37.980]   Having octopus.
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:40.700]   She's like immediately in the book, she's obsessed.
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:41.860]   I got it.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:42.620]   I had to get back.
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.020]   I had to get back and have another encounter with the octopus.
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.380]   So I, I, that caught my attention.
[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:48.700]   Uh, the meal seemed weird and strange.
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.380]   I'd be afraid of an octopus, but anyways, really good book.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.620]   The next book was not good at all.
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:57.260]   One of the worst books I've read recently.
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:58.180]   But you finished it.
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:01.140]   I yeah, I got it from the Hanover library.
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:03.940]   I was like, Oh my God, I'm just going to finish this.
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:05.220]   All right.
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:05.820]   I feel bad.
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:09.100]   Uh, I met him once, but he's not going to listen to this.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:12.940]   That book was abduction by Robin cook.
[01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:15.260]   Not a good book.
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.660]   I like Robin cook.
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:20.060]   This is the first time ever that you've talked about a book like this.
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.620]   I just didn't like this book.
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.700]   So, so this was, he wrote this in the early two thousands.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:24.900]   I don't know.
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.300]   He's phoning it in Robin cook.
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:30.020]   Uh, you know, obviously writes typically medical thrillers.
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:34.220]   His first book, which I read earlier this year and talked on the show is fantastic.
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.220]   His thriller coma is a fantastic thriller.
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:39.900]   Uh, most of his books are medical thrillers.
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:44.820]   He was a former doctor and he lives on Beacon Hill and writes these cool books.
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.140]   I really like him as a writer.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.020]   I went to hear him talk at the Beacon Hill civic society once.
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.540]   And I, I like a lot of his books.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.180]   This book is so weird.
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.380]   It's okay.
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:54.180]   Here's what it's about.
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:57.940]   And this is, um, this is, I kept thinking early on, like, this is going to like,
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:59.420]   it's going to be in their head and it's going to shift.
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:08:59.580]   No.
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:02.900]   Uh, people are in a submarine.
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:06.820]   They're doing deep sea drill repair or something like that.
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:07.100]   Right.
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.060]   Which is fine.
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.940]   He knows, uh, cook knows about this world.
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:13.100]   He was involved in early Navy experiments with deep sea diving.
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:13.820]   He was on submarine.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.180]   So all these details are cool.
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:19.620]   Um, they get sucked down this sort of vent at the bottom of the ocean.
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:20.020]   Okay.
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:28.100]   And discover that there is a race of people who live between the earth's like
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:32.660]   crust and mantle in a giant underwater underground civilization.
[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:34.300]   And they've been there for hundreds of thousands of years.
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.580]   People just live under the earth.
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:37.220]   We didn't know about it.
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:45.580]   And they, uh, they all speak English and, um, they have all this technology.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:48.740]   And basically these people are just down in this world of people
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:49.780]   who live underneath the earth.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:51.220]   They don't need sunscreen.
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.540]   They don't need sunscreen.
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:57.140]   Um, it's just preposterous and nothing really interesting to have.
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.180]   It's just, uh, it, it's just the craziest thing.
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:01.780]   And he doesn't like lean into it.
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.340]   It's not a metaphor for things.
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:04.780]   It's not, no, it's just that here we are.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:05.340]   It's under the earth.
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:07.620]   It's like very unimaginative.
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.180]   They're like, they wear togas.
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:12.900]   And you know, the coolest thing about it is like when their bodies are going to
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:15.580]   die, they can transfer their brains into like a new body or something.
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:19.340]   And there's like some of the guys, the divers who got stuck down there, these
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.940]   like completely caricatured drunken oafs and they kill some people and they're
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:25.420]   hiding them in the freezer and like, we have to escape.
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:30.020]   I mean, people living under the secret race, living under the earth,
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.340]   and it's just all played straight.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:32.460]   I don't know.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.220]   I think it was funny then.
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.340]   It's not good.
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.500]   And there's like, oh, I guess there's just a hidden race of people live under
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:37.820]   the earth.
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.460]   All right, moving on.
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:40.780]   It's just so stupid.
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:42.820]   I like Robin cook.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.460]   Do not like that book.
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.820]   Um, all right.
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.180]   Another Montgomery fellow book.
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:52.060]   I read the F the affluent society by John Kenneth Galbraith.
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:11:00.060]   So his sort of famous work of, uh, so junk has Galbraith is from that sort of,
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:03.660]   uh, a generation of, of highly trained advisors from the Kennedy era.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:07.500]   I think he went on to be the, our ambassador to India at some point,
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:12.260]   economist did a lot of thinking on sort of, um, liberal economic theory.
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:15.940]   There's this famous book he wrote in the fifties called the affluent society,
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:19.140]   where he's saying essentially now that the U S we're, we're, we're wealthy,
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:19.420]   right?
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:24.900]   Uh, we have to rethink our economic policy as a, as a, as a wealthy
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:28.980]   superpower, the, we, we need to rethink how we think about our economic policy
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.500]   than the way we might've thought about it before.
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.940]   So it's a public facing economic analysis book.
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:38.020]   He was a Montgomery fellow and they had a version that came out in the seventies
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:38.500]   and nineties.
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.260]   So he's, you know, he was old then, you know, read a signed copy of it.
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:41.860]   It's interesting.
[01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:44.820]   People have longer attention spans back then.
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:49.860]   Um, he just, it's so, uh, magisterial and just, I'm just going to explain these
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:50.300]   things.
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:53.940]   Uh, I was really taken by the degree to when you're writing these books in the
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:57.180]   fifties, you did not feel the need to hold a reader's hand.
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.180]   Okay.
[01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.660]   I've got, here's my big point.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.860]   I'm going to get to this point in these three chapters.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:02.060]   Okay.
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:03.140]   Part two is all about this.
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.820]   No, it's like long essays.
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:08.300]   And as you read it, you begin to draw out of it, these different ideas he has.
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:11.980]   It's more discursive and slower than more modern idea writing.
[01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:14.540]   Um, but it was a good book and I liked that it was a signed copy.
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:15.420]   It made me feel connected.
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:16.180]   All right.
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:19.340]   Final book I read was, uh, Lee Bargo's.
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:21.420]   Is that how you spell her name?
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.340]   I feel like I have that wrong.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:23.900]   Ninth house.
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:26.340]   Can you look that up, Jesse, the book ninth house.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:27.860]   I want to make sure I'm saying her name right.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.460]   This was a novel.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:34.580]   So I started reading this up at Dartmouth because this is about Yale, but it's about,
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:41.780]   uh, what if the secret societies at Yale actually had knew how to do magic.
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:44.900]   And it was like dark kind of bad magic.
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:48.340]   And so all these societies were hiding all this magic and there's like a murder
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:51.660]   mystery and the main character is part of this house.
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:53.980]   It's supposed to just supervise the other houses.
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:58.180]   Um, and it's like, it's a, it turns out this is a genre called dark university.
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:59.140]   I was like, this is cool.
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:00.100]   We're up at Dartmouth.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:02.020]   Dartmouth has a secret societies.
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:06.340]   We were showing the boys the tombs, which is a secret society.
[01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:10.900]   Uh, there's a concrete Egyptian tomb.
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:12.820]   And it's unclear how you even get in.
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:15.460]   And it's like one of the secret societies at Dartmouth, you get tapped to be in the
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:20.420]   tombs and then you go do secret things in this building and you know, um, oh, uh,
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:22.500]   Bardugo, I said that wrong.
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.460]   Lee Bardugo.
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:24.180]   Sorry about that.
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:25.780]   I thought that would be cool.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:28.380]   Like a thriller set in Ivy league school and has magic.
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.940]   I want to get ready for Halloween, you know?
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.180]   And so it was cool.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:32.220]   It's here's the thing.
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:33.660]   I don't know these genres very well.
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:34.740]   It is very dark.
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:39.340]   So the main character of this book, um, a young woman who can see ghost.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:42.100]   Gets beat the hell.
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:45.220]   I mean, all throughout this book, I guess that's just part of the genre, but just
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:48.500]   as sometimes as ghosts doing it, sometimes it's people doing it.
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.020]   I mean, she's always getting slammed into things and beat.
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.820]   It's a weird, I guess that's just part of the genre.
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:59.940]   It's like they, they, um, materialized trauma into like big, obvious physical
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:05.140]   trauma as a way of, I don't know, but I like the magic systems in the plot.
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.380]   And it was, it was kind of cool.
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.900]   It took Yale and made it into this really dark thing.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.300]   It gave me an idea for a similar book for Dartmouth.
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:12.940]   So I want to plant this mind.
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:17.780]   If there's any dark university novelist who went to Dartmouth, I think it'd be,
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:21.100]   you could, you could definitely have a book that went back and forth.
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.580]   Between the founding of Dartmouth.
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:29.580]   So this is in the 17, uh, sixties when Eliezer Wheelock was, they were there.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.540]   This was just dark woods by the Connecticut.
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.740]   There was like a road that went through here in one Tavern and they were here
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:40.580]   trying to cut down these trees and build a log cabin, the start Dartmouth in the
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:43.940]   middle of the New Hampshire, New Hampshire woods, middle of nowhere.
[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:48.860]   Can't you imagine a book where you're telling that story and something dark
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:52.380]   happens, you know, like they come across some sort of like dark evil.
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:54.620]   And then the other part of it is modern day.
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:58.620]   And someone's like uncovering on the Dartmouth campus, a modern student, the,
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:02.460]   the clues that have been left behind by Eliezer Wheelock and you know, the, the
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:06.020]   old buildings and inside Bartlett tower and you go back and forth and there's
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:07.580]   some sort of like dark magic that's released.
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:08.620]   There we go.
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:10.340]   So someone should write that book.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:14.700]   So Leah Bardugo who wrote ninth house and she went to Yale.
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:17.060]   So she's sort of like really drawing from her experience there.
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:18.900]   So there you go.
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:21.580]   That's what I read in August.
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:21.820]   All right.
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:22.620]   That's a lot of books.
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:27.100]   By my count, we've talked about, and I'm looking at my number here, all the books.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:29.620]   I think that's the right summary of how many books we talked about today.
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:32.580]   So I don't know, go buy some books, be inspired.
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:36.740]   Uh, we'll be back next week with another episode, maybe with a few less books to
[01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:41.820]   talk about, or maybe even more, but until then, as always stay deep.
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:44.900]   Hey, it's Cal here.
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:50.260]   If you'd like this discussion today about ideas for deeper living, then I
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:57.700]   think you'll also like episode 252, where I lay out the details of my deep life
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:00.980]   stack, but I thought this would be a great time to beta test my, my more
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:02.860]   complete understanding of the deep life.
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:04.580]   So we'll call today's deep question.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:10.620]   How do I rebuild my life into something deeper?
