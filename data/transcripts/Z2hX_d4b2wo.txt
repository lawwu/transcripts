[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.760]   - Pastor John recently led a Q&A with the students
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.660]   of Westminster Seminary in Philadelphia.
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.920]   Here's one question from one of the students.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.680]   - Hello, Dr. John Piper.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.080]   I became Reformed after hearing you preach
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.960]   through John chapter six, 2009, I believe it was.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.680]   So I probably wouldn't even be here at Westminster.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.520]   I wouldn't even have thought about this school
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.680]   if it wasn't for just listening to you.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.360]   So I'm very much indebted to you.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.560]   - You're welcome, Westminster.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.800]   (laughing)
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.320]   - Just keeping in thinking along the lines
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200]   of what you said this morning,
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.680]   I was very intrigued by you unpacking TULIP
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.800]   and connecting it to just racial harmony.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.240]   One of my goals in ministry is I think about doing theology.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.480]   I want to connect, I want to bring Reformed theology
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.080]   to African Americans, black people.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.040]   And one of the issues I'm thinking about is
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.400]   how does Reformed theology speak to certain issues,
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.320]   cultural issues in the black community?
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.440]   Some would say that we're going through
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.520]   a cultural crisis right now.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.280]   High unemployment, high abortion rates,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.480]   a ton of things, crime rates through the roof,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.200]   and certain issues that I want to speak to prophetically.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.400]   And I'm wondering, I haven't thought about this
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.520]   because I've only been Reformed for a few years
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.160]   and I'm still growing in my theology
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.560]   and kind of thinking through the implications of it.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.760]   But you've been Reformed a lot longer than me,
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.720]   so probably you have more thoughts on this.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.160]   Can Reformed theology speak to specific cultural issues
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.160]   that would you advise a budding, I guess, theologian
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.960]   to address specific cultural issues
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.200]   or maybe just preach the gospel
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.800]   and as people change, the issues kind of address,
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.480]   get addressed from a different perspective?
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.280]   How fruitful would you say Reformed theology is
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.240]   to addressing particular issues?
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.080]   And can we expect to see real cultural change
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.360]   from an endeavor like that, if it's even worth taking on?
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.640]   Is my question clear?
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.080]   - Yeah, it's totally worth taking on.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.080]   And the grain of truth in the prosperity theology,
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.880]   the grain of truth in health, wealth, prosperity theology
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.400]   is that when the gospel takes root in a community,
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.560]   it changes everything.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.120]   You know, it changes everything.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.120]   Over the generations, a robust embrace of the gospel
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.400]   and its fullest and most biblical expression
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.360]   in Reformed theology will lift people out of poverty
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.440]   because the roots of poverty are moral roots.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.760]   I mean, I watch it in my city.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.800]   I live in the city, I look at the kids.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.000]   I know why these kids are gonna blow it.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.200]   Mom and dad aren't there, right?
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.520]   It's just not rocket science.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.200]   Look at the kids at Hope Academy
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.840]   and long for them to have anybody at home
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.200]   to say, "Do your homework."
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.880]   Because if you just do your homework, you'll flourish.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.600]   You'll probably go to college.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.360]   You'll be able to make a life.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.000]   And if you go home and you just watch TV
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.520]   and go out and goof off, you won't.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.880]   It's a dead end street.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.360]   But there's, I mean, the whole substructure
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.040]   that's there in the middle class
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.760]   to support efforts at success, where did those come from?
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.440]   They came from John Calvin and the Apostle Paul
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.000]   and the Geneva commitments.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   The Reformed Protestant work ethic
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   didn't come out of nowhere.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   So the grain of truth in prosperity preaching
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.160]   is not that he'll put gold rings
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.040]   and best cars in everybody's hands,
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.000]   but that he will transform the substructure
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.120]   of the way we think about life
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.560]   so that we don't shoot ourselves in the foot
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.640]   so often in life.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.720]   And so my answer is absolutely yes.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.720]   Every problem, Reformed theology is relevant
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.640]   for every problem in every ethnicity
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.280]   of every stress and stripe.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.760]   And the gospel is the core of it.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.800]   And I think the way you should think
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.040]   about Reformed theology in the gospel
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.960]   is that the gospel of Christ crucified and risen,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.680]   providing a righteousness we don't have,
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.680]   providing forgiveness we can't earn through faith alone
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.240]   is gloriously powerful when it addresses people
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.440]   who are the most broken,
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.680]   people who think they have not a prayer in the world
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.040]   to be right with God, let alone anybody else.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.880]   And Reformed theology are the deepest roots of that
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.560]   and the highest branches of that
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.160]   and the farthest extent of that
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.200]   and the best expression of that
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.840]   and the kind of whole counsel of God
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.000]   that surrounds and protects that.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And so you focus on the gospel into broken people's lives
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.120]   and then you have resources out here
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.600]   in all this Reformed theology
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.080]   to bring to bear on the peculiar stresses
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.960]   they bring to life.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.640]   And it is, it is totally relevant.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.040]   And the answer to the question, I think,
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.880]   about whether you just focus on the gospel
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.280]   or whether you tackle some of these things
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.120]   is you won't have a choice, right?
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.360]   I mean, the urban situation with a church
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.080]   full of unemployed, poor people, you have no choice.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.040]   You can't say, oh, we don't deal with that here.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.880]   It's over.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.280]   That's life.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.200]   That's real life.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.160]   Are they gonna eat?
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   So we don't, we middle-class wealthy folks,
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.320]   we can sort of think that way.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.320]   Like, we'll just preach the gospel
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.320]   because all the presuppositions of prosperity are in place.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.040]   Kind of unspoken, being fed.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.800]   With a community that's been broken.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.000]   And we've gotta be so careful.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   We're talking about African-American situation here
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.640]   because lots of books are being written right now
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.360]   that there is no such thing as black in America anymore.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.200]   There are blacks, right?
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.080]   There are 50 black cultures in America.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.040]   So you can't say the black situation
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.800]   or the African-American situation.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   But the most dysfunctional core of fatherlessness, say,
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.800]   that is addressable wonderfully by the gospel.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.080]   There is no other address.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.360]   I mean, everything else has been tried, right?
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.680]   Everything else has been tried.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.640]   Obamacare is not the solution.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.120]   And neither was the Great Society.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.920]   Neither was anything else that any president's ever brought.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.920]   War on poverty has never made a substantial difference.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.080]   Whereas the gospel has lifted many people
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.960]   from the brokenness of their family,
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.800]   brokenness of their own personal heart.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.800]   So more power to anybody who attempts to take on
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.680]   whatever aspects of American culture
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.880]   are presently broken and dysfunctional.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.960]   Focus on the gospel, but yes, the Reformed theology
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.520]   as its larger expression and root and branch
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.000]   is an amazing resource for what you're gonna deal with.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.440]   - That clip was taken from Pastor John's
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.280]   recent interactions with the students
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.840]   of Westminster Seminary.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.760]   And speaking of the social impact
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.000]   of the gospel Reformed theology in John Calvin,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.760]   see Marvin Alasky's lecture,
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.600]   The Secular Script in the Theater of God,
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.240]   which was delivered at the 2009
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.960]   Desiring God National Conference on John Calvin.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.480]   It was also later published as a chapter in our book titled
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.120]   "With Calvin in the Theater of God."
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.680]   The lecture and the book can both be found free of charge
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.480]   at our website, desiringgod.org.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.160]   And if you'd like to ask Pastor John a question of your own,
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.960]   please email it to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.480]   As always, thank you for sending in thoughtful
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.960]   and great questions.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960]   And thank you for listening.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.160]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.740]   (upbeat music)
