[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.920]   - Well this is the season for questions and controversies.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.920]   And yesterday we talked with a historian
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.840]   about the historical debate over whether or not
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.280]   Herod the Great really did slaughter
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.160]   all of the baby boys in Bethlehem
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.840]   or whether the story is a nativity fiction.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.960]   Today we talk about a cultural debate over Santa Claus.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.520]   Of course, this is the season for Santa Claus questions
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.320]   here at Ask Pastor John.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.660]   And we have over 50 questions on the topic
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.560]   in our inbox.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.880]   Now of course, Pastor John, as you know,
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.920]   there's a fourth century Greek historical figure
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.960]   named Saint Nicholas, but most of the questions,
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.700]   I think all of the questions that we have received
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.680]   are about the mythical, white bearded, red suited,
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.400]   reindeer flying Santa Claus, that one.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.920]   Corbin from Gainesville, Georgia writes in to ask this,
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.880]   "Pastor John, should parents allow their children
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.220]   "to believe Santa Claus is bringing them gifts
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.880]   "on Christmas?"
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.200]   So cut it straight, Pastor John,
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.240]   what would you say about Santa Claus?
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.860]   - After Easter, Christmas should be the happiest day
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.980]   of the year in Christian worship.
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.060]   The reason I say after Easter is that Good Friday
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.740]   and Easter is the goal of Christmas.
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.100]   The death and resurrection, the salvation of sinners
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.540]   through the death and resurrection of Jesus
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.580]   is the goal of Christmas.
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.700]   Christmas is not the goal of Easter.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460]   Christmas is a means.
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.460]   The salvation of sinners on Good Friday
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.180]   and Easter is the goal.
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.640]   Jesus came at Christmas to seek and to save the lost,
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.720]   Luke 19.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.720]   Jesus came at Christmas to save sinners, 1 Timothy 1:15.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.540]   Jesus came at Christmas to give his life a ransom
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.860]   for many, Mark 10.
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.600]   Jesus came at Christmas not to call the righteous
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.340]   but sinners, Matthew 9.
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.200]   Jesus came at Christmas to destroy the works of the devil,
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.400]   1 John 3.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.520]   Jesus came at Christmas that through death
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.680]   he might destroy the one who has the power of death,
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.720]   Hebrews 2:14.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.980]   So the birth of the Son of God, the very God, very man,
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.320]   is simply stunning and glorious and infinitely serious
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.480]   and overflowing with happy news.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.480]   The angel called it good news of great joy, great joy.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.960]   Not small joy, not a little bit of joy, but great joy.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.320]   So my question is this.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.320]   How could we possibly even think of giving our children
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.160]   a bowl of bland, sugarless porridge
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.020]   when they are offered the greatest meal in the world?
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.060]   Why would we give them Santa Claus
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.700]   when they can have the incarnation of the Son of God?
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.700]   I mean, it's just mind-boggling to me
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.780]   that any Christian would even contemplate such a trade,
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.680]   that we would divert attention away
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.980]   from the incarnation of the God of the universe
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.400]   into this world to save us and our children in order to,
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.020]   I mean, I can scarcely have words for it
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.420]   that people would contemplate this.
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.220]   Not only is Santa Claus not true,
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.580]   and Jesus is very truth himself,
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.540]   but compared to Jesus, Santa is simply pitiful,
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.940]   and our kids should be helped to see this.
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.860]   Santa Claus offers only earthly things,
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.660]   nothing lasting, nothing eternal.
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.740]   Jesus offers eternal joy with the world thrown in.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.380]   Yeah, the fire engine is thrown in.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.860]   Santa Claus offers his ephemeral goodies
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.660]   only on the condition of good works.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.860]   He knows when you are, he knows when you've been bad
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.140]   or good to be good, for goodness sakes.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.020]   That's a pure works religion,
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.440]   and Jesus offers himself all the gifts freely
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.860]   by grace for faith.
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.920]   Santa Claus is make-believe.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.700]   Jesus is more real than the roof on your house.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.620]   Santa Claus, he only shows up once a year.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.180]   Jesus promises, "I'll be with you always."
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.100]   You say to your kid, "Every night, every night,
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.200]   "he's standing by your bed.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.400]   "He's with you when you get up in the morning.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.520]   "He's with you when you go to school today.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.700]   "If Mommy and Daddy die, he will be right there with you."
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.700]   Santa doesn't hold a candle to this flaming Jesus.
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.100]   Santa Claus cannot solve our worst problem,
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.100]   and Jesus did solve our worst problem,
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.680]   our sin and our alienation from God.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.560]   Santa Claus, he can put some icing on the cake
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.340]   of the good life, but he cannot take a shattered life
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.180]   and rebuild it with hope forever,
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.300]   and our kids need to know that about Christmas.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.780]   Santa Claus is not relevant in many cultures of the world,
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.460]   and Jesus is the King of kings and Lord of lords
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.860]   in all the peoples of the world.
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.900]   Santa Claus will be forgotten someday,
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.060]   and Jesus will be the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.980]   So, Tony, there is no contest here.
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.980]   So I cannot see why a parent, if they know and love Jesus,
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.780]   if they have found Jesus to be the greatest treasure
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.420]   in the world, why they would bring Jesus
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.520]   out of the celebration and Santa
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.660]   into the celebration at all.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.700]   I mean, he's just irrelevant.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.060]   He has nothing to do with it.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.780]   He's zero.
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.860]   So my counsel is to give all your efforts
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.580]   to making your children as happy as they can possibly be
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.000]   with every kind of surprise that is rooted
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.880]   in the true meaning of Christmas.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.300]   Let your decorations point to Jesus.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.960]   Let your food point to Jesus.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.640]   Let your games point to Jesus.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.380]   Let your singing point to Jesus.
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.820]   Out rejoice the world.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.500]   Out give the world.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.460]   Out decorate the world, and let it all point to Jesus.
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.460]   If being Jesus-focused is a killjoy for your Christmas,
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.380]   you don't know him well.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.580]   Wow, that is cutting it straight.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.180]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.420]   And with a bang, that marks our 760th episode
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.920]   that we have released as we near the end
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.260]   of our third full year.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.500]   And wow, we look back, and that's a lot of grace
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.500]   shown to Pastor John into this podcast.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.940]   What an honor to be a part of this team
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.420]   and to be working on this podcast.
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.700]   Thank you, listeners, for making this podcast
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.660]   a part of your life.
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.040]   We can do what we do because you are engaged,
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.500]   and you listen, and you share the content with your friends,
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.020]   and because you send us great questions,
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.180]   and not to mention all the other dimensions
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.020]   of the ministry of Desiring God,
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.260]   which include initiatives like this daily podcast
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.300]   and all the daily content we publish online
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.420]   at desiringgod.org.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.020]   It is all made possible by the prayers
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.900]   and the financial generosity of our friends
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.180]   who love what we do.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.540]   So as we near the end of 2015,
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.160]   we wanna take a moment to thank everyone
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.860]   who supports our work,
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.780]   because behind the incredible 60% growth in web traffic
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.780]   we have seen at Desiring God in 2015 is a lot of labor.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.580]   And behind that labor are the prayerful financial donors
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.420]   around the world, listeners like you who give monthly
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.900]   or who give near the end of the year.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.180]   We thank you.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.500]   And we invite you to join them and to partner with us
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.100]   in this work as we launch into 2016.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.100]   You can go to desiringgod.org and click on the Donate tab
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.620]   at the top of the page.
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.380]   Your financial support is greatly appreciated by us
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.660]   and all who listen to this program free of charge.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.660]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.140]   Thanks for listening, and thanks for supporting
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.860]   the Ask Pastor John podcast.
