[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   - Again, an unanswerable question.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.360]   Why do you think our world is so easily compressible
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.820]   into beautiful equations?
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.060]   - Yeah, I mean, like I just hinted at,
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.240]   I don't know if there's an answer to that question.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.400]   There could be.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.160]   - What would an answer look like?
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.720]   - Well, an answer could look like
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.600]   if you showed that there was something about our world
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.120]   that maximized something, you know,
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.440]   the mean of the simplicity and the powerfulness
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.080]   of the laws of physics, or, you know,
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.080]   maybe we're just generic,
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.640]   maybe in a set of all possible worlds,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.160]   this is what the world would look like, right?
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.960]   Like, I don't really know.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.720]   I tend to think not.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.160]   I tend to think that there is something specific
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.640]   and rock bottom about the facts of our world
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.320]   that don't have further explanation.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.480]   Like the fact that the world exists at all,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.160]   and furthermore, the specific laws of physics that we have.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.920]   I think that in some sense, we're just gonna,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.720]   at some level, we're gonna say, and that's how it is,
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.720]   and, you know, we can't explain anything more.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.080]   I don't know how, if we're anywhere close to that right now,
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.360]   but that seems plausible to me.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.920]   - And speaking of rock bottom,
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.760]   one of the things sort of your book
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.440]   kind of reminded me or revealed to me
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.320]   is that what's fundamental and what's emergent,
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.600]   it just feels like I don't even know anymore
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.680]   what's fundamental in physics, if there's anything.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.440]   It feels like everything,
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.120]   especially with quantum mechanics is revealing to us
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.360]   is that most interesting things that I would,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.360]   as a limited human would think are fundamental
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.200]   can actually be explained as emergent
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.200]   from the more deeper laws.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.360]   - I mean, we don't know, of course.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.760]   You had to get that on the table.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.400]   We don't know what is fundamental.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.720]   We do know, we do have reason to say
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.440]   that certain things are more fundamental than others, right?
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.400]   Atoms and molecules are more fundamental
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.000]   than cells and organs.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.500]   Quantum fields are more fundamental
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.840]   than atoms and molecules.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.160]   We don't know if that ever bottoms out.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.760]   I do think that there's sensible ways to think about this.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.080]   If you describe something like this table as a table,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.440]   it has a height and a width
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.840]   and it's made of a certain material
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.800]   and it has a certain solidity and weight and so forth,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.200]   that's a very useful description as far as it goes.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.600]   There's a whole nother description of this table
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.760]   in terms of a whole collection of atoms
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.920]   strung together in certain ways.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.400]   The language of the atoms is more comprehensive
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.640]   than the language of the table.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.520]   You could break apart the table, smash it to pieces,
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.380]   still talk about it as atoms,
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.180]   but you could no longer talk about it as a table, right?
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.840]   So I think of this comprehensiveness,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.160]   the domain of validity of a theory
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.320]   gets broader and broader
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.520]   as the theory gets more and more fundamental.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.840]   Okay.
