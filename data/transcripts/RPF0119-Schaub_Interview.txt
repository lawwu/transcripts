[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.360]   me this morning. Thank you, Joshua. I'm happy to be here. I brought you on to discuss one of my
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.120]   favorite topics and topic that you're an expert in, which is real estate. I've got some specific
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.720]   lines of questioning that I want to pursue, but would you start by sharing a little bit of your
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.120]   background with real estate, how you got into it, and what your experience has been over the
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.600]   decades as a real estate investor? Yeah. Well, I got into it. I had, as a kid, like many folks did,
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.000]   had several different jobs. I worked in restaurants. I worked in construction. I went to
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.920]   college. While I was in college, I managed an apartment building, and I got lucky one day,
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.240]   a guy came along and wanted to buy it, so I sold it to him. I collected my first commission back
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.200]   when I was in college. So, I got my real estate license early, and I was in the brokerage business
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.680]   for a few years, but decided I didn't like the brokerage business, and then started investing
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.800]   back in the early '70s. I still have the first property that I ever bought, bought in 1973. I
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.120]   still own it. Through trial and error over the last 40 years, I've been buying and managing
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.680]   properties and learning which ones were the easiest to manage, and which ones made me the
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.280]   most money, and which ones had the least amount of risk, and gave me the best lifestyle. I'm kind
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.240]   of a lifestyle guy. I'm in favor of owning properties free and clear. We pay cash for
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.160]   our house, and we bought it back in 1980-something. I've encouraged kids. I wrote a book back in the
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.040]   '80s called "How to Own the House of Your Dreams Free and Clear." So, I'm a guy who likes to be
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.320]   free of debt, but I do understand leverage, and there is a safe way to borrow money in the real
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.600]   estate business. There is safe leverage, and I know it's hard to accumulate a lot of money without
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.280]   using some kind of leverage, but you have to have your head on straight about it. There are some
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.320]   people who are just totally anti-leverage, and I respect that, but it is very hard to accumulate a
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.200]   large capital base unless you use some leverage to start with. So, that's it in a nutshell. Today,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.040]   I own and manage my own properties. At one time, I had a lot more property, and I had a large staff.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.520]   Today, I operate just my wife and myself, just the two of us, and we manage our own properties,
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.400]   and it gives us quite a lot of freedom. We travel a lot. My daughter lives in Australia,
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.240]   so we're in Australia quite a bit, and I can manage my properties today from any place in the
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.160]   world because I have good long-term tenants, and it's like family. Everybody likes everybody.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.160]   Everybody benefits from being a part of a group here. People who live in my houses, I own nothing
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.720]   but houses. The people who live in my houses want to live in my houses. They respect the houses.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.920]   They respect me, so we don't have any big issues, and that's totally different from where I started.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.720]   I started off buying apartments and duplexes and commercial buildings and all sorts of
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.840]   different kinds of income properties, and I can tell you that end of the business is a constant
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.920]   battle because people are always coming and going, which requires you to work a lot as a landlord,
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.520]   and then the other side of it is many of them are trying to beat you out of your money,
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.160]   and they negotiate all the time, so you're fighting with folks, and that's not a situation
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.000]   I'm in today at all. We have team players as tenants, and if they don't want to be on the team,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   it's not a problem. They can leave, but the only people that live in my houses are team players
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.640]   who respect the property, who respect me, who pay on time, who take care of the property,
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.080]   and who stay for a very long time. My average tenant stays eight or ten years, so
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.320]   that makes life better, and that's a different model than most people are used to. Most people
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.800]   think of landlords as somebody who's charging too much rent and extracting too much for folks
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.600]   and taking advantage of them, and that's not our game plan at all, so that's it in a nutshell.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:40.080]   You must be one of the leading champions of at least the advantages of single-family housing.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.560]   I remember the first book of yours that I ever read was Building Wealth One House at a Time,
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.960]   and it really, I thought you made a compelling case for single-family housing versus other
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.800]   forms of real estate. What would cause somebody to look at other forms of real estate instead of
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.920]   single-family housing, though? You just made a little bit of the case for it, but what would
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.400]   send someone in the direction of looking at apartment buildings or other ways of investing?
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.520]   Well, if you had a lot of money, if you're trying to invest billions of dollars,
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.440]   the hedge funds are investing billions of dollars in houses now, but this is the first time I've
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.160]   ever seen that kind of money come into the house market, and they won't stay in it very long
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.800]   because the management style that they are using is not going to work for them. Their expenses are
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.240]   going to be a lot higher than they projected, and they're going to have a lot more turnover
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.560]   than they thought because they don't operate like I do. They don't have this team. They're
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.640]   trying to extract as much money as they can from their tenants, and that's not a good plan long
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:45.040]   term. But I have owned other property, and if I had to invest $50 million in a year, I wouldn't
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:51.200]   buy houses. I'd have to go out and buy something bigger, probably land or maybe a large-income
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.960]   property that would be professionally managed. But for the little guy getting started,
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.680]   I started with no money. I was a little guy. I didn't inherit a bunch of money or anything, so
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.280]   when I started buying property, I had to buy with a relatively small down payment, $500,
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.680]   $1,000 down and find somebody who would finance it for me because the banks wouldn't let me any
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.240]   money. And I learned over the years that there are a lot of people that would do that, that would
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.840]   finance a purchase of a property, and especially people who didn't want properties. And some of
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.680]   those, of course, were kind of rough. They needed work. They were harder to manage. So if you wanted
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.640]   to get started in this business, you can buy all the run-down houses and duplexes and apartment
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.760]   buildings you want that are mismanaged. You can buy those properties easily with owner financing
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:41.360]   today, but they're a job. It takes a lot of work to manage those. So the key long-term,
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:47.040]   your strategy long-term, if you want a good lifestyle, is to end up with some properties
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:53.520]   that sort of self-manage. And I don't want anybody to believe that there's no work at all involved
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.440]   here, but I can do everything I need to do to manage my properties with my cell phone from
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.160]   Australia. And I do it with email. I don't even have to talk to folks. So if something breaks,
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.600]   it's easy to email somebody and get it fixed. And somebody does move out when I'm far, far,
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.240]   far away. The house just is empty for a month until I come back, but that's part of the price
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.000]   I pay for my lifestyle, and I can live with that. But I resist the temptation to get into bigger
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.200]   properties for a couple of reasons. One is liquidity. If you look around most markets
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.400]   today, you'll find there's still quite a bit of empty commercial building. And same thing with
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.560]   office space. And these buildings sometimes become obsolete. The markets change, and there's no need
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.080]   for them. So it's not unusual to see a building sit empty for a year or two, or even somebody
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.480]   tear down a 10-year-old commercial building just because it's obsolete. A house is a whole
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.360]   different animal. And if you buy houses in neighborhoods that are stable and improving,
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.160]   those houses will probably be there 50 years from now. And there's neighborhoods in most
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.320]   towns that have been there 50 years, and some of those neighborhoods are getting better and better.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.840]   So I tend to buy in those neighborhoods. It's certainly a simpler way to buy real estate.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:10.800]   And again, for the person who's getting started and wants to own maybe five or 10 income properties
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.280]   that'll produce enough income to support their lifestyle, it just makes more sense to me.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:23.360]   If you're sitting down having a cup of coffee with a bright, energetic, young high school graduate or
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.040]   college student, and this young man or woman is saying to you, "Mr. Schaub, can you give me some
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.880]   advice of how I can be rich and financially independent like you?" What would be the path
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.000]   that you would lay out for this person of how to go from nothing to wealth?
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.080]   Well, if you're going to do it in real estate, one of the keys is management.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.320]   So you have to learn how to manage people, how to talk to people, how to recognize folks who are
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.760]   going to do business with you if you're buying property, and how to recognize a good tenant,
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.720]   and then how to attract that potential tenant. So probably it wouldn't be a bad idea. I have
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.640]   three children, by the way, so I've given this advice before. It wouldn't be a bad idea to get
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.440]   involved in some business where you're managing other people and develop that skill, because that's
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.400]   a very valuable skill. From a real estate perspective, it's important to know where
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.720]   you're going to be. Buying property far away from where you're going to live is not a good plan.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.120]   So you have to -- and the challenge I think most young people have is they're not sure where they're
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.720]   going to live for the next 10 years or who they're going to live with, and a lot of things are going
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   to change in their lives. So for most people, probably I wouldn't recommend that a 20-year-old
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   go out and buy property unless they were confident that this is the town they're going to stay in
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.560]   for the next five or 10 years. Because if you buy it and have to sell it next year,
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.800]   you're probably not going to make any money. But once you establish that, then
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:53.360]   a systematic accumulation of good properties -- if I look at the mistakes I've made,
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.120]   and I've made many mistakes, it's generally buying something that didn't turn out to be
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:04.160]   a good property from a management standpoint, or that I thought it was in a path of progress,
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:09.680]   and progress never came, or I got involved with some bad financing. So I teach people,
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:17.120]   when I teach classes or I teach people the danger and the advantages of borrowing money.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.000]   But you have to be careful when you borrow money. People get excited about asset protection,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.800]   about getting sued, but very few people go broke because they get sued. A lot of people go broke
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.600]   because they borrow money and can't pay it back. So debt is the enemy. That's what you have to
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.200]   worry about and understand. And once you know how to use that properly, then it's a terrific tool
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:46.400]   for you. When someone is getting started learning about real estate, my experience in the real
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:52.320]   estate education business has been that there are a lot of scam artists selling information
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.960]   that may or may not be accurate. How can someone who's interested in learning learn to detect
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:05.520]   the scam artist information versus the solid information from wise and experienced investors?
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:14.240]   And that's a good question because you're absolutely right. There are a lot of smooth
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.200]   talkers out there who are not actually in the real estate business, don't actually own anything,
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:26.160]   but they will sell you their system or their idea. And generally, one sign is they'll charge a lot
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:33.040]   of money for it. I've been teaching seminars for nearly 40 years and I think the most I've ever
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.960]   taught charged for a seminar, for a three-day seminar, is about $600, about $200 a day.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.640]   So if you find someone that's charging you thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars,
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.720]   you know, $20,000 or $30,000 for some secret, they're just ripping you off.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:53.680]   There's a lot of legitimate education taught by people who are really in the business who
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.040]   don't charge that much because they don't have to. It's not their main business. They're not
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.720]   paying somebody a large commission to get you in the door. I would think that unless you have a
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:08.240]   referral from somebody who has heard somebody speak and thinks that they're legitimate and
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.240]   thinks that they know what they're talking about, I certainly wouldn't write a check.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.320]   I might go listen to somebody, but my advice to people if they're going to some of these
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.560]   come-on seminars, you know, free seminars, is to leave your checkbook at home because
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.240]   they have some very good salesmen in the back of the room at those seminars. And I've seen them
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.000]   sign people up for credit cards and then book their credit cards for thousands of dollars.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.240]   Those are common. So stay away from those outfits. There's a lot of great books written on real
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.800]   estate investment. I mean, one of the first ones I read was Bill Nickerson's book, "How I Turned
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:44.640]   $1,000 Into $1,000,000 in My Spare Time." And he's rewritten that. It goes dead now, but he and I
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.360]   shared the same birthday. We were friends years ago. Jay DeSima's written some good books. Donald
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.840]   Trump's first book, "The Art of the Deal," is good. Bill Secondor's book is good. I think my book is
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:00.960]   good. Al Lowry, who was Bill's partner for a while, wrote a couple good books. And Bob Ross
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.960]   wrote some good books. He's a student of mine. Bob Allen is a student of mine. He's written a
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.880]   couple good books, and I'm going to call nothing down. So there's a lot of stuff you can read out
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:14.480]   there that'll get you started. But then it's trial and error. I mean, the lessons you're going to
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.800]   learn the best are when you make a mistake and it costs you $1,000. I can talk to you about the
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.120]   mistakes I've made. They cost me a lot more than that. And you'll probably remember some of it,
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:31.760]   but when you make a mistake, you will remember. So the answer is that you have to get into the
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.760]   field. You have to go out and take some chances. And that's why I've always encouraged people to
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:41.920]   take small chances. I taught a class for years I called "Making it Big on Little Deals." And I
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.960]   explained to people that you're much better off doing five little deals a year than one big one,
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.240]   because you're going to make some mistakes in there, but the chances are pretty good if you
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.480]   make five deals. If one or two of them will turn out really good, and then if the three other ones
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.760]   are not very good and you're just beginning, that they don't cost you much money. You don't lose
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.000]   much money. You're still in business. But if you get into one big deal and it goes bad, you're
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.360]   probably done.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:13.440]   The real estate education industry, I remember when I was in college, I went to a seminar,
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.760]   and it was a Russ Whitney seminar. And I didn't know what I was doing at the time,
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:26.160]   but I just remember being so hot under the collar to sign up for the $35,000 coaching package.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.880]   And I was at the back of the room, ready to put it on a credit card. And they're like,
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.080]   "You got to do it now." Well, I had to, "No, I got to wait." And thankfully, I'm so thankful,
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.960]   one of the biggest, it would have been one of the biggest financial mistakes I ever made.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.800]   Thankfully, I let my dad talk me out of it, and he talked a little sense into me. I'm so grateful
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:48.320]   to him now that he did so. But just that, there's something about the real estate industry where
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.680]   it seems as though people take the statistic and say, "More people have become self-made
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:58.000]   millionaires in real estate than just about anything else," which is probably true.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.920]   And they twist that into a sales seminar that is heavy on hype and low on density of information.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:12.000]   And I'm so thankful I avoided that now. But it's sobering to realize how close I was to
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.200]   wrecking my financial life at that stage in life.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   Well, keep spreading the word because high-priced education, and it's not just in the real estate
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:27.120]   business. I even think that some colleges are going the wrong direction, charging people
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:33.280]   more money than $35,000, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars for a degree that they can't
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:40.960]   use to get a job. People think just because they get education, they're going to get a paycheck.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:49.200]   Obviously, that's not true. So it's a challenge. It's a challenge. But again, I got all my college
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.440]   education in the public school system. I went to a junior college here in town. I went to University
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:18:00.720]   of Florida, both good schools, but a lot cheaper than going to some private school. And I feel
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.800]   like I've received a good education. And so I encourage kids. I've been on boards of schools.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:15.680]   I really encourage kids to get a good education at a reasonable price. And that's why I continue
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:21.920]   to teach. You mentioned leverage and the advantages and pitfalls. I'd like to come
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.480]   back and ask you to expand on that a little bit, because this is one of the biggest debates and
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:33.920]   concerns and questions that people face. How would you give an outline, a framework of a way to think
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.960]   about leverage and to appreciate the advantages of it and the disadvantages that would help somebody
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:45.040]   think through their situation and see what would be best for them? Well, I've written a lot on this,
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.720]   so it's going to be hard to condense it into two or three minute answer. But the short answer,
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.600]   I guess, is whenever you borrow money, first of all, I don't think you should borrow money unless
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.120]   you're buying investments. I don't think you should borrow money to live on. I don't think
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.600]   you should borrow money to buy a house to live in. I don't think you should borrow money to buy
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.840]   cars or get into credit card debt. I think personal debt is just an anchor. It's going to drag you
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:15.760]   down. So unless you can afford to buy that car for cash, unless you can afford to buy a toy or take
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:22.240]   a trip on cash, I'm against it. Now, I know that's not that popular. Most of the world operates on
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.440]   credit nowadays, and people who have jobs can pay those credit card bills back, but I've never been
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:33.760]   a fan of personal credit. On the other hand, investment credit's a different animal. If I
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.880]   find somebody who will sell me a house and will sell it to me with a down payment that I have
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:45.760]   today and will carry back a note, will carry back the financing with payments that I can afford to
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:51.120]   make with the rent I collect after paying my expenses, that's not a high-risk debt to me.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.560]   If I lose that house, and I will say I've never lost a house in a law like that, but if I did
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:01.360]   lose that house, I would simply give it back to the people I bought it from. They would probably
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.480]   be happy with that transaction, but they haven't been hurt. I mean, they keep my down payment.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:11.040]   They get their house back. They haven't been damaged, and the law is pretty clear on this.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.960]   If I finance a house, if I buy a house from you and say I buy a $100,000 house, and I give you
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:23.120]   $10,000 down, and you finance $90,000 for me, and the payments are going to be $500 a month,
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:29.040]   and I can afford to rent that house for maybe $950 and pay the taxes and insurance and maintenance
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.720]   and still have $500 left to pay you and maybe a little bit for myself, if I can't make those
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.360]   payments and give that house back, I don't owe you the $90,000. You've received the house back,
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:46.880]   so there's no debt to pursue there. So I see that kind of leverage as a totally different animal
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:52.640]   than either borrowing cash from a bank to go out and buy property or to borrow from a credit card
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:59.840]   company or a car dealer to buy a car or something else. So it's important that people understand
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:06.480]   that difference. If you go borrow cash and then use that cash to buy a house, it puts you under
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.280]   some pressure. I've seen people do that. I've seen people refinance maybe their personal residence or
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:16.960]   some other property they have, and now they have $50,000 cash in the bank, earning 0.6%,
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.920]   and they're under a lot of pressure to use that $50,000 cash to go out and buy something,
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.080]   and they're paying interest on that $50,000 cash. Well, that's not a strong strategy.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.160]   It's a much better strategy, and I will say something that will make sense to some of your
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.280]   listeners, not to all of them, that you make your best deals in this business not when you have a
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.320]   lot of money. You make your best deals in this business when you're broke, because when I find
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.120]   somebody who wants to sell a house and I want to buy that house but I don't have any money,
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.800]   the only option we have is for them to finance it for me, and they will. If I have $50,000,
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.760]   then I can give them $50,000, and that makes the deal maybe better for them, but it doesn't make
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:01.040]   it better for me. It puts me at higher risk. So when you're leveraging an investment property,
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.720]   and you've got to get your head around this, but the more you put down, the more you have a risk.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:13.520]   It is safer to buy that $100,000 house with $5,000 down than it is with $100,000 or $50,000
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:20.160]   down, because if I put $50,000 down, I have $50,000 I can lose, and if I mismanage it or
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.280]   something goes wrong with the real estate or something goes wrong with the real estate market,
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:28.320]   I have a lot more risk than I do with $5,000 down. I'll tell you a story. I've sold a bunch
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:34.160]   of properties here. I buy and sell. I mostly buy and hold, but we sold a property to a young man
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:40.240]   here a couple years ago before this last downturn. He paid me a price for it. It was a retail price
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:45.920]   at the time, and I financed the house for him, and then the prices of the houses dropped. In my
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.120]   town, they dropped almost in half in some areas. So this house went from about $250,000 to about
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:57.760]   $150,000 in value, and he came back to me and he said, "John, it's not worth $250,000 anymore.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.840]   He gave me a small down payment, and he owed me the money." And I said to him, "We'll make a deal.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.240]   Rather than you walking away from this, we'll adjust the payments so you can afford to keep
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.640]   making me the payments," because the house was rented and it was making money. But then we
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.080]   stretched out the loan so he could pay me back years down the road when prices went back up,
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.800]   and they had to come back up. So now he's got a profit in this house, and I'm going to recover
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.360]   my money at some point, and it's been a good deal for both of us. Well, that's a conversation
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.520]   that it was easy for me to have with somebody because I sold him that house and carried the
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:38.160]   financing. If he would have borrowed the money to buy that house from a bank and gone down to the
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.200]   bank and tried to have that conversation, it wouldn't have worked. He probably lost the house.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.160]   So there's some major advantages to learning how to do this right, and the people that do master
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.960]   the idea of buying property and having sellers finance it for them buy a lot of property,
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.120]   but they're not limited in how much they can buy, and they make money every time they buy something.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:04.560]   - You made an astounding statement in one of your books where you said that in many decades
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.920]   of investing in real estate, you've never borrowed money from a bank to buy property. Is that true?
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:16.960]   - It's absolutely true. It's absolutely true. If you've had that experience, if you've had
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.640]   experience of going down to a bank and borrowing money to buy a house, you know how aggravating
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:28.720]   that can be to start with. They want all your financial information, tax returns, and here's
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:34.240]   the really bad part. The paperwork you sign when you borrow money from a bank gives them a lot of
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:40.800]   power. They can weigh a lot of your rights. They don't even have to, that they can foreclose pretty
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:48.160]   much when they want to because if they feel like they're collateral is in jeopardy or you're not
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:53.040]   maintaining the house for a lot of little reasons, they can foreclose if they want to. Now, as a
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.880]   practical matter, banks don't want houses that are not going to foreclose unless you stop making
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:03.760]   the payments most of the time, but it puts you at risk. And also, you know, in a state like Florida
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:09.360]   and a lot of states that do have personal liability when you borrow money, the bank,
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.320]   you can get what's called a deficiency judgment. You know, if you borrow 200,000 for a month and
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   your house sells for 150, and most times, there's been some unusual times lately, but most times you
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.960]   would still owe that other $50,000 and the banks would pursue you for it. So if you had a savings
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:30.000]   account or other assets, they wouldn't forgive that $50,000. They would make you pay it back.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.640]   So it's the most dangerous money you can borrow from a bank. And because of paperwork and, you
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:42.160]   know, the other part, if you're an investor and you own a lot of properties, you may not want to
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.040]   buy a bank statement every time you buy a house and show them everything you have. I certainly
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.200]   wouldn't. So in all my years, I've never borrowed money from a bank to buy a house.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:59.280]   My listener base of this show varies from very experienced to very new. And so to the experienced
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:05.040]   people, what you just said would sound fairly normal. And I recognize that I think real estate
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:10.640]   financing strategies is better taught with a book. But could you just mention to the listeners who,
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.280]   "That just sounds crazy. How can I buy houses without borrowing a bank?" Could you mention
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.240]   just a few of the ideas in general that have been helpful? You mentioned seller financing.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:27.440]   Just give a brief overview on seller financing to explain to somebody how that works. And then
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.080]   also some of maybe the other strategies that you can use to avoid borrowing from a bank.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:38.800]   Well, I'm looking at a house right now. I bought three houses this year. I'm looking at another
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:44.560]   one right now that folks have had for sale for more than a year. It's been empty for more than
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:50.160]   a year. Their mother owned it and the mother has moved far, far away now to live with the children
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.440]   in a different state. So they thought they were going to sell this house. Our market's pretty
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:01.040]   good right now. But they have not been able to sell it. And so I'm making them an offer,
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:08.560]   asking them to carry back the financing for the next 20 years. The mother is in her late 70s.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.120]   There's a good chance she's going to live 20 more years. And the fellow told me one time it's
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.200]   inconvenient to run out of money before you run out of life. You know, you're going to take a 10
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.680]   year loan if you're going to live 20 more years. You want that income to come in forever. So I'm
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:26.400]   going to make them an offer and asking them to finance that house over the next 20 years
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:33.440]   at today's interest rates. Now, a major advantage we have is today's interest rates, I think,
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:39.200]   are below what they should be. You know, when you can get a house loan, a 30 year house loan,
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.200]   for some place in the 4% range, that's unusually low. I've been doing this for a long time. And
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.520]   you go back and look at historical interest rates, back as far as you want to. They're all online,
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.800]   of course. And you'll see that 4% doesn't seem to be normal. Normal is more like 5% or 6% or 7%
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:02.000]   or 8%. So I think when you can borrow money at a rate like today's rate, 3% or 4%, it's a terrific
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.800]   deal. Well, if I can borrow money, if these people, and I'm not trying to, you know, understand,
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.800]   I'm not actually borrowing money. They're not lending me money here. What they're doing is
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.240]   financing the sale of this house. If they will finance the sale of this house for me with a 4%
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:21.840]   interest rate over the next 20 years and let me make a down payment that makes them comfortable,
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:27.360]   and you know, my first offer is going to be 5% down, but I'm willing to put up to 20% down if
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:34.720]   the deal works for them. But, you know, the reason people hesitate to finance sales of properties
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.920]   is one, they're not sure they're going to get paid back. Well, you can tell them stories about
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.000]   how you've lived in this town all your life and you've always paid your debts and they can check
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.080]   you out and that'll probably make them feel somewhat better. But what really makes them feel
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:54.080]   good is for you to put down a bigger down payment. So if I can afford to put down 10% or 15% or 20%,
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.720]   then they're pretty confident that after that kind of investment that they won't get the house back,
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.720]   that they won't get their payments every month for the next 20 years. Well, you know, you have
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:07.280]   to do the math now. You have to know what a house will rent for. You have to know what your expenses
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.960]   are going to be, your taxes and insurance, and then you have to estimate maintenance.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:18.000]   I would caution you not to buy houses that are in really poor shape. I like to buy houses that
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.520]   are in good shape. I buy houses sometimes that are brand new. I bought 20 or 30 brand new houses.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.040]   I bought a number of houses from folks who have rehabbed them and done a nice job.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:32.000]   If somebody has rehabbed the house, check it out carefully and make sure that they have done
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.960]   the wiring and the plumbing, up the code and the air conditioning, the heating, working on
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.560]   stuff so everything works well. Because sometimes people rehab things themselves and they'll cut a
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:48.960]   corner. You don't want to buy something that has a bad, bad wiring. But if you're buying a house
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:54.560]   in decent shape and you're buying it with payments that are low enough to cover it so you can rent
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.480]   it and your tenants can pay back the payments plus the taxes, insurance, and maintenance,
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:03.120]   and you can buy it with a relatively low down payment, your rate of return on your investment
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:10.240]   is good. I hold houses until they at least double one time in value. That's my policy.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:15.520]   Most houses I own have doubled two or three times in value. But if I buy something for the short
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:20.160]   term, and sometimes it takes seven or eight years, sometimes it takes 10 years for a house to double
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:26.000]   in value, if I buy a house with 10 or 20 percent down and I hold it until it doubles in value,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.320]   let's say this house is a $300,000 house, if I buy it with $60,000 down and wait for it to go
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:38.640]   up to $600,000, which could take 10 years or so, my $60,000 is going to turn into about $300,000
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.920]   profit. You can calculate how much of a return that is if you'd like. In addition to that,
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.280]   of course, I'll be collecting rent during that period of time. In addition to that,
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.560]   I'll be paying down the loan. Those types of investments, if you compare them to other
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:57.120]   things you can do with your money, generally will outperform anything else you can do.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.280]   That's why I continue to do it.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:03.280]   Interviewer: Probably the missing piece of information for somebody who's a novice is
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.880]   the art of—correct, make sure I'm accurate in this—but the art of real estate investing,
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:15.760]   probably the primary skill is being able to find and negotiate and set up the deal. You can't do
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.160]   that on a retail house where you have a young family that's moving from one town to another
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:26.320]   and they need all the cash up front out of their money to fund the down payment on their—out of
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.160]   their equity to fund the down payment on their next house. But if you can find the deal where
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.680]   it can work—and maybe you can make a deal like that work if you can get it at a wholesale price
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:39.360]   and use an alternate form of financing other than seller financing—but the key is to find those
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:44.400]   deals. That's what, one out of ten? It's not nine out of ten, it's one out of ten that you can find
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.280]   to make it work without needing a bank loan. Is that accurate?
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:52.000]   David Morgan: Well, I'll tell you this. When I teach a class, I only teach it once a year. I
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.240]   teach it here in Sarasota, Florida, and I'll teach it this year on January the 31st and February the
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:02.720]   1st. The students in that class actually go out. We have an exercise one night, and we go through
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:08.240]   neighborhoods in this town. I identify about a half a dozen neighborhoods or so. And they walk
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.880]   down these streets and they talk to people they meet, and they knock on doors, and they find empty
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:19.680]   houses, and they investigate the empty houses. And we look for situations where we can find a
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:26.080]   seller who will carry owner financing. That's our goal. And on a house that's in good shape,
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.720]   in a decent neighborhood, on a good street, a house that we can rent, so it's got to meet all
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:38.160]   that criteria too. And we've always found one. And we do that in two hours. So the lesson here is
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:44.640]   that there are always those properties available. And you have to do some work to find them. People
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.320]   aren't going to call you and say, "I want to sell you my house." I mean, I have had that happen
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.240]   because I've been doing this for a long time, and people know I buy houses. But probably if
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.560]   you're just starting, you're not going to get many phone calls like that. But you can go out and find
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:01.120]   a house that's been sitting empty for a while. And it's just, this is a common sense business.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.880]   If you think about yourself, if you had a house that was sitting empty for a year,
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.640]   and you've been mowing the grass for a year, or shoveling the snow, or whatever you have to do
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.120]   in your town, and making the payments, and paying the taxes, and paying the insurance,
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.120]   at some point, you're going to wake up and say, "Let's just get rid of this house. We're not
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.800]   going to make any money on this house, but maybe we can make it back someplace else."
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.280]   And once you make that decision as a seller, if I can find you as a buyer,
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:30.720]   I can make a really good deal for me, and you'll be happy too. I have never had anybody that I
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.760]   bought a house from be unhappy. They're all happy. They are happy to get rid of a house,
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.640]   because that house is not doing them any good. I'm happy to buy the house, because I know what
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.400]   I'm going to do with it. I know I'm going to rent it, and hold it until it's free and clear,
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.480]   and continue to enjoy that income the rest of my life. And if my kids get in the business,
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.840]   they can enjoy it the rest of their life. I mean, that income goes on forever, and it goes up a
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:57.840]   little bit every year. So, there are opportunities out there in any market. And I guess there are
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.280]   probably some towns that are so small that it might be harder to find the right one.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:06.160]   But if you live in a town of any size at all, and some of my most successful students come from
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:12.640]   towns of four and six thousand people, so they're making a work there. It works. There's always
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:17.680]   opportunity. And this is not a new idea. I mean, it probably goes back to the ancient Greeks or
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:23.280]   something. But I've talked to people who are my grandfather's age who have been buying property
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:29.200]   like this, you know, 50 years ago, 7,500 years ago. So, you know, this is not a new concept.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.120]   People have been financing property when they sell it for a long time. There's a practical
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.040]   matter during certain times in the economy, that's the only way you can get rid of some properties.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:44.480]   This show, we talk a lot about building wealth, and how to start, and how to build a wealth plan.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:50.880]   You have the story of something I've mentioned briefly, but that when you were getting started
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:57.360]   on your wealth plan, you actually chose to rent your residence while accumulating
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:04.480]   investment houses. Could you explain why you did that, how that helped you, and why that might be a
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:11.360]   useful consideration for a young person getting started? That seems a little odd to many people.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:20.080]   Well, if you think about what happens, most people, when they go to buy that first house,
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:27.760]   will buy probably the most house they can afford. And sometimes they buy a house they can't afford.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:33.120]   They buy a nicer house than they can afford, and they really stretch to buy that house.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:39.040]   And then, of course, after you buy a house, it's not over. You get to buy furniture,
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.240]   and then you get to fix that house, and then pretty soon you'll get to remodel that house.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:50.800]   And what young folks find that go out and buy a house to live in early in their lives,
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:57.600]   is that house consumes all their money for a long, long time. And it can be forever. I mean,
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:02.640]   that may be the only property they ever buy. So you have to ask yourself a question. Is this house
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:08.960]   that we're buying to live in a good investment? And the second question might be, for who?
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:14.320]   It might be a good investment for your children, if they inherited. But the whole time you own
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.960]   that house, if you think about what's going on, you're putting money into it. That house
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.440]   is never giving you any money back. There's never going to be any cash flow coming to you from that
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:29.200]   house, and it can consume a lot of your money. Well, if you own the house, free and clear,
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.480]   it would consume a lot less of your money. And of course, in our society, it's not unusual at all
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:39.840]   that people would refinance the house that they live in and take some extra cash out to go buy a
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.960]   car, go on vacation, or put a home equity loan on the house they live in and use that money to go
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:51.040]   out and buy something else. So they pretty much, you can find people who are 65 years old who are
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:55.840]   still in debt on their house, they refinance it two or three times. So they may never own that
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:00.480]   house free and clear, and that house may be really a burden to them at some point in their life.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:07.760]   My advice is to kind of take a contrary approach to that. And what I did, and what I recommend
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:12.240]   others to do, and a lot of people have followed this advice, is rather than going out and buying
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.880]   a house when you're first getting married and first getting started, consider renting a house.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   You can rent a nice house in a nice subdivision for less than what it costs you to buy it.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:29.200]   And I've always rented nice houses that are on my living, a waterfront community here in Sarasota.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:34.320]   So every place I've rented has always been on the water. And I have found that when I go and
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.840]   buy, rent a house in a very nice part of town, in a nice community, I can rent it for a fraction
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:45.440]   of what it costs me to buy it. So I don't give up lifestyle, I get to live in a nice house,
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:50.160]   but I get to live in a nice house for a lot less money than it would cost me if I bought that house.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:56.320]   Now, because I don't have the burden of a big house payment, and I don't have the burden of
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:01.840]   having to remodel that house, or even buy really nice furniture. If you live in a rental house,
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.240]   you can get by with even secondhand furniture if you like. You don't have to go to the store and
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:11.040]   buy all new stuff. Well, you can live pretty cheaply. If I was a single guy, I would probably
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.800]   have roommates. I would be living really cheaply. I'd be having other people pay most of the rent.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:22.000]   But I've been married for 34 years, so a roommate and I share expenses. But we rented a house,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.400]   and for 10 years before I bought the house, and I paid cash when I bought it, for 10 years before
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:33.920]   I rented, before I bought a house, we rented at really good rates. And I would use my money then
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:38.880]   to focus on buying investment properties. Well, the investment properties I bought and held for
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:45.040]   10 years went up in value enough, the loans paid down enough, that I could take two or three of
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:50.640]   those investment properties after 10 years, sell them, and take the cash and buy the house we
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:55.760]   wanted to live in for cash. So I didn't have to finance it. And by doing that, and because I was
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:01.920]   a cash buyer, I was able to negotiate a good price on a house that we finally bought. And now we've
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:08.560]   lived in that house for more than 30 years. We have remodeled it three times. So I don't even
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.960]   want to think about how much money I've invested in that house since that time, since we bought it.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.920]   But I can tell you this, if I'd bought that house the first day, instead of waiting 10 years,
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:24.640]   and if I'd financed that house with a 30-year loan on it, I probably, it would be paid for now,
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:29.520]   but it would have kept me from buying a lot of investments. If you think about what an
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.200]   investment house does for you, it's instead of buying a house to live in, you go out and buy a
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:38.640]   house as an investment, you rent it, you're paying down the loan, it's going up in value,
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:42.960]   you actually get some tax shelter if you need it. And then if you need some money,
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:48.160]   it's not an emotional thing to sell an investment house and take the cash and go out and use it to
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:53.760]   do something. It is an emotional thing if you have to sell the house you live in. If you're
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.360]   forced to sell that house, or if you go borrow more, you have to have that house do something,
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:07.520]   that's an emotional event. So I want to emphasize that it's just a better strategy not to get into
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:14.720]   a lot of debt and tied into a lot of debt, and especially by buying too much house to start with.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:19.840]   If you're going to buy a house, buy something simple. Back when I was a kid, my parents lived
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:25.520]   in a very small house, my grandparents lived in a smaller house. What we've seen today,
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:29.680]   and I've been involved with a group called First Habitat for Humanity for about 25 years,
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.880]   and now I chair the Fuller Center for Housing, both the non-profit housing providers, and we
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:40.400]   build very simple, decent houses for people who don't have much income but who need a place to
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:46.960]   live. And even those houses are bigger. The Habitat houses have become bigger over the years,
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.520]   and we started the Fuller Center to build smaller and smaller houses. So we focus on building
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:56.960]   houses we can sell to families for about $50,000 with no interest and no profit,
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:02.080]   and that allows a family who doesn't make much money to afford a house. Well, my suggestion,
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.800]   you move into a Fuller Center house or a Habitat house, but you can find some pretty simple houses
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:12.800]   out there to buy for a lot less money. And if you start off with smaller and then work your way up,
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:20.080]   that's a more fun path in life than having to step down. There was a lot of people during this
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:25.040]   last recession that owned a really nice house, and they lost it, and now they're in a much smaller
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:30.480]   house. So start off in a smaller house. Think about a strategy of renting for a while and investing
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:37.520]   in it. It's not something you have to do forever, but when you accumulate some capital and you're
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:42.000]   able to buy a house for cash, you'll get a lot of satisfaction out of owning your own home free and
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:49.600]   clear. Economic cycles change over time, and you wrote an entire book on this called Building Real
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:58.640]   Estate Wealth and a Changing Market, and it was published in 2007. What impact do economic
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:05.760]   conditions, recessions, growth periods, inflation of real estate prices, decreasing of real estate
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:12.320]   prices, what impact do those conditions have on a real estate investor, and how does a wise real
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:18.400]   estate investor negotiate and navigate successfully through whatever the economic cycle we're in?
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:24.240]   Well, we could go on for a few hours here. Well, you did write a whole book on it, so
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:31.600]   I assume you've got a few things to say on it. First of all, accept a couple things. Number one,
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:38.080]   there will be cycles. There'll be cycles in the business world, in the credit market, in taxes,
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:43.200]   in your personal life. You have good days and bad days. You have good years and bad years,
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:48.240]   and there's opportunities during all those different times, different opportunities.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:55.840]   Number two, you can anticipate. It's very hard to predict what's going to happen.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.520]   I had a guy call me the other day and said he's predicted the last five recessions to the day.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.800]   I said, "When did you predict them?" "Well, I think you predicted them last week." You know,
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.720]   it's easy to predict them five years ago. It's hard to predict them in the next five years.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:13.520]   Nobody that I knew anticipated the last downturn. Now, there's people now that claim they did,
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:22.400]   but they didn't do it in advance. So, you can't foretell the future. So, what you have to do
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:28.880]   is you have to have a strategy that protects you and the continent that you profit from
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:37.520]   if we're going to have the Great Depression or big runaway inflation, big runaway economy. You
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:41.680]   have to play both sides of it. So, you have to have some assets that are safe in case we have
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:46.240]   the big downturn. Then, on the other hand, you want to have some assets that are in a position
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:52.400]   to make you a big profit if we have a great market. So, it's an interesting discussion.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:44:00.160]   I've gone through four major recessions in this town in the last 40 years, and the first one was
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:04.560]   a real learning experience. I've been fortunate. I've never gone broke because I've never had a
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:09.200]   bank loan. I've always had owner financing. So, when we have these recessions, I can go back to
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:14.160]   the people I bought the houses from and say, "You can either have the houses back, or we can talk
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:20.400]   about what will work during this economy." An interesting thing we've learned is this last
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:26.080]   downturn, even though prices dropped by about 50 percent in our town, the rents didn't drop that
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:31.840]   much. They came down 10 or 15 percent. People needed, you know, they still wanted to live inside,
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:37.840]   and then folks who lost their houses, of course, became tenants. It created an interesting
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:42.400]   situation where we had a shortage of houses that were available for rent because a lot of the
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:47.440]   houses in foreclosure were not available for rent. A lot of the houses that were being rehabbed were
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.680]   only half fixed up, so they weren't available for rent. So, we ended up with a shortage of
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:55.280]   rental houses, and we ended up with a lot of folks who wanted to be tenants because they
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.440]   were moving out of the houses they lost. So, the rents didn't come down as much,
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:06.000]   but every cycle is different. And the next major cycle we have is bound to be different than the
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.680]   one we just went through. This last one was caused by a credit crisis. The next one will
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.760]   probably be caused by something else. The '86 one was caused by a big tax law change. So,
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:19.200]   you just can't, you know, anticipate exactly what's going to happen next. But you can have
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:25.200]   a safe portfolio. You can have a portfolio that if prices do drop 20 or 30 percent, you survive.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:31.120]   If they go up 20 or 30 percent, you're in a position to take a nice profit. And some of
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:35.360]   this just comes through experience. And as I say, you know, I teach people. I tell stories about
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.240]   what I've done and what has worked for me and the mistakes we've made. But you're really going to
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:46.000]   learn this by doing it. So, you know, if you'll learn to be safe, as safe as you can be, then
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.760]   hopefully you'll never go broke. And when you have a downturn, you'll be in a position to
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:57.280]   survive. And then when everybody else is getting out of the business, if you've got your head on
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:02.320]   straight and you have the ability to buy, you make some of the best deals of your life, of course,
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:07.440]   when everybody else is selling and everybody says real estate will never come back. It's a terrible
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:14.640]   idea to buy real estate. That's the time to buy. A lot is made when you go to a real estate
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:19.040]   investment seminar about the tax efficiency of real estate. And for many people who've never
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:25.920]   owned investment property, it's kind of a new concept. Could you explain just briefly some
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:32.240]   of the general principles that do make independent real estate investment useful and efficient for
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:41.200]   a tax perspective as to why it is so advantageous in many ways? Well, probably two simple things.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:49.600]   One, when you buy a property at a below market price, of course, that profit that you're making
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:55.120]   is tax free to you today. I like to tell the story about Donald Trump who came down to West Palm. He
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:59.520]   bought a six million dollar house for three million dollars. Well, you buy a six million
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:04.720]   dollar house for three million dollars and those are real numbers. You actually made three million
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:09.200]   dollars, but that three million dollars isn't taxable to you. And what Donald did shortly
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.640]   thereafter, I think, is I think he borrowed against it. So he may have put a million dollars
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.920]   in his pocket. He may have borrowed four million dollars against the house he paid three million
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:21.920]   dollars for. And of course, that borrowed money is not taxable to you. So in his situation, he
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.040]   bought a six million dollar house for three million dollars, borrowed four million against
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:31.840]   it. I'm just making these numbers up, but that's probably somewhat true. And all in, he hasn't paid
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.320]   a dime of taxes yet and he still owns his house with two million dollars in equity in it. Well,
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:42.400]   you're not going to buy a six million dollar house, but the same tax laws apply to you when
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:47.680]   you buy a hundred thousand dollar house for ninety thousand or eighty thousand. You're making that
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:54.320]   profit and you're making it without paying taxes. I have a student who's a medical doctor and makes
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:48:00.480]   good money practicing medicine, but he pays a lot of taxes because the income that he makes
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:05.520]   practicing medicine is all personal income, it's taxed at the highest rate. So he decided years
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:10.560]   ago to start taking a couple of months a year off. And when he took a couple of months a year off,
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:14.400]   his goal during that couple of months a year was to go out and buy two or three houses.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:19.600]   And he would do that. And he'd go out and buy a house and he'd buy it below market,
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.920]   because he knew if he could go out and buy a house that was worth one hundred and fifty thousand for
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:28.960]   one hundred and twenty five, that's twenty five thousand dollars in profit that he can push off
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:34.640]   and not pay taxes on today. And it would grow over time. And of course, that growth is also tax free.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.720]   So if he buys a hundred fifty thousand dollar house for one twenty five and he holds it until
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.800]   it doubles in value, and now it's worth three hundred thousand dollars, all that profit is
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:49.280]   accumulated is still tax free to him. And the rents that come in, they're going to be taxable.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.360]   But if he wanted to borrow against that house or if he wanted to sell that house,
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:58.640]   he could pay taxes at a lower rate on his profits than he would on money he earned
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:06.720]   practicing medicine. The highest tax rates are charged to people who work and are subject to
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:13.120]   payroll taxes, Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes and ordinary income taxes. Those folks
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:19.120]   often live in a state, this fellow from California, who lives in a state that has a state income tax,
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:23.280]   he would spend about 50 percent of his income in taxes, round figures.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:28.400]   Well, if he can stop and if he has enough money to live on and he can stop,
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:35.360]   you know, live, stop earning income and then use some of his time to buy property,
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:40.560]   buy investment property to provide him tax free income and long term capital gain profits down
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:47.360]   the road, he can accumulate a large net worth and at the same time live a more tax efficient life.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:53.360]   Now, if you think about it, if I buy a house, the house I bought in 1973, which I still own,
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:58.800]   and it's doubled in value several times, I don't have to pay taxes on that profit until I sell it.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:04.480]   And I don't ever have to sell it. There's a good chance that I'll leave that house to my children
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:10.240]   in their estate. And when they inherit that property, there's a part of the law that talks
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:16.480]   about what happens to the taxable basis when you inherit property. But the current law is that
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:23.280]   the people that inherit the property get a stepped up basis. And what that means is if I bought that
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:27.040]   property for thirty thousand, it's worth more than three hundred today. Let's say when they
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:33.680]   inherited it, it's worth four hundred thousand dollars. They would receive a basis, a new basis
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:38.640]   of the fair market value of my debt, which might be four hundred thousand dollars. They could then
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.600]   sell that house for four hundred thousand dollars the next day and pay no taxes on it. So that whole
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:47.360]   transaction, that thirty thousand dollar original investment that grew to four hundred thousand
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:52.960]   dollars, they inherited and now they sold. That whole transaction is tax free. There's no income
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:59.280]   tax paid on it. So there are some strategies that benefit rich people, just to say it out loud,
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:07.520]   and that rich people understand, and it has to do with asset accrual and asset appreciation
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:13.760]   that benefit folks who do this. And wealthy people have been using these for years, of course.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:20.000]   Do you have many people in today's world of uncertainty, especially with some of the
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.360]   fluctuations in the publicly traded stock market, look to real estate and their money's in their
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:31.920]   IRAs? So I've seen a real growth in the interest of using self-directed IRAs, self-directed ESAs,
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:36.560]   HSAs, and investing in real estate through those accounts. Do you have any perspective,
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:41.840]   opinions, observations, or experience on people doing that and the advantages and disadvantages
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:47.920]   of that type of approach with real estate? Well, when you say IRA, you may be talking about more
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:55.680]   than one type of vehicle here. You could have a traditional IRA that distributes its profits,
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:01.680]   its taxable income to the beneficiaries because when they make contributions to that IRA,
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:08.880]   they deducted the contributions. That's certainly a different type of investment vehicle than the
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:16.320]   Roth IRA, which started about 14 years ago. And a Roth IRA allows people to make contributions to a
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:20.960]   retirement plan that are non-deductible. You don't get a deduction today. But then when the
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:27.680]   withdrawals are made and profits are taken out, they are tax-free. So first of all,
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:33.040]   you have to separate these two ideas because there's different strategies for these two
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:40.960]   different types of investment plans. If you have a Roth IRA that allows you to take profits out
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:45.920]   tax-free, you can always take your contributions out tax-free, but you can take your profits out
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:52.080]   tax-free too. Then investing in something that's going to have a lot of appreciation over time
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:53:00.160]   makes a lot of sense. If you have a traditional IRA or a qualified pension plan, investing in an
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:06.560]   asset that's going to produce capital gains does not make any sense because if you have a large
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:13.520]   capital gain personally and you pay the tax on that, your rate's going to be relatively low,
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:19.360]   it's taxed capital gains rates. If you have a large capital gain inside a retirement plan,
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:25.360]   a qualified plan or a regular IRA, when that profit comes out, it's going to be taxed to you
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:30.880]   at ordinary income rates. So you might be paying twice as much in taxes. So hopefully everybody's
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:38.240]   clear on that. The Roth IRA is an excellent tool to use for real estate investors who understand
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:43.920]   how to use it. Unfortunately, and we're seeing a lot of this now, but there's a lot of
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:52.160]   people investing in business properties in the Roth IRA, which is not allowed. There are people
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:57.040]   that are self-dealing, they try to sell things to themselves, or they try to borrow money from
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:02.000]   the Roth IRA. They make prohibited transactions and they don't understand they're doing this.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.680]   They're getting bad advice sometimes. And if you do this, then when you get caught, if you get
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:12.080]   caught, the penalties are stiff. You're going to have to pay taxes on all the money, probably,
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:19.680]   plus penalties. So investing in real estate in an IRA is possible. And I would encourage it,
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:26.320]   but I'd encourage it only with really good information. If you don't know how to do it,
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:32.000]   you need to get some good advice and not from one of your high-priced seminars,
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.320]   you know, not from a $30,000 seminar. Those guys will just make up some good stories for you.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:41.600]   But, you know, from a real CPA, from a real tax attorney, from somebody who's in the business,
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:46.160]   and there's some good folks in the business who will give you the straight scoop. It's the law.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:52.880]   You can read the law, but too many people try to get around the law somehow, and that's not a good
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:57.520]   strategy. So the important thing to understand, though, at the beginning is there's two types of
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:03.680]   plans. You don't want to invest in a traditional plan in assets that produce long-term capital
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:09.280]   gains because you're paying twice as much in taxes. - I think he's a friend of yours. Is it
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:13.040]   Peter Fortunato? Is his seminar a good resource for people? I think he does a whole seminar on
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:17.680]   that. Am I right? - There are a number of people who do. Yeah, Pete Fortunato and Dykes Botterford
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:23.360]   teach a class in Atlanta once a year on IRA investing, and I would recommend that. They're
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:28.800]   both very bright people. - Yeah, I've got that one on my list of classes to take because I'm
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:32.800]   familiar with the tax law side of it, but not from the specific real estate perspective. So
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:38.640]   it's on my list of classes to take. Do you have any sense, one of the things that I encourage
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:44.000]   people to look at when they're building out their wealth plan is to try to figure out where their
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.040]   highest rate of return is going to come from as far as where their investment highest rate of return
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:55.200]   potential is, and that's going to be different for each person. But I'm just curious, with your
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:02.000]   decades of experience, do you have any either sense, gut sense, or do you have any metrics that
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.640]   you've actually tracked to have an idea of how much, what your average rate of return has been
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:14.720]   over the years with your good deals and bad deals just over the course of your career? - Sure. It's
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:19.440]   our business. That's what we do. We pay a lot of attention to which investments make us the most
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:28.080]   money and on an after-tax basis because that's the only part that really counts. And a lot of
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:34.320]   the things I've talked about today come into play there. This untaxed part of the capital gain that
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:42.080]   you're able to defer until you sell or leave it to your kids is a big part of that. Long before I was
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:48.640]   in the real estate business, I was involved in charting stocks and playing commodity options,
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:55.920]   did some other things where I was trying to make some money in a hurry. And I learned by studying
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:00.800]   the securities business a little bit and commodity options, stock options, different things that
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:05.440]   there's a lot of different ways to make money. There's thousands of different ways to make
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:11.440]   money. You can start a restaurant and make money. But what it comes down to for me is safety,
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:16.400]   being able to sleep well at night, lifestyle, being able to get away from something. I have
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:22.080]   good friends who play the stock market every day and they won't take a day off because they're
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:26.960]   afraid something bad will happen to them. And in the real estate business, you can take a day off.
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:31.280]   I take months off sometimes. My view of retirement is a little different than some people. I wrote
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:35.840]   a course on retirement investing a couple years ago, a year and a half or so ago. And I like to
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:40.480]   be able to retire on a day-by-day basis. If I want to take a day off, I want to be able to take a day
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:45.440]   off and not have anything bad happen to my investments. And so I've set my life up that way.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:53.120]   I invest in things that work with or without me. If I get run over by a bus or crash my airplane
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:59.680]   someplace, I want my investments to continue to produce income for my spouse and my heirs.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:06.960]   I don't want to just disappear on me. So it's not just investments. I have a lot of personal
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:11.200]   input. Now I've had some, of course, to buy the right properties and to manage them well. But
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:16.480]   without me, it still works. So that's the important part. As far as the amount of money we made,
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:21.520]   our overall rates of return over time, if you want to use just a round number, it's about 20%
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:27.760]   compounded over the last 40 years. So numbers do go up. And if you do that math, you're not
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:33.680]   going to figure out my net worth because I spend a lot of money. We enjoy traveling. We live in a
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:40.560]   nice house. We have kids scattered all over the world. So we love taking our kids on good vacations,
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:48.640]   scuba diving and skiing and doing things all over the world. But 20% is not a return you get on an
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:53.760]   annualized basis over 40 years unless you're pretty darn conservative. It's not a speculative
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:59.520]   thing. And people who speculate try to play markets, try to tie markets, rarely get those
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:04.240]   kind of returns. I've served on several foundation boards that have a lot of money that are
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:09.680]   professionally managed, and they're pretty happy if they can make 5% or 6% or 7% over a 20- or
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:18.960]   30-year basis. So to make those kind of yields, you have to have information and exercise it.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:23.600]   Other folks don't have. You have to know how to do something that most people can't do.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:30.080]   But it is learnable. This is not rocket science. I'm certainly not a rocket scientist. I'm one of
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:36.480]   these guys who's steady, who has a plan, who stays the course. And I continue to teach so
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:41.520]   other people can learn how to do that. Three final questions as we finish our
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:48.240]   interview here. The first one, how would somebody, if they're doing some self-evaluation
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:52.560]   and they're looking at what their skills are, what their abilities are, and they're trying to
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:58.560]   figure out if real estate is the right forum for them to dig into for their wealth plan,
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:06.400]   what does it take to be a good investor? And how would you know if you have that, whatever it is,
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.720]   versus knowing whether you're better off, better served pursuing wealth in another
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:18.240]   career or another area? Well, I think number one is probably delayed gratification.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:25.840]   If you can invest in something, knowing that if you hold onto it for 5 or 10 or 15 years,
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:32.080]   it'll make you a lot of money or probably make you a lot of money. But it's not going to be a
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:37.680]   short-term profit. It's going to be a longer-term profit. I think that fits well for real estate
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:43.280]   investment and it's worked well for Warren Buffett. The people that buy with the idea of not
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:49.040]   selling an investment, that hold in it for a long time, are true investors. People that buy with
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.480]   the idea that they're going to sell it in a year or two and make a quick profit are speculators.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.200]   And so to be an investor, you have to have this long-term outlook, I think.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.680]   The second thing is understanding money. If you're not good at math, if you didn't do well
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.840]   in the fourth grade, that's about as far as you need to go. But you need to be able to add,
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:13.120]   subtract. Percentages are not a bad thing. Understanding the rule of 72 is a good thing.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.280]   Knowing how long it's going to take to double your money at different rates,
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.680]   understanding compound interest, and being comfortable with the math side of it so you
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:27.360]   have some confidence in your ability to grow money. And then the third thing is people skills.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.560]   We talked about earlier, if you are not willing to talk to people, manage people,
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.600]   probably you're better off hiring somebody else to do that. That doesn't mean you can't invest in
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:44.960]   real estate, but the management is a key piece of this. You've mentioned a few different names.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.680]   Somebody for whom this is their first introduction to real estate and they're interested and they
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:54.880]   say, "I fit those criteria. I'm interested in pursuing it." What would be some suggested
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:00.400]   recommended resources, a reading list, courses, and make sure to mention your own course that you
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:06.720]   do as well. Well, it's a little self-serving, but I have been teaching people for a long time and
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:12.960]   have had some success. So I would suggest you get on my website, which is just Google John
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:19.840]   Schaub. That's C-H-A-U-B. It'll pop up. We've over the years written a lot. I've written a number of
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:25.280]   books. I've been writing newsletters since the 70s. I've recorded probably 15 different courses.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:31.360]   Some of them are not available anymore, but about 10 recent courses that are one-day courses on
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:37.280]   specific topics and they're very helpful to folks. Other than that, I haven't read a contemporary
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.560]   book in a while that I thought was right on point, but the books I mentioned earlier,
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.080]   you've got no reason to repeat them, but the books I mentioned earlier were all good books.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.680]   I continue to read and I continue to listen to other people speak and look for people who are
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.280]   ahead of me in the business so I can learn from them. Of course, if you're just starting,
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:02.960]   you need to be looking for folks who can get you started. I have a whole list of folks on my
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:07.920]   website, different links you can go to. So I would start there. I would go to the website and read
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:13.600]   what I've published and while I work for free and then look at the links and study those people.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.200]   I know, final question. I know Habitat for Humanity is a cause that's near and dear to
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.200]   your heart and you've been involved over decades, as you mentioned earlier. Take just a moment and
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:29.360]   mention Habitat, the work that you do and what you've learned in helping and then how people
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.240]   can get involved with Habitat and what would be helpful and why they should consider it.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:40.400]   Well, I was involved with Habitat for more than 20 years. I chair a board now called the Fuller
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:45.120]   Center for Housing, F-U-L-L-E-R, Fuller Center for Housing. And both of them do good work.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:49.920]   The Fuller Center was started a couple years back to help people that are even
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:55.120]   poorer than the folks that Habitat's able to help. We take existing houses, we renovate them,
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:00.160]   and then we sell them at no interest and no profit. So that's the focus of my efforts right
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.480]   now is with the Fuller Center. But both Habitat and Fuller Center do well. They're both widely
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:09.360]   known. So if you can Google either one and if they're active in your area, volunteer,
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.360]   it's a great way to learn how to build a house. All my kids build houses and picked up those
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:18.000]   skills. And it's a great way to help build community in your town where you bring people
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.640]   together to work on a project and improve your town, improve somebody's life, improve your life.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.720]   So it's all good work. It's all good news. Awesome. John, thank you so much for making
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.280]   the time to come on. This has been a wealth of information and I thank you for being willing
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:40.080]   to do it. Okay. My pleasure and best of luck with all you're doing. Did you learn something?
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:48.960]   Remember, you too can do this. This is not out of reach. Many people have done it. You too
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.840]   can do it. If you're interested, if this is something that appeals to you, start doing your
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:59.120]   homework. And we're coming up on a new year here. It's December 2014 as we come up on a new year
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:04.960]   here. Be thinking about what is your plan for the investment side of the equation? What's your plan
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:13.280]   for how to grow your wealth? Real estate can be a powerful way to do that. And so I encourage you to
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:22.400]   begin the journey. John's books would be a great place. I have four of them. I have his book
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:26.720]   Building Wealth One House at a Time, Building Wealth Buying Foreclosures, and Building Real
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:32.960]   Estate Wealth in a Changing Market. I also have a book called Buying Right. So I would just
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:37.200]   recommend start with Building Wealth One House at a Time. That's the best overview. Consider his
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.840]   seminar. I've heard great things about it. It's at the end of January in Sarasota, Florida. And so
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:45.760]   that would also be a great place to start. It might be a good place for you to go to
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:51.280]   enhance your education and your knowledge for this new year.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:56.640]   That's it for today's show. I thank you all for being with me. A couple quick announcements as
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:02.880]   we go out the door here. Number one, the schedule for the rest of this week, tomorrow I have an
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:10.480]   interview for you with Scott Young. Scott is the man who did the MIT Challenge. And he was the one
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.440]   who essentially recreated his own MIT degree without ever going to the school, without paying
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:19.280]   for it. On Wednesday, I'm going to bring you another technical show. We're going to do some
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.360]   technical end of the year planning topics. And that'll be the last of the technical shows for
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.840]   the year. I'm getting ready to take off for the next two weeks, working on a lot of business
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.920]   stuff behind the scenes and really trying to make some progress on that. So I'm just going to be
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:35.120]   releasing some interviews next two weeks. But I will be releasing shows so that way you don't
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:39.760]   have to go without a show. Thursday, however, I'm bringing Jim Rawls, author of Survival Blog,
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:45.920]   back on the show. He was very...many of you really enjoyed the first interview that I did with him.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:50.240]   And it's an interesting topic. So we're going to talk a little bit about moving as a way to
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:55.680]   improve your lifestyle and save money, both moving across the country and expatriation and different
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:00.080]   ideas for that. Friday, I'm going to be doing another Friday Q&A show. And the next week,
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:08.720]   I have an interview on Monday for you with Ben Falk from Whole Systems Design up in Vermont.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:16.480]   Tuesday, I will be releasing an interview with Dr. Vern Poitras, who is a professor at a
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:21.040]   theological seminary, former mathematics, also a mathematics PhD. We're going to talk about
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:29.200]   children briefly. Friday is an interview with Jeff from the Sustainable Life blog. We're going to
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:34.240]   talk about investing in your house. Then the following Monday will be Eva from Teens Got
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:42.640]   Sense, a fascinating young lady who writes a blog on finance for kids. And then I got a couple more
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:47.040]   as well that'll be coming up that week also. So if you'd like to get in touch with me, Joshua@radical
