[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   Well, digital pornography is ubiquitous.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.800]   So how do we prepare our sons and daughters to win the war against the porn culture all
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.800]   around them?
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.160]   It's a great question from a mom named Molly.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.540]   Pastor John, thanks for this podcast and all the times you address parenting.
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.520]   My question for you is this, what is the best way to prepare our children to go out on their
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.400]   own in our pornified culture?
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.280]   I have two young boys and seeing so many good, godly men fall victim to various kinds of
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.640]   lust makes me deeply sad to think about my own boys becoming more aware.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.720]   I know at the end of the day the Lord is sovereign, but is there anything specifically I and my
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.520]   husband can do now to help them to see what is truly valuable and to prepare them for
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.080]   these digital temptations ahead?
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.200]   Well, I doubt that I have any greater wisdom here than Molly and her husband do, but I'll
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.040]   give a list of things that they can at least compare their list to and see if there might
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.080]   be one or two things that they haven't thought of that might be helpful.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.520]   And of course, I want to make clear that when you make a list like this, each one of these
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.520]   is a reality.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.920]   It's a massive reality.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.680]   It's not just, oh, here's another thing on the list to tick off.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.640]   So I hope we're all aware that even though I'll go through these pretty quickly, every
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.080]   one of them is a work of the spirit that needs our whole heart.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.580]   There's no guarantee that our children will turn out to be believers or walk in the ways
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.640]   that we want them to.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.160]   But I do phrase the question like this.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:52.040]   Why do some children trust dad and mom and their way and want to conform their lives
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.320]   to the vision of their parents and then make it their own someday?
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.720]   And other children, almost from the beginning, seem to treat their parents as if they're
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.560]   foolish or unwise or unworthy of trust, always pushing against and pushing against instead
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.560]   of saying, well, of course, mom and dad know best.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.560]   They're older than I am.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.480]   And they've been around the block a few times.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.320]   And why is that?
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.400]   Why do some children, even in the same family, do that?
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.360]   So what we want is strategies that God might be pleased to use to create in our children
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:35.840]   a deep personal trust in us as parents at first, and then through us, finally, a trust
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.480]   in the true and living God as our children experience their faith as completely their
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.480]   own.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.840]   So let's keep that in mind.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.240]   This is there's no guarantee here.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.520]   Children in the same family treated the same way can be resistant or compliant.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.040]   And our goal is not external conformity to rules.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.400]   It's inward love for God and his way.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.720]   So here's my list.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.400]   One, children need a humble heart in order to comply with mom and dad and with the scripture.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.160]   So pray earnestly that they would be humble under the mighty hand of God.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.360]   God would give them the gift of deep humility.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.200]   Number two, seek to be utterly authentic in your own love for Christ and your own joy
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.040]   in him and your own delight in his ways.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.200]   You can't force upon a child satisfaction in a God that does not look as if he's satisfying
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.560]   mom and dad.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.980]   Three, saturate your family with scripture, morning, noon and night.
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.120]   Talk of it when you get up, when you go to the meals, when you're riding in the car,
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.880]   talk of the word of God and seek to help your children treat the Bible as the absolute authority
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.680]   in your life.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.440]   Pray that the children will grow up believing that this book is the highest authority in
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.120]   the universe under God.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:19.840]   Number four, highlight in the Bible the superior joy that comes from knowing Christ rather
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.820]   than all the forms of sin they might pursue.
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.880]   Make this a recurrent theme in all your teaching.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:35.320]   Even Paul in saying that you count everything as lost because of the surpassing value of
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.420]   knowing Christ Jesus.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.560]   Help them flesh that out and see that's why we're going to obey.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:50.480]   There's a better, more joyful, more lasting, more satisfying way with God than with sin.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:57.200]   Five, tell stories again and again from the Bible, from society, from history, from missions
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.120]   about young people, young men, young women who did amazingly sacrificial things for the
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.640]   joy that was set before them in God.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.000]   In the end, most of our children grow up craving significance as much as they crave other things
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.360]   and they need to know where do you find real significance, doing something that really
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.360]   counts with your life.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.400]   And those stories, Daniel, David, Timothy, and then missionary stories and military stories
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.600]   from World War I and II and the Civil War, just different things like that where our
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.480]   children will hear stories of young people who did amazing acts of bravery.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.400]   Number six, make the gospel the constant refrain of all of our teaching.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:54.640]   I mean, keep in front of the children that Christ died for sinners and that he provides
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:02.640]   a way of preserving and restoring fellowship with himself when we have failed.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.760]   All children fail.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.660]   They all do bad things.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.380]   Their conscience bothers them.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.080]   They know they are sinners.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:19.320]   They need to be reminded again and again about the gospel way of handling failure and sin,
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.000]   not the world's way.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.520]   Otherwise they're going to become secretive and hide their sins because they don't know
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.560]   how to settle them with God, let alone with their parents.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.480]   But if the parents are constantly holding out the gospel way of dealing with failure,
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:44.760]   then they might keep their children from going underground with regard to their sins.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.640]   Number seven, don't assume that all is well in their hearts.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.320]   Probe.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.080]   Ask more than the brief, "How are you doing?"
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.080]   question.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.600]   Get alone with them in the seclusion of a bedroom or in the car or a restaurant where
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.920]   just you and that one child go.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.320]   Dig into their hearts, their feelings, their fears, their hope, the challenges they feel
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.320]   at school and with their other siblings.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.000]   And don't settle for a glib, superficial one-word answer.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.680]   Tell them stories about your own feelings as a child, your own failures and sins and
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.080]   struggles so that they'll be open that way.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.480]   Few things, I think, soften a child and give them hope than to know mom and dad are not
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.480]   infallible.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:43.120]   Number eight, help your children find good Christian, godly friends.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.000]   The Bible says that bad company corrupts good morals in 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.600]   Of course, we want our children to grow up and be good evangelists someday among unbelievers,
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:01.480]   but it's a mistake to think that finding their closest friends among unbelievers is a good
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.080]   preparation for young minds.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.240]   There's a difference between loving unbelievers and loving what they love.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:16.680]   And for young, impressionable minds, the methods of spiritual warfare against the powers of
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.400]   darkness are not yet in full force.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.280]   Number nine, be sure, if you can, that your children have a good church where they're
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.920]   forming the habits of corporate worship and discipleship.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:40.100]   Let them see you, mom and dad, love your church and worship and sing and pray and become active
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.640]   church men and women.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.860]   That's what you want them to be.
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.720]   They need to see that.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:52.600]   Number 10, establish in your home protections on all your electronic devices so that the
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:59.040]   child is subject to the same scrutiny as mom and dad are, or vice versa, mom and dad are
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.520]   to the child.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:06.520]   Don't treat them as untrustworthy while you pretend to be above scrutiny.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:13.200]   Let them know that the whole family regards the dangers of pornography and its easy accessibility,
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.520]   as well as other superficial distractions.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:23.200]   Let them know that mom and dad share in the same concern, the same burden, the same susceptibility
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.300]   and the same accountability.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:32.720]   And finally, number 11, I would suggest that mom and dad form a relationship with one or
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:40.720]   two other couples to form a plan to fast and pray together, say once a week or so, where
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:47.400]   you skip a lunch, show up, pray for 30 minutes just for your children, each other's children,
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:53.600]   that God would exert supernatural power to work in your children all the dreams you have
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   for their godliness.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.520]   And I'm sure there are other important things that I haven't said, but I'll mention these,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:09.080]   these 11 in the hope that they might stimulate our friends to, Molly, to go deeper and seek
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.320]   her own way with her kids.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.240]   That's gold Pastor John, thank you.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:19.960]   And this episode reminds me of episode 948, how do we prepare our kids for suffering?
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:25.640]   It's a different topic, but a similar model here of counsel to parents on parenting.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.720]   Episode 948, how do we prepare our kids for suffering?
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.720]   Over at our online home, you can explore all 1250 of those past episodes.

[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.720]   Well, should we raise our hands during musical worship or should we keep them safely in our
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.720]   pockets?
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.400]   It's a great question with a surprising twist of an answer really, and that's when we return
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   on Monday.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.600]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, sorry to leave you in suspense, but have a great weekend
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.400]   and we'll see you then.
