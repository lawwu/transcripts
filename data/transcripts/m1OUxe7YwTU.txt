[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   I think what would be much more valuable than all of this is for companies to hire from a whole
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.920]   bunch of different schools than they do today and to break the back of this elitist culture
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.800]   we have around certain schools. There's not necessarily an advantage for studying physics
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.560]   at any of these two schools. It's not like one's teaching you that gravity goes up and the other
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.720]   teaches you that gravity goes down. We have fallen into this trap of saying that these
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.760]   highly credentialed schools that cost 60 and 70 and 80 thousand dollars a year graduate the best
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.080]   kids. And I don't think that that's true either. Today I just gave an offer to a guy that went to
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.600]   Virginia Tech and this kid seems awesome. To be honest, I think schools like that are better. I
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.760]   mean I think probably Virginia Tech is better than Harvard. They're way better. And the reason is
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.360]   because they're less infected with the whole woke DEI ideology that now pervades these like top
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.360]   schools. So the students are more likely to learn something. They're not the smartest kids. They're
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.120]   not the hardest working kids. So we should stop saying top schools. These Ivy League schools are
