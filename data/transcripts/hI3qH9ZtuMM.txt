[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   (music)
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.500]   This is maybe a little bit more of an abstract question than we normally get,
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.000]   and it comes from two different listeners.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.900]   Mark writes in to ask this,
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.300]   "Pastor John, I'm an analytical thinker and have in the past devoured your books.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.900]   Call me a piper groupie.
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.300]   I find myself intellectually satisfied and yet spiritually lacking in my heart.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.100]   I believe and understand and am thrilled by what I read, but it just isn't mine.
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.800]   I haven't experienced it as my own.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.500]   I figure I need to seek Jesus myself in prayer and meditate on the Word
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.800]   and not just read about it.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.000]   You are certainly analytical, but you have made biblical truths your own.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.700]   Can you comment on how to move beyond unapplied analysis?"
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.800]   And related to this, Chris emails in to ask this,
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.200]   "Many times I feel I know a lot about God instead of knowing God.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.000]   Pastor John, am I missing an intimacy other Christians have?"
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.400]   Well, let me take those together because I think, Tony, that
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.200]   at least they sound to me like they're very—they're coming from the same place.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.500]   And my answer is, to use the words of Chris's question,
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:11.300]   yes, you are missing an intimacy that some, and I'm saying some, other Christians have.
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.100]   They don't always have it.
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.800]   They have it now, maybe, but they may not have it tomorrow.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.900]   You have something that they, some of them, don't have in your grasp of Scripture.
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.900]   And the point of saying both of those, that yes, they have something
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.900]   you don't have, and yes, you have something they don't have,
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:43.100]   is to protect us from thinking in a kind of simplistic way about the affections of the human heart.
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:51.900]   There are so many different kinds of Christian hearts and different kinds of experiences,
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.000]   emotional heart experiences of the living Christ.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.600]   So we must beware of thinking in simple either/or categories.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.100]   The kind of experience that we're talking about,
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.600]   that I think these brothers so long to experience, is a heartfelt brokenness,
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.400]   a heartfelt fear of God, joy or thankfulness or tenderheartedness,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.000]   remorse for sin, compassion for the lost, admiration for Christ, hope in His promises.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.800]   Those are the kinds of things we're talking about when we say our heart,
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.000]   heartfelt affections or emotions.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And the fact is, they're never constant.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.300]   Not even from one hour to the next in the soul of a saint are they constant.
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.300]   They rise, they fall, they burn, they cool, they hover in the middle, and they dip and rise.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.400]   They're a moving target.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:02.900]   So every one of us, with our unique capacities for emotion in Christ,
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.300]   have to be very careful never to say as a Christian, "I don't have those."
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.700]   And we should never say, "I've got all I need."
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.300]   No Christian has what we need, and no Christian has none.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.900]   You're not a Christian if you don't have any awakenings of affection for Jesus.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.900]   There are always greater ones to be had at any moment.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.200]   We live in a fallen world with fallen bodies and fallen minds and fallen hearts,
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.700]   and we groan, Paul says, longing for the final deliverance.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.700]   And what strikes me as especially encouraging in these questions—
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.700]   and I would just address these brothers Mark and Chris directly—
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:02.900]   what encourages me about you is that you are really bothered by the level of affections that you have for God.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.900]   You wish you had more.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.300]   You feel like second-handers.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.300]   You read a book and see what others feel, and that gives some measure of satisfaction,
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.300]   but you feel—but they're not mine, at least not in the intensity that I seem to be reading about them in others.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.900]   And I simply want to say that's very encouraging to me,
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:32.500]   because I know Christians who are cool in their affections, and it doesn't bother them at all.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.900]   They're not writing anybody for advice.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.300]   They're not desperately seeking help with this.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.900]   And so the very longing to have what you don't feel you have is a having,
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.700]   which is more precious than you may realize.
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.400]   So my concern here is simply to help you fight for joy,
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.200]   rather than to give you a momentary high that you might have right now,
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.800]   and then not have tomorrow and wonder what happened to you.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:14.500]   And the simplest strategy that I can give is to say, "Pray earnestly for these affections the way the psalmist does and the way Paul does.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.700]   Incline my heart to your testimonies.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.000]   Open my eyes to see wonders.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.800]   Satisfy me in the morning.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.700]   Create in me a clean heart.
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.800]   Renew a right and willing spirit.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.000]   Restore the joy of my salvation."
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.400]   It's amazing to me that the psalmist prays that way, because he's praying like Mark and Chris would want to pray, I think.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.000]   And Paul does the same for his churches.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.500]   He says to the Ephesians in chapter 1, "I remember you in my prayers,
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.900]   asking that the eyes of your hearts would be open so that you know the hope you've been called to,
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.200]   and know the riches of your inheritance, and know the power that's at work in you."
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   And he doesn't mean know like the devil knows.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.800]   I mean, the devil knows these things and hates them.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.200]   He means know like you know honey is sweet when you taste it, and you know velvet is smooth when you touch it,
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:16.900]   and you know that the new-cut grass out in the front is sweet when you smell it.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.700]   That's the kind of knowing Paul is praying for here.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.800]   I do this virtually every day.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.400]   I just want these brothers to know that I'm with them in the fight.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:35.200]   I pray every day for my affections not to die and to be quickened and made lively.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.700]   And the phrase that's right at the top of my prayer list is, "Hallowed be your name."
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.900]   And if you stop and think about the word "hallowed," "sanctified," that is, what you're praying for is,
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:56.000]   "God, help me with my whole being to set your name in a place of great sacredness, and great purity, and great love, and great honor.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.200]   Help me to see and savor the worth of your name with all my heart and soul and mind and strength."
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.000]   So that's right at the top of my prayer list every day, and it's a prayer from my heart.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.400]   So take the Word of God praying.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.400]   That's the key.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.400]   Ephesians 6, what, verse 17, I think.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   "Take the sword of the Spirit, praying at all times."
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.200]   Take the sword praying.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.700]   Take the sword praying.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.700]   Never take the sword by itself.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.100]   Never pray by itself.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:39.600]   Always take the Word of God and pray it into reality in your life, and then bank on one aspect of that sword, namely the promise of God.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.900]   "I will put the fear of me in your hearts, and you will not turn from me."
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:56.400]   So I would say to Mark and Chris and the hundreds of people who share this struggle, God will complete the work that He's begun in us.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.000]   Yes, He will.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.300]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:07.000]   For more on fighting for joy in God, there's a series of messages from a 2005 regional conference, which you can find at DesiringGod.org by searching for the titles "How to Fight for Joy."
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.200]   There you will find three sessions and one question and answer session as well.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:16.700]   Again, those can be found online at DesiringGod.org under the title "How to Fight for Joy," all available free of charge.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.500]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
