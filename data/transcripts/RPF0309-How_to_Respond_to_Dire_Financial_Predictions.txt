[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.800]   Flying direct with Fiji Airways.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.240]   I've had a few doom and gloomers on this show in the last few weeks.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.000]   Some people who make some extremely strong and provocative predictions about the utter
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.880]   collapse of whether it's the world economy or the stock market or whatever, some dire
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.520]   prediction.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.240]   And that's unsettled a few of you.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.720]   I've gotten some emails of people saying, "Josh, well, man, what do I do?"
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.080]   Well, I always try to ask those people, "Okay, practically, what are the practical steps
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.080]   of what to do?"
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.080]   And frankly, I get really frustrated with their answers because I don't find them to
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.400]   be practically useful.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.520]   So today I'm going to tell you what my actions would be or what my advice would be if I were
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:23.600]   advising you or anybody on how to actually practically, actionably prepare and respond
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.920]   to dire financial predictions.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.120]   And we're going to try to do this in a rational and thoughtful manner.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.880]   Let's see if we can make this happen.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:51.960]   You got to be the judge of that.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.880]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.640]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.960]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.360]   I'm so tempted to start this show in the way that Jack Spierko starts his and steal his
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.240]   tagline, teaching you how to invest and live a rich life now and build a plan for financial
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.440]   freedom if everything goes right, or even if it doesn't, or if everything goes wrong,
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.840]   or even if everything goes right.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.840]   That's what I'd really love to steal as a tagline for today's show.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.480]   Now obviously I just stole it.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.080]   So to clarify for those of you who either haven't heard that interview or are not familiar,
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.100]   Jack Spierko, who was on the show a few weeks ago, the tagline for his show is helping you
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.100]   build a better life.
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.640]   Let me see if I can do it.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.800]   Helping you build a better life now if times get tough or even if you don't.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.400]   And the reason I want to steal it is that even though that's an extremely wordy, I guess,
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.840]   slogan, it's really a useful one.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.080]   And it's the one that I think should be applied to every one of these decisions.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.160]   When I talk about how do you actually protect yourself, what do you actually practically
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.680]   do?
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.840]   If you're new to the world of financial discussion, welcome.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.520]   And I hereby warn you that the talk of financial catastrophe and economic, stock market crashes
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:27.120]   and economic doom and gloom, this is a standard component of a discussion of finance.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:37.280]   There's always, always some subset of financial pundits who are predicting economic catastrophe.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.880]   And I want to hurry to assure you that I do not disqualify somebody simply because they
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.520]   are predicting economic catastrophe.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.120]   I think it's a very reasonable and rational concern to have.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.440]   I think it's very reasonable and rational to consider what would happen if we faced
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.440]   a market crash.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.880]   What would happen if there were a collapse of the dollar?
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.500]   What would happen if we faced World War III?
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.320]   What would happen if Donald Trump was elected president?
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.520]   What will happen if Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is elected president?
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.640]   What would happen in these situations?
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.200]   These are all useful and thoughtful things for us to consider, but we've got to focus
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.440]   on how should we respond and not respond in a knee jerk way.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.920]   Let me read you an email.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.720]   This comes from a listener.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.280]   It's representative of other emails as well.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.520]   Let's just call this listener Jay.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.360]   He says, "Joshua, I listened to your episode with Robert Kiyosaki tonight.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.360]   It had me riveted.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.520]   He kind of freaked me out a bit about his dire predictions.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.120]   I've recently built up a little after-tax savings with a betterment account.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.200]   I do have an emergency savings account too, and we have a couple of rentals and a modest
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.360]   401k.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.360]   I wish I had dozens of rentals, but the thought of being over-leveraged always makes me a
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.920]   bit nervous.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.320]   And I have some work to do, settling my wife on slowing down her overall spending, which
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.400]   is killing our financial independence options.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.640]   Anyway, are his predictions legit?
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.680]   Should I really consider buying gold and getting rid of any stock-based investing or betterment
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.680]   or 401k?
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.480]   I promise I'm not asking for your financial advisor advice, just friendly advice.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.920]   I won't hold you to it, I promise.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   Love the show.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.960]   My monthly donation is tiny, but I'm a huge fan.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.960]   Thanks."
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.960]   Jay, thank you for supporting the show.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.560]   Appreciate all of you who do that.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.600]   And I'm going to try to answer it, but I'm going to do it in a practical way.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.920]   And let me get straight to the point so that if anybody tunes out at any point along this
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.880]   episode, here's my advice.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.640]   No, you should not, based upon Robert Kiyosaki's predictions, sell your stocks.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.680]   You should not liquidate your 401k.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.540]   You should not liquidate your betterment account.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.840]   You should not go out and borrow lots of money in a leveraged capacity in real estate, and
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.800]   you should not respond and react to his predictions in an immediate way.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:05.120]   Rather, you should take his discussion, take his predictions, investigate his sources,
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:15.120]   think through his arguments, start studying for yourself, slow down, and systematically
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.600]   take plans to prepare yourself.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.420]   I'm going to give you a bunch of action steps over the course of this show.
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.920]   Before I jump into the meat of our content, sponsor this half hour for today is SoFi.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.840]   SoFi is really just a cool modern company that's trying to revolutionize the world of
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.840]   lending.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.280]   Now, they've got their work cut out to them.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.920]   It's a very profitable industry.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.640]   They have many large competitors, but they're working hard at it.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.640]   Deal is basically this.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.600]   If you have student loans, if you have other debt, consider checking out SoFi for refinancing
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.800]   options for you.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.840]   Consider checking out SoFi and see if you can refinance and consolidate your student
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.840]   loans.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.400]   They might be able to save you some substantial savings on interest costs.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.280]   They lend at a lower rate than many other organizations.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.760]   They have a very simple process.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.880]   I recently received an email from a listener who said, "Hey, the process was simple and
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.880]   routine.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.640]   I was able to cut a bunch of interest off of it.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.640]   Thanks so much."
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.280]   He checked with me to make sure I received my commission for sending you there, and he
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.880]   was receiving his benefit as well.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:23.280]   If you'd like to check it out, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/sofi, S-O-F-I, which is short for social finance,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   and that will forward you through to the SoFi website.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.440]   If you refinance your student loans through that link, you will get a $200 credit to your
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.800]   account.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.220]   If you refinance student loans and also after the refinancing process, also if you refinance
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.280]   personal loans there, you will get a $100 credit to your account.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.280]   So go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/sofi.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.640]   Now, back to Jay's question.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.680]   First thing, how do you protect yourself from dire financial predictions and warnings?
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:59.740]   I think you first have to learn and focus on learning how to not react based upon fear.
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:06.720]   If you ever find yourself, as Jay wrote here, a bit freaked out, you know you've got a problem.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.880]   Now, it's not ... We all face circumstances that can freak us out easily.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.880]   That's not the problem.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.600]   The problem is if we react based upon that, no good decision ever comes from a place of
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.320]   fear.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.160]   When we start to get into fear, now we're moving with the emotional side and not with
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.400]   the rational side of our thinking.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.720]   So how do you conquer fear?
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.920]   Well, depends on the type of fear, but in this context, isolate the cause of your fear
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.560]   and try to think through a scenario and then control for that scenario.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:41.960]   The fear comes from not understanding what you're doing and why you're doing it.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.280]   So slow down, slow down, slow down.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:54.120]   There are a couple of aphorisms that I have heard over the years and have passed along
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.080]   to others that I've thought were particularly helpful.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.960]   I think we violate these aphorisms constantly and we pay the price for it.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.040]   As a financial advisor, I would share these with clients, but frankly, if people followed
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.920]   them, I always wondered how much of my advice they would actually take because it was clear
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.880]   to me that many clients would violate these two aphorisms every time they made a decision.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.480]   Number one, don't invest in anything that you don't understand.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.180]   You ever heard that advice?
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.120]   Don't invest in anything you don't understand.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:36.440]   Many of us have violated that advice constantly throughout our lifetime.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:43.400]   This is one of my issues with the mainstream practice of financial advice, especially when
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.040]   we invest using just publicly traded mutual funds and ETFs and things like that in the
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.800]   broad-based stock market.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.760]   Most of us jump into that with very little understanding.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:58.300]   What's common practice now is we sign up for a job and the employer will automatically
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:03.360]   move our 401k contributions into a life cycle target date retirement fund.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.800]   We're automatically investing our savings in there.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.360]   They'll automatically enroll us.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.240]   Yes, I can make all the arguments as to why that's a good thing, why that contributes
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.800]   to good behavior, why that helps people, but the reality is we're asking people to invest
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.880]   their money in something they don't understand.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.640]   I don't think we should do that.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.440]   Don't invest your money in anything that you don't understand.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.960]   Take that farther.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.240]   Don't start a business in something that you don't understand.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.600]   Slow down and get to the point of understanding what you're doing.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:38.920]   I'm going to give you some specific statistics in a moment on the stock market that many
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.360]   of you will be surprised by.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   Slow down, slow down, slow down.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.560]   The second aphorism here is of course move slow and take your time.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.600]   Here's the piece of advice.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.120]   I believe I can source this one to years ago.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:57.760]   I listened to a Brian Tracy seminar on investing advice and he gave this one.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.480]   He says, "Take as much time learning about an investment as it takes you to earn the
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.800]   money you put into it."
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:10.440]   Now, I don't know if I've ever fully practiced that advice.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:18.180]   I don't know if it's actually fully practicable, but I love the intent behind that.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.020]   Take as much time learning about an investment as it takes you to earn the money you put
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.020]   into it.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:28.320]   If you're going to make a hundred dollar investment, you should probably do a little bit of research.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.840]   Thousand dollar investment, how long does it take you to earn a thousand bucks?
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.960]   If you're going to make a hundred thousand dollar investment or a million dollar investment,
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:41.080]   how much time should you spend researching that investment opportunity?
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.280]   A lot.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:51.000]   Now again, I don't know that it's possible to apply this in the legal sense, in the technical
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.700]   actually following this to perfection, but at least directionally pay attention.
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.300]   Think about the major financial decisions we make in life, especially the major financial
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:09.180]   mistakes that perhaps you and I have made and ask if some of those mistakes wouldn't
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:14.180]   have been avoided if we'd spent a little bit more time in research based upon the size
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.500]   of the financial decision.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:22.080]   I know for me, I probably could have avoided some pretty big mistakes.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:30.560]   Those two aphorisms together should indicate that moving slowly is a good plan.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.160]   I always like, I'm going to be full of aphorisms today, I always like one of the other aphorisms,
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.240]   investments are kind of like buses, a new one comes along every few minutes.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.080]   I had a hard time believing that one when I was younger, but at this point I feel it
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.920]   very strongly.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.920]   Investments are kind of like buses, there'll be a new one along every few minutes.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:53.400]   And the case of actual investments, every few months, every few weeks, every few years,
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.820]   there'll be opportunities.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:01.240]   Are there macro market trends that are really useful if you hit them?
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.240]   Yes.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.520]   But in any market, at any time, you'll be able to find opportunities if you just give
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.720]   a little bit of time.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.640]   There's always a trade that'll come along if you're paying attention, there's an investment
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.800]   deal, there's a deal, they come along consistently.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.720]   So don't move based upon the fear of missing out when it comes to investment decisions.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:29.080]   Now in addition to slow down, slow down, slow down, study, study, study.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.360]   It's your money and you are responsible for it.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:39.240]   So if you have any desire of building wealth, you should take an interest in the subject
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.240]   of wealth.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.200]   You should be studying it in depth.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.400]   I believe you are, that's why you're here listening to this show.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.720]   You're taking that interest, you're working on it.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.960]   I commend and affirm you for that.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:59.880]   That is what will set you apart from many of your fellow investors.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:06.920]   Frankly, I do not know of or see a guaranteed home run for the financial protection of a
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.800]   portfolio in isolation.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.400]   I don't know of one answer to the question of how do I protect my portfolio from an economic
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.400]   crash?
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   I don't know.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.120]   There are lots of strategies that could be implemented in different market conditions
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.800]   depending on the type of portfolio that you have.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:30.400]   But those strategies are going to be very specific to your actual investment plan.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.120]   Just the simple fact of do you own mutual funds or do you own individual stocks or do
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.120]   you own ETFs?
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.800]   Each of those comes with a unique set of strategies that you can apply to protect yourself from
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:48.340]   a market crash, from a prophecy about the market going to pieces.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.320]   Those strategies are complicated and they're specific.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.260]   It's not as simple as get rid of stocks and buy gold.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.000]   It's not.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.640]   I'll do my best in future shows to cover some of those strategies, but they're very particular
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.640]   and very unique.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:10.160]   Frankly, especially when it comes to stock portfolio management, this is my weakest area
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.160]   of professional knowledge.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:17.040]   That's why my show is called Radical Personal Finance, not Radical Investment Management.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.240]   It's my weakest area.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.080]   My strength is on the personal finance and financial planning side.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.680]   My weakness is in investment management.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.400]   I'm constantly looking for intelligent people who have experience in portfolio management.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.320]   I'm constantly looking to figure out how can we bring some of these strategies to the context
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.520]   of an audio format podcast.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.720]   There's so many different aspects of it.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.840]   But here is why I still continue to do a show and my argument as to why even if I do those
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.080]   shows that will be less impactful to the majority of the audience than what I'm going to cover
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.120]   today.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.480]   Most people, most listeners to this show and most people in general do not fundamentally
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.240]   have an investment problem.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:06.160]   For most people, fundamentally a market crash is not going to wipe you out.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:12.380]   If you are using a mainstream financial strategy and you go through a market strategy, as long
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:18.680]   as you don't freak out and sell, chances are that in the fullness of time, the value of
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.480]   your investments will come back.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   Unless you have all of your money invested in one single company that goes completely
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:34.600]   bankrupt and you didn't take any preemptive action, most investments will be self-cleansing.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:40.840]   If you're investing through the use of mutual funds, the mutual fund manager will cleanse
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.020]   the bad investments out over time.
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:49.560]   If you're investing using an unmanaged fund, a passive fund, just simply the index, the
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.660]   way those are structured, that will cleanse the bad investments out.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:17:00.320]   Most companies, though they be rocked back on their heels during a time of massive market
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.640]   disruption, most companies will come back.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.440]   The values of their shares will recover.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:11.760]   Just because the stated nominal value of your investment portfolio declines dramatically,
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:17.480]   that doesn't necessarily mean that the underlying value of your investment has been affected.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.440]   Illustration on this point, if you are living in a house that today has a market value of
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:28.560]   $200,000, that house is delivering to you a certain lifestyle, certain qualities, keeping
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.080]   the rain off, keeping you warm, keeping you cool, giving you a place to have a bed at
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:40.760]   night, that house may decline in value in nominal terms by 30% based upon the local
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:46.820]   real estate markets, but it continues to provide you with those same characteristics of keeping
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.560]   the rain off, keeping you warm or cool, and keeping you a place to sleep at night as it
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.200]   did before.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:58.240]   In a similar way, a good, well-run company might decline in value based upon external
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.400]   circumstances.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:05.200]   The nominal value of that stock might decrease based upon ... Excuse me, the nominal price
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   of that stock might decrease based upon a 30% overall decline, but you still have human
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.800]   beings that are using the capital assets of that business, looking to exploit the market
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.120]   conditions and if a company is well-run, it'll come back.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.040]   You shouldn't be scared of market crashes.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.640]   Here's the reality of market crashes.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:30.760]   The average intra-year peak to trough decline of the stock market is 14%, meaning that in
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:37.360]   any calendar year, the peak to trough, top to bottom decline in the generalized value
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.360]   of the stock market is 14%.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:45.040]   The record highs, the worst years, been up in the 50%.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:52.280]   Back in '29, '30, the other major periods were '87, 2001, and 2008, if you go and look
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.160]   at some of the charts for that.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:04.760]   The best years, down about 6%, but the average intra-year peak to trough decline is 14%,
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:11.840]   which means that if you're sitting there looking at a 10, 15, 20% market decline, although
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:18.160]   you might feel differently, you should say, "Hoh-hum."
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:24.160]   You should expect about a 30% decline every few years and you should be prepared mentally
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:30.120]   and financially for a 50% market decline at least a couple of times during the course
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.360]   of your investment lifetime.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:38.500]   You should be prepared for that if in any way past history is indicative or illustrative
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.960]   or correlates to future events.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.960]   Is that a guarantee?
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.960]   No, of course not.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.480]   Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.840]   We know that, but you should know that going in.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.600]   What happens is when people make bad predictions, then all of a sudden this emotion and these
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.960]   waves of terror grip people, and then you take a 20% decline and you're ready to say,
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.240]   "People are going to come out with machetes and knives and kill me in the street," and
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.680]   it's just not the case.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.680]   That's normal.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.720]   If you can't handle that volatility, nothing wrong with you.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:19.240]   Recognize that you can't handle that volatility and move to something else that's less volatile.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:25.360]   My argument is most people don't fundamentally have an investment problem because if the
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:34.160]   market declined by a substantial percentage, that would not be the biggest impact on their
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.160]   life.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.320]   Let me ask you that question.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:47.360]   If today you woke up and realized and learned that today, yesterday, excuse me, the generalized
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:55.720]   stock market prices of stocks declined in value by 50%, how would your life and lifestyle
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:01.640]   today be affected?
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:08.680]   For the majority of my listeners, the answer would be not a bit today, except for that
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:15.560]   cold feeling in the pit of your stomach, but today your lifestyle would not be affected.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.400]   What about this week?
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.440]   Just an out of the blue stock market crash.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.560]   For the majority of my listeners, this week your lifestyle would not be affected.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:31.880]   The reason why this impact would be minimal is simply because most people are not living
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.880]   on their investments.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:41.000]   Rather, most people are living on their income.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.480]   If you are living on your investments, you're actually not living on your investments, you're
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.320]   living on the income from your investments.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:59.240]   It's your income, and your expenses will get to that, it's your income that sinks you.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:05.200]   Income is what destroys people's finances, the loss of income.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   That's destructive.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.880]   If the market value, the market price of your investments declined, that just simply affects
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.560]   your net worth, but you can't spend net worth.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.080]   You've got to take income and spend that.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:29.400]   My practical advice, if you're expecting a difficult situation, my practical advice is
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:36.760]   ignore your investments, temporarily, and focus on your income.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:42.480]   A market crash will only affect your current lifestyle to the extent that you're living
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:48.620]   on and spending the income from your portfolio, and to the extent that your other sources
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:53.840]   of income are affected by the surrounding environment.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:23:01.640]   Would a market crash, a 50% market crash, have an impact on your lifestyle and mine?
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.160]   Absolutely.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.040]   Will it be an immediate thing simply because of the market crash?
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.040]   No.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.920]   It's the underlying causal factors of that market crash that would result in a change.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.440]   Think back to the flash crash a few years ago.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.060]   Really weird thing, all out of the blue, just the market just plummets.
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.300]   Could never figure out exactly what it was.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:27.420]   Seemed like there were some algorithms that got messed up, but it freaked everybody out.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.580]   That did not affect your lifestyle.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.100]   Didn't affect mine, didn't affect any of our lifestyle.
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.620]   That was a market crash.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.700]   But because of the artificial environment of it, it didn't affect us.
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.100]   I mean, there were some traders that were pretty freaked out, and a lot of people trying
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:47.740]   to figure out what on earth is going on, but that didn't affect you and me.
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:54.260]   Rather, it's the underlying economic factors that will affect us.
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:24:00.660]   Compare that with a market crash like in the late 2000s.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:07.300]   Those market crashes were symptoms of the underlying economic problems, and all of us
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.620]   were affected to some degree by that.
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:19.460]   Now, if you're living on the income from a portfolio, you need to take different steps.
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.860]   I'm going to briefly intend to cover that at the end of this show.
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:29.540]   But if you're not yet living on the income from a portfolio, you shouldn't focus on just
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.660]   the investments.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:36.100]   You should focus on your lifestyle.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.400]   That's what I would emphasize.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.260]   Do you need to manage your investment portfolio?
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.260]   Yes.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.780]   If you make mistakes with your investment portfolio, will that cost you in the result
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.220]   of future income and future dividends?
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.020]   Yes, you should focus there.
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.020]   But you don't need to freak out about that.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:54.900]   Rather, if you're going to freak out about anything, you need to freak out about your
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.380]   actual income, protecting that.
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.580]   Income is the magic key to everything.
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.180]   Everything in your life is based upon your income.
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.820]   So you must assure and insure your income as much as possible.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.820]   How?
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.020]   First, pay attention to your job.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.900]   Because what happens is, let's say that you're in an industry that is going to be affected
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.020]   on the back end.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:22.220]   Stock market crash and all of a sudden you're in a job where, let's keep it very tied to
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.220]   investments.
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:27.220]   The people who would be most affected in the short term by a stock market crash are the
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.500]   financial advisors.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.980]   This is one reason.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:35.300]   When I was earning a significant portion of my income based upon revenues of fees, client
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:40.420]   fees based upon managing investment accounts, I did not want to take my other sources of
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.900]   money and invest a lot of money back into stocks.
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:49.220]   I think if you are a financial advisor whose compensation is tied to the value of your
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:56.100]   client's investments, it's foolish for you to make stock investments a primary and very
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.860]   large portion of your investment portfolio.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.580]   Because what happens?
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.820]   Well, the market declines in value.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.820]   That dramatically affects your income.
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.140]   Your expenses in a financial planning practice are constant.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.140]   So you have high expenses.
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.180]   Now your income is dramatically affected.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.860]   And right when you need some other money, you go and turn to your stock investments
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:17.860]   and, "Oh, wait a second.
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.220]   My million dollar stock account is down to $600,000."
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.740]   Now, some people say, "Boo hoo, you have $600,000."
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:30.220]   The point is, you don't feel really good cashing money out when your portfolio is down 40%.
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:37.020]   So as a financial advisor, if you're in that situation, you need to have your investments
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:42.180]   in something that has a higher probability of being non-correlating.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:48.860]   I want something that doesn't correlate, if at all possible, to the movements of the market.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:54.620]   So the financial advisor would be most affected in the short term because their income is
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.500]   based upon the market value of the stocks.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.900]   Most of their clients are not going to be hugely affected in the short term.
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.060]   Who's next affected?
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.980]   Well, what happens is the financial advisor starts feeling the pinch.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:12.020]   And so the financial advisor lays off some of their staff, one or two staff people that
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.140]   were just on the edge, maybe a marketing assistant or something like that.
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.540]   Those people, because their income is hurt, that has a ripple effect.
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.700]   The financial advisor stops capital investments in their situation.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.240]   They don't buy new computers this month or this quarter.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.140]   They don't go and buy the new trading software.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.300]   They kind of make do with the same financial planning software they've been using for a
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.040]   few years instead of going out and seeing what's the good things.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:39.360]   They don't take the trip to the conference this quarter because they're feeling the pinch.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.180]   They don't take the trip, which is going to incur hotel fees and plane fees and registration
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.180]   fees.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.100]   They just decide to stay home and just save that money.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.900]   They pull back a little bit on the golf games.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.540]   And all those things have the ripple effect.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.300]   And that's what happens.
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.980]   That's how market crashes affect.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.580]   It's not the crash.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.060]   It's all the ripple effects.
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:06.220]   It's the underlying weakness that is illustrated in the crash.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.820]   And it's also all those ripple effects.
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:12.580]   So you got to pay attention to your income.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:19.400]   Make sure that if you're on a financial advisor's staff that you're not the expendable one.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.840]   Make sure that you're the valuable one.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.220]   Pay attention to your job.
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:27.220]   Be valuable.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.980]   Be valuable.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:37.420]   If you can maintain your income source through just about any recession, depression, stock
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.900]   market crash, etc., you can come out okay on the other side.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:50.660]   If you lose your income source, or sources, you're in a difficult, difficult spot.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:55.680]   So spend your time focusing on your income.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.640]   Make sure that when there's a list of employees who need to be laid off, do everything you
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.880]   can to be at the bottom of that list instead of at the top.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:09.900]   And then do everything you can to make sure that when you do get laid off, it's easy for
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.440]   you to get going again.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.440]   Establish your reputation.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.760]   Build your connections.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.280]   Make sure that you are the go-to person in your industry.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.280]   Establish yourself as an expert.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.400]   I'm working on a course right now.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:26.380]   It's a working title is How to Establish Yourself as a Leading Expert in Your Field.
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.380]   Something along those lines.
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.900]   I'll come up with some better marketing term for it.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.460]   But basically, it's the point is this, is how to establish yourself as the go-to expert
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.140]   so that you don't have to do this hard work of trotting around saying to everyone, "Please,
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.140]   please consider me."
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.640]   Rather, people come to you and say, "Please consider us."
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.640]   You can do it.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:47.200]   If you haven't listened, go back and listen to episode 192, 193, and 194 of the show.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.520]   That was my effort to try to say, "Hey, we need to pay attention to this."
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:57.480]   The titles of those shows, 192 was called Recession is Coming, How Not to Get Laid Off
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.800]   in the Next Recession.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   Guess what?
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.920]   Recession is still coming and you still need to make sure you don't get laid off in the
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.920]   next recession.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:09.640]   193 was called Make a Backup Plan in Case You Do Get Laid Off in the Coming Recession,
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.960]   Simple Action Steps for You to Consider.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.960]   Guess what?
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.600]   No matter how hard you work not to get laid off in the next recession, you might still
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.800]   get laid off, so you need a backup plan.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:24.720]   And 194 is called this, You Just Got Laid Off, Here's What to Do Next.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.200]   So that's the show where if you did just get laid off, you might need some of that information.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.400]   Go back and listen to those shows.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:35.360]   That's an expansion on this concept, but basically everything is based upon income.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:45.600]   So think first and foremost about your income and assure that and insure that.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.360]   Now how do you protect in case you do lose your income?
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.960]   Well, the first thing is savings.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.480]   I would suggest to you that if you don't have money that is safe from market volatility,
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.960]   I think you've made a poor decision.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.000]   No matter your life stage.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.600]   It's the fact that you don't have money that's insulated from that market volatility that's
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.560]   the problem, not the market volatility.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:12.360]   We've all heard it a million times, don't risk money you can't afford to lose.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.520]   Well, okay, good.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.600]   But the question is, are you risking money that you can't afford to lose?
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.920]   You know what, frankly, many people, if not most, I'm making these percentages up so I'm
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:28.240]   trying to be careful with my language, but many people have done exactly that.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:34.720]   The only real material savings they have are, first, majority of people don't have savings.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:39.600]   And if they do have savings, the only real savings are either in home equity and/or in
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.040]   possibly a 401k.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:50.600]   It's trouble because if you face market volatility, you have money that's a very illiquid asset,
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.960]   takes a lot of time, a lot of emotional energy, and a lot of expense to sell a house.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.720]   And all of a sudden when there might be ripple effects and markets are down, people aren't
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.820]   feeling so confident, it's kind of tough to sell a house.
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.640]   Most houses that people own are not very marketable.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.760]   It takes a lot of money to bring them up to a marketable condition.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.360]   If you've ever sold a house and real estate agent says, "You got to shine this thing up,"
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   guess what?
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.120]   You got to have money to get the work done to shine that thing up, get it ready for the
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.240]   market.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.960]   So what happens in many people's situations, they face this double whammy.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:30.680]   They don't have very much money, if any, in liquid savings, just money sitting in a savings
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.420]   account, money market funds, safe dollars.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.760]   They don't have any non-risky assets.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.380]   They don't have any money in life insurance, cash values.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.240]   They don't have any money in an old fixed annuity.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.440]   They don't have any money in CDs.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:49.760]   Rather, any money that they do have is in equity in their house or in their 401k.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.240]   Market conditions get funky, 401k goes down in value.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.320]   The only way they have access to the 401k is through the use of a 401k loan, which can
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.200]   be troublesome, especially if they're about to get laid off or if they just got laid off.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.020]   Also can be expensive to access the money, and most people don't have much money there.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.560]   So you get a whammy upon whammy.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.960]   I don't know how many is a double whammy, triple whammy, quadruple whammy, but now in
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.800]   order to access the money in a 401k, they got to sell investments when the market's
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:20.480]   down, they got to pay taxes and fees and possibly interest, and the money's difficult to get
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.980]   out.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.680]   So that's a problem.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:30.480]   And then on the flip side, in thinking about selling the home, most people move too slowly.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.680]   They don't have the money to shine the house up, so now they got to retail.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.200]   Instead of being able to get a retail price for it, the house is a little bit ugly, so
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.880]   they got to get a wholesale price for it.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.760]   Sell it to an investor who can spiff it up and flip it.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.600]   Well, that cuts out a good amount of money.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.480]   They got to sell quickly because they need money, so now they can't wait for a good offer.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.400]   They're feeling the pressure, so there you got to drop the price.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.520]   And all of a sudden now, people are not feeling so confident.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.960]   The majority of people aren't rushing out and saying, "Oh, let me go buy a house.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.960]   World's going great.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.960]   The stock market's going great.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.120]   The economy, everything's going wonderful, so let's just run out and buy a big expensive
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.600]   house."
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:16.520]   So that's why the average person, most of your and my neighbors, get hammered.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.840]   It's not necessarily just the market volatility.
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.040]   It's the fact that they didn't do planning, so we need savings.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:25.600]   You need money that is safe from market volatility, and if you don't have that money and if you
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.800]   don't have a lot of it, I think you've made some poor decisions.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.800]   Now we've all done that.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.200]   I'm not trying to be insulting.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.920]   I'm just pointing out this is the reality.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.360]   You broke the aphorism of don't invest money you can't afford to lose, but you broke it
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.880]   because, "Oh, it's just putting money in the 401(k)."
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.080]   That's one of my issues with the mainstream financial advisor community is that we teach
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.720]   that but we're slow to actually implement it.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.880]   We tell people, "Put the money right in the 401(k), put the money in the Roth IRA, et
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.880]   cetera.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.000]   Get it invested."
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.120]   And I recognize the reason we do that.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.720]   It's because we're working so hard to get people to actually cross that hurdle and stop
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.240]   spending the money and to invest it.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.680]   But you're not an average person if you're listening to this show.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.960]   Let's talk about expense.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.800]   Savings is the core because savings gives you basically income that you could spend.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:15.240]   If you had a year of savings, say your expenses are $4,000 a month and you got 50 grand sitting
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:22.480]   in a savings account there, you're going to feel a lot better and you've got a year's
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.200]   worth of expenses covered.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.800]   Savings is the primary buttress.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.880]   This is incidentally one of the keys if you are living off of the income from your investment
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.240]   portfolio.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:48.400]   Having substantial amounts of savings makes a huge difference in your comfort level.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.960]   If I get to the point in the future where I'm living on the income from a portfolio,
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:59.240]   I would always be seeking to maintain two years, two to three, something like that,
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:05.000]   at least two to three years of expenses just sitting in a savings account somewhere.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.600]   Because I know if I can get through two or three years without having to affect my lifestyle,
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.600]   two or three years makes a huge difference in markets.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.720]   Two or three years gets you from 2008 to 2011.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:22.920]   Go run the numbers, that makes a big difference in the value of your portfolio.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:27.880]   So savings, if you don't have savings, that's your action step.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.400]   I wouldn't run out and sell all money in my 401k.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.280]   If I don't have any savings, I might move a little bit of it to a safe point.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.840]   I might move a little bit of it into a cash fund or cash equivalent or I might reduce
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.680]   my contributions a little bit.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.840]   I'd stop putting money in the stock account and I'd just start putting money in the savings
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.080]   account.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:52.000]   Because the other thing the savings buys you is it buys you purchasing power when everyone
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.160]   else doesn't have any.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:37:02.240]   I mean I've tried to be as open as I'm comfortable being with my own personal investment plans,
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.600]   but frankly I'm a contrarian.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.680]   I want to be sitting on cash ready to buy deals when they're available.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.880]   I want to have the network built.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.360]   I want to have the deals be coming to me.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.560]   I want to have the cash set aside.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.200]   I want to have the sources of financing.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.600]   I want to be there and be ready when the world is going crazy.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   Because guess what?
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.180]   It always goes crazy.
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.200]   It's just a predictable cycle.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.560]   I want to be ready.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.680]   I wasn't ready the last time.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.760]   I wasn't ready in 2008.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.760]   So I don't know.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.760]   Is it 2016?
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.760]   Is it 2020?
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.760]   I have no idea.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.620]   I'm going to keep working productively along the way, but I'm going to be ready and I suggest
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:37.620]   you are too.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.340]   Next, expenses.
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.260]   This is the other key thing.
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:49.520]   What destroys people is they lose their income and they don't have savings or don't have
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:54.000]   enough, and their expenses are too high.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.960]   And that leads to stress.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:04.880]   That leads to them raiding whatever's left of the 401k at a far too high of a rate compared
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.520]   to if they had just been a little bit more under control with their expenses.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.080]   So how can you buttress yourself against having your expenses destroy you?
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.120]   Well, let's start with the big one.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:19.880]   Pre-committed income, aka debt.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.360]   What do you do when you borrow money?
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:27.020]   Well, you are committing yourself to a cash outflow in advance.
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:32.420]   If you've pre-committed your future income in the form of a debt obligation, then when
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:37.360]   your income is hurt, now you're really hurting because you weren't necessarily planning on
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.880]   that.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:44.480]   So some simple rules with debt, try don't borrow money.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:50.220]   Or if you do borrow money, make sure that you don't borrow money that's not connected
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.700]   to another source of cash flow.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:57.180]   Don't borrow money for assets that don't produce income for you.
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:01.120]   It's crazy to borrow money for things that don't create income.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.920]   And this is the situation that we face in a consumption society.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.840]   I got a car payment.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.200]   I got a motorcycle payment.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.720]   I got a student loan payment.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.600]   That one makes me a little bit of tiny income maybe.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.920]   Got a house payment.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.900]   And none of those things create income.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.160]   So when the income dries up, everyone's destroyed.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.840]   Now compare that to Jay here was talking about a real estate.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:26.360]   So that's the most simple, actionable way for us to think about it.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:31.920]   If you borrowed money on an asset that creates income for you, and if you have some margin
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.320]   there, if you lose the income for a month or two, you're not sunk.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.260]   All you got to do is come up with a month or two of payments, and then you get another
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.240]   tenant in there, or three months or whatever it winds up being.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.560]   And you get another tenant in there, and then you're okay.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:50.000]   But if you lose your income from your job, the car payment continues tricking, continuing
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   on.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.280]   And the only way you can make income off of that is, I don't know, go drive on Uber, something
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.280]   like that.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:02.000]   It would be an interesting study to think about and to see what happens to the Uber
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.320]   prices, or Uber and Lyft, how much they pay their drivers during a period of high unemployment.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.920]   That would be an interesting study to pay attention to.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:14.480]   Any of you journalists or authors or whatever in the financial fields, I don't know, to
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:18.120]   me that strikes me, that's a story headline I would read.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:26.080]   So focus on clearing the debt, and that's something you can do now.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:31.120]   The other thing you can do with debt is control the terms of it.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:36.280]   The better the terms are for you of your debt, the better things are.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.920]   So if you have non-recourse debt, where the person to whom you owe money can't come after
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:47.200]   you for something if you aren't able to make your debt payments, those types of things
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.200]   are important.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:53.760]   If you have a lot of margin, was working with somebody recently here, and they owe too much
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.680]   on their car, well, there's no margin.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.640]   They don't have any money, and they can't sell the car and just be free of the debt.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:05.280]   If you can just destroy a debt encumbrance and just get your $300 a month back, it's
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.480]   a lot easier to give up whatever you paid into it just to have that $300 a month back.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.560]   So that's why debt is so destructive.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.880]   Consumer debt is incredibly destructive when times get tough.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.000]   What other expenditures, what other budget categories?
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:27.560]   Well, you can plan ahead and be willing to reduce some of your budget categories on a
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.960]   voluntary basis.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:35.760]   You can also stockpile some of the things that you need and eliminate some of the financial
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.760]   risk.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.880]   You can buy, I've talked about this in the past with the alpha strategy, but you can
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.880]   buy all the things that you're going to need for the future.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.300]   I want to give you some examples of how this is really practical planning.
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.560]   The idea is buy the things that you're going to need in the future now while times are
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.920]   good.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:59.880]   And then you'll be in a better situation where if times go bad, you're not going to be quite
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.080]   so hugely affected.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:10.120]   And by buying things you need or are going to need anyway, you can go ahead and get the
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.440]   benefit of those and you're fine and you're happy if everything goes great and we don't
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.480]   face a market crash.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.600]   And if we do face a market crash, whatever the definition of that is, then you're still
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.600]   okay.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.320]   It frustrates me so much when people don't recognize the fact that their predictions
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.200]   could be wrong.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.560]   It frustrates me when people speak with absolute certainty.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.920]   When Robert Kiyosaki or Ann Barnhart are just saying, "Well, this is absolutely going to
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.280]   happen," I'm sorry, you don't know that it's absolutely going to happen.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.960]   I don't know that it's absolutely going to happen.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:45.080]   So I prefer to take a little bit more of a reasonable approach and say, "This is a possibility.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:49.840]   How would this possibility affect my life and how can I make a plan so that if this
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:55.400]   happens, I'm going to be as comfortable as possible?"
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.760]   So let me go through some budget categories and give you some examples.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.440]   I pulled up an article I just found with a quick web search.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.240]   70 plus basic personal budget categories.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   Food.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.240]   You can't...
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.240]   Food.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.880]   Groceries, restaurant, pet food, and trees.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.880]   Groceries.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.880]   What can you do now?
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.760]   Well, you can practice skills of frugality, knowing how to cook less expensively and you
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.440]   can plan ahead.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:25.800]   In my family, if we were experiencing significant financial shortfall, I know absolutely how
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:30.640]   we could transition our budget to cheaper sources of food.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:35.320]   We have some decisions just enjoying the luxuries of life and some of the health aspects of
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.200]   why we don't choose to go as hardcore as we could.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.700]   But if you know that you could cut a few hundred dollars out of your budget because you've
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.120]   practiced it or you've thought about it or you've researched it, that can make a big
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.480]   difference.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.480]   Shelter.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.560]   Mortgage, rent, property taxes, household repairs, and HOA dues.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:57.080]   If you know your house is due for some things, you need a new roof, you need a new appliances,
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:02.240]   things like that, it might behoove you to go ahead and do those things instead of putting
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.240]   them off.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.840]   Because if you put them off and then if you have the cash and you put them off, you're
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:10.160]   not going to feel so good about doing it in a time of market crash.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.720]   And if you know you're going to have needed repairs and you're worried about sometime
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.280]   in the future there's going to be a situation, better to have it done today and have the
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:25.160]   benefit of it than to wish for it.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.200]   I'm pausing because I'm arguing in my head that you might get a better deal.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.400]   If you have a lot in the future, if you have a lot of savings, then some of these things
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.840]   you should consider waiting.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:37.680]   If it's not necessary, just make sure you have enough savings and I tell you in difficult
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.480]   times you can buy some things for a lot cheaper than in good times.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:47.240]   Utilities, electricity, water, heating, garbage, phones, cable, internet, think through those
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:52.040]   things in advance and know what you could cut, know how you could cut it.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.200]   You don't have to actually cut it all.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.560]   You don't have to go around turning every light off and adjusting the thermostat and
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.600]   canceling the cable and all that stuff, but at least know that you could and think it
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   through.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:06.040]   Transportation, fuel, tires, oil changes, maintenance, parking fees, repairs, etc.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:10.920]   Doing some of those things in advance can be really helpful and really useful.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.800]   Medical care, going ahead and getting the dental work done or getting the medical work,
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:15.800]   those types of things.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.280]   So, you can transition some of those things that you need and you go ahead and do it knowing
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:25.160]   that you've reduced or eliminated future expenses.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:30.560]   So, can you stockpile some things that you need?
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:37.320]   I think it makes a lot of sense to focus on building out some resiliency by having the
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.880]   physical items that you would buy with money.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:47.040]   So, I've tried to profile a lot of the survivalists and their approach to things.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:53.480]   I think if you focus on providing for the physical needs that you have, if you know
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:58.240]   you have a month or two or three months or six months of food available to you where,
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:01.200]   "Hey, if my income dried up, I'm okay.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.080]   I got enough money to feed my family."
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.160]   If you've thought in advance about the toiletries that you've needed, you've gone ahead and
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:13.480]   purchased those things, you build a level of strength and resiliency in your lifestyle.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.520]   I think that's a really valuable thing to consider.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:22.040]   It's hard for me to imagine and you got to do this in proportion to your life, but the
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:26.680]   most practical useful advice, like I can't stand people when, listen, Anne Barnhart talks
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.040]   about like, "Got to go out and buy guns and bullets."
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:35.360]   Listen, I've never been in a gunfight in my life, but I eat every day.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:41.360]   I don't ever want to be in a gunfight in my life, but I want to eat most days.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.840]   I can't stand it when people say, "Buy bullets."
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:45.840]   This is fantasy.
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.280]   It's a fantasy world.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:53.440]   It's absurd, but there is certainly a good case to be made for the fact that you might
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.840]   need to have some food when you can't buy it.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.680]   I can't stand it when people say, "Go and buy gold."
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.920]   My favorite, I've had James Wesley Rawls on the show a few times.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.920]   One thing that I appreciate about James is he's actually a reasonable guy.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.880]   He has some strong convictions about his predictions for the future, but he's a reasonable guy
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.760]   and he takes a reasonable approach to things.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:21.800]   His basic survivalism mentality is to say, "Don't buy silver and gold until you've secured
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:25.020]   all the things that you're going to need for your life.
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:29.200]   Don't buy silver and gold until you have your food and your water and your means of purifying
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.020]   water and all of that stuff."
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.800]   Those things are actually useful and practical.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.760]   I can't stand the, "Buy gold" advice.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.480]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:42.560]   Gold doesn't do you any good in many situations except after the fact.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:49.160]   This concept of, "We're going to somehow take gold bars and barter with one another," it's
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.160]   fantasy.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:58.120]   First, people don't have any ability to understand the actual value of gold.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:02.100]   Go on YouTube, search some of the gold bugs and pull up some of their stuff.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:07.560]   These guys will walk around on the street with a video camera, but the video's on YouTube,
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:13.000]   and they'll offer people a one-ounce gold coin if they can get within a few hundred
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.360]   dollars of the value of it.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.920]   I remember in the past, gold was what?
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.920]   $2,000 an ounce.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.800]   They're walking around with a $2,000 gold coin and they're offering it to people.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.800]   People are saying, "What?
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   50 bucks?
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.800]   30 bucks?"
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.600]   People have no concept of the value of it.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.720]   This idea that somehow we're going to go to a gold-based economy is – I think it's
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.000]   a little bit silly.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   What's better than that?
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   Well, theoretically, silver.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   You can get into the whole discussion.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.240]   I'll do a show on it sometime.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:43.000]   But if you're going to go to a barter economy, don't buy gold until you've bought silver
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   dimes.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.560]   It's a much more practical amount of currency.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:52.960]   Does that mean that you shouldn't buy gold?
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:53.960]   I don't think so.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:59.240]   I think there's a really good case to be made for everybody having some gold coins,
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.200]   but that's not going to help you in a market crash.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:07.800]   That's so that you have something that's one of those assets that can insure some of
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.520]   your wealth and you got to know when are you going to sell it on the back end.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.680]   So I don't want to go into gold today.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.560]   My point is just that it's not practical.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:19.280]   This advice of buy gold and guns is – I mean, I get where they're coming from, but
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.200]   it's not practical.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.560]   What I'm giving you is practical and start with this stuff.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.920]   And then, hey, if you want to buy gold coins, go for it.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:28.920]   I like gold coins.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:29.920]   I like guns.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:30.920]   That's cool.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:35.120]   But I'm not going to be shooting people in West Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.200]   There's no chance of that.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:43.620]   So invest in the things that you need and then invest in useful capital.
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:47.680]   So if you're in business, think about what can you do to enhance – what's the useful
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.240]   capital that you can buy?
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.560]   Look for investments that make sense.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:58.760]   Don't get caught up in fear about a doomsday scenario.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.760]   Recognize that the things that you can do to prepare for that are very simple.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.040]   And guess what?
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.920]   Let's say that I'm completely wrong because I fully acknowledge that I could be.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.440]   I think about this stuff a lot.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.040]   Let's say that I'm wrong.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.280]   Let's say there's a massive economic crash.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.280]   Let's say we go into World War III.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:20.720]   Let's say that the zombies are running in the streets with machine guns.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.080]   Guess what?
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:27.280]   Everything that I've described and more is still going to help.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.440]   Now in that situation, I'm going to wish that I'd done what James Wesley Rawls told
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.440]   me to do.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:35.920]   I'm going to wish I moved to Idaho and bought a 500-acre ranch, but I'm not there.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.920]   I can't do that.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:37.920]   I'm not at a place for that.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:42.680]   I'm probably going to wish it, but everything else is going to help.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:46.560]   Because when you look at the underpinnings of an economy, it's all based on relationships.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:50.560]   This is to my final point in today's show.
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:54.000]   Invest in relationships.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.800]   Build relationships in your community.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:00.120]   Build relationships in your family.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.620]   Because when you get into difficult times and you study the times of economic collapse
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.880]   in the past, that's where the benefit has been.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:11.180]   If you need capital to invest in something in difficult times and banks aren't lending
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:16.120]   money because their stock is down and they're all freaking out, where do you get that?
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.120]   You get it from the rich people that you know in your town.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:21.560]   You get it from the people you know who have the capital.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:26.320]   Work on building the relationships and building the community that you need now.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.720]   You lost your job.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:29.720]   You got kicked out of your house.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:34.400]   Wouldn't it be nice to have some quality family relationships to fall back on that you could
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:41.300]   quickly go and live with somebody, a family member, and actually have that be a pleasant
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.300]   experience?
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.300]   That takes time.
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:44.300]   It takes investment.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:54.420]   To sum up today's show, maximize your income, minimize your expenses.
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:52:00.620]   Maximize your protection, minimize your obligations.
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:08.860]   Minimize your choices and options, and minimize the entrenchment of your current position.
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:14.820]   Take those ideas and look at all of your current affairs, and what you'll see is that all the
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:20.540]   stuff that you would need to be doing in a market crash is all the same stuff that you
[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:25.660]   should be doing today no matter what.
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:31.380]   When you recognize that, you realize that you don't have to worry about the market crash.
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:34.340]   The markets crash, markets go up.
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:39.660]   Things change all the time, but it's the same skills, and it's the same activities, and
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:47.920]   it's the same habits done reliably and consistently all along the way that lead to the strongest
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:48.920]   of results.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.900]   I think it's so valuable to think about market crashes.
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:58.940]   I think it's so valuable to think about dire economic prognostications, and ask yourself,
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.180]   how would I handle this?
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:05.980]   Because that will improve your risk management skills.
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:10.900]   Here's where I want to go back to Jay's email and just touch on these things and show how
[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:12.900]   this applies.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:17.060]   I've recently built up a little after-tax savings with a Betterment account.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.340]   I do have an emergency savings account too.
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:21.780]   Jay, that's what you need.
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:24.740]   You want to look at that and say, "Am I comfortable with the size of that?"
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.060]   You should be doing that at all stages.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.420]   We have a couple of rentals and a modest 401(k).
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.180]   That's what you need.
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:33.260]   That's what you need to get you through a market crash.
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:36.180]   You've got a couple of rentals and an emergency savings account.
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.580]   You've got some income.
[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:42.700]   Then you're in a situation where if your 401(k) goes down and your Betterment account goes
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:43.940]   down, you still have real estate.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:44.940]   You still have savings.
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.060]   That's what you should be doing.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:50.260]   I wish I had dozens of rentals, but the thought of being over-leveraged always makes me a
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.460]   bit nervous.
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:54.020]   It should.
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.460]   You should never be over-leveraged.
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:54:01.860]   I don't buy this nonsense about borrowing $500 million and buying real estate.
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:07.820]   Now, I'm willing to be wrong, but I don't buy it until I see some proof.
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:11.180]   Doesn't happen.
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:14.260]   You should not be over-leveraged.
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:17.660]   Even when you're using leverage, you're always thinking about what's the worst-case scenario.
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:21.220]   When you're looking at your real estate portfolio, you should look at it and say, "Let's assume
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.900]   the worst-case scenario.
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:27.340]   How would I fare and how can I minimize my risk?"
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:31.300]   Maybe you'll get busy and pay off this property and you'll refinance this debt here to better
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:32.660]   terms.
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:34.860]   That's exactly what you should do.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:38.300]   Goes on anyway, "Are his predictions legitimate?"
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.300]   Of course they're legitimate.
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.180]   He's making the predictions.
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.180]   Guess what?
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.820]   There's always somebody making predictions.
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:49.140]   Now, to Kiyosaki's benefit, I haven't read his book, Prophecy, in years.
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:52.300]   It's probably been updated, but just go down to Barnes & Noble.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.300]   Do what I do.
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:57.300]   Every few months, go down to the local bookstore and just browse and there's always a new book
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.860]   on prophecy.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:04.180]   There's always a new financial prognosticator saying, "This is going to be the year."
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:07.900]   Now, I don't know if this is going to be the year or not, and I don't know how to know
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:09.940]   if this is going to be the year or not.
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:12.940]   If you want to pick a guru that knows, go for it.
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:17.360]   All I know is I've seen a lot of gurus get embarrassed and be wrong.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:21.220]   What I choose to do is to recognize that could happen.
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.220]   Let me make a plan for it.
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.540]   Let me also make a plan in case it doesn't happen.
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:29.060]   Should I really consider buying gold and getting rid of any stock-based investment better than
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.060]   401(k)?
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.100]   Sure, you should consider it.
[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:33.100]   Should you do it?
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:34.940]   Well, that's going to depend.
[00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:38.900]   Can you handle the volatility of the stock market?
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:40.620]   If not, you probably should get out.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:45.980]   I think a lot of people should get out of the broad-based stock market because they
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:48.420]   can't handle the volatility and they make stupid decisions.
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:52.660]   They have bad financial advisors who can't coach them through the corrections and the
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:54.620]   crashes and whatnot.
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:59.260]   I think a lot of people would be much better served in investing all that money in some
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.060]   other capacity.
[00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:04.100]   I really do.
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:05.740]   But I'm not finding fault with the stock market.
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:10.300]   In the stock market, you pay the price for your returns by being willing to sit through
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.300]   the volatility.
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:13.660]   Now, should you consider buying gold?
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.740]   Yes, you should consider it.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.180]   So here's my challenge to you.
[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:23.900]   Consider it and understand why you should buy it, when you should buy it, and then when
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:26.620]   you should sell it.
[00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:31.180]   What is your purpose for it?
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.520]   What are you going to do with it?
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:34.980]   What benefit does it bring you?
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:35.980]   What's your plan for it?
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:37.540]   What percentage is appropriate?
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:40.700]   Now I know I'm supposed to be giving you those answers and hope I'm not copying out.
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:44.260]   I'm just trying to wrap up the show and say, "Yes, you should consider those things just
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:47.460]   like you should consider the scenario of any person."
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:49.580]   It's why I try to bring such a diversity of guests.
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:50.580]   Do I do it great?
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:51.580]   I don't know.
[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:57.860]   But I'm trying to present a huge variety of perspectives and opinions, and you should
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:00.300]   consider what anybody has to say.
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:03.980]   But at the end of the day, you are responsible for your money.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.700]   You're responsible to do the research.
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:11.980]   You're responsible to understand what you're doing and why.
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:14.820]   You're responsible.
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:17.500]   Pay attention to that responsibility.
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.460]   Learn from everybody.
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:20.460]   Incorporate new research.
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:23.660]   When somebody mentions a book, mentions something, buy the book.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:25.460]   I'm going to listen to podcasts.
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:28.140]   First thing I do, somebody recommends a book, I stop.
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:31.500]   If I think it's going to be valuable, pull out my phone, pull out the Amazon app, buy
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:32.500]   a used copy.
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:35.620]   You usually pay a penny and $3.99 of shipping.
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:38.180]   Just click, one click buy, done.
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:39.180]   Now come look through that book.
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.180]   Do I agree with this author?
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.940]   Do they have something I haven't seen before?
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:43.300]   Is there some thought here?
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:47.620]   Is there something that I can gain from what they're having to say?
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:48.620]   And look for the information.
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:52.740]   And when you make a habit of doing that, you slow down, you do your research, you study,
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:53.780]   study, study.
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:58:00.860]   Then what'll happen is you won't respond to these predictions from a place of fear, but
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:05.540]   you'll have a confidence that you know what you're doing and you know why you're doing
[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:06.540]   it.
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:09.140]   You know where your blind spots are and you know you can get through.
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:11.060]   And you know what?
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:14.500]   That's what will transform you into a millionaire.
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:18.340]   And that's what will transform you into the type of person that could be picked up, placed
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:21.900]   in almost any society, in almost any place in the world.
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:25.260]   As long as there's a little bit of freedom and enough advantages, you can apply those
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:26.260]   same skills.
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:29.260]   And if you lose it all, you can build it right back.
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:37.300]   One of the most amazing things for you to study in the future is look at how many times
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:41.460]   self-made millionaires have lost it all and gotten it back again.
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:46.020]   It's really, really astounding when you start looking at it.
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:49.660]   It seems like most millionaires have to lose it all a couple of times till they finally
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.340]   get their risk management down.
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:53.540]   So I don't think it's required.
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:56.140]   I think you learn vicariously.
[00:58:56.140 --> 00:59:06.180]   But the key is the thought process and who you become and the process that you apply.
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.180]   Hope that's helpful to you all.
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:08.780]   It's my best way of answering it.
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:11.060]   I guess I've seen so many people.
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:13.740]   In 2008, I watched so many people.
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:15.540]   I'm going to freak out.
[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:16.540]   Cash out my 401k.
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:18.900]   Buy a bunch of silver coins.
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:24.300]   How's that working for you?
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.300]   Not so well.
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:26.300]   Thank you all for listening.
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:30.020]   I appreciate the time and attention that you have honored me with today.

[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:43.860]   share with me.

[01:00:32.500 --> 01:01:01.460]   Bye.
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:04.040]   (upbeat music)
