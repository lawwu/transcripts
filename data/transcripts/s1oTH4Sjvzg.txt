[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940]   And the outcome here is a horrific man-made famine,
[00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.140]   not a natural disaster, not bad harvest,
[00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.720]   but a man-made famine as a result of then the compulsion
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.400]   that gets used by the Soviet state
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.220]   to extract those resources,
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.900]   corning off the area, not allowing starving people to escape.
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.740]   You put very well some of the implications
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.500]   of this case study in how things look
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.720]   in the abstract versus in practice.
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.420]   And those phenomena were going to haunt
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.960]   the rest of the experience of the Soviet Union.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.280]   The whole notion that up and down the chain of command,
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.980]   everybody is falsifying or tinkering with
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.860]   or prettifying the statistics or their reports
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.420]   in order not to look bad and not to have vengeance
[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.080]   visited upon them, reaches the point where nobody,
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.220]   in spite of the pretense of comprehensive knowledge,
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.220]   there's a state planning agency that creates five-year plans
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.400]   for the economy as a whole,
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.820]   and which is supposed to have accurate statistics,
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.820]   all of this is founded upon a foundation of sand.
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.300]   A deliberate plan to bring class conflict
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.700]   and bring civil war and then heighten it
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.080]   in the countryside does damage.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.220]   And not least of that is this phenomenon
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.080]   of a negative selection.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.980]   Those who have most enterprise,
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.900]   those who are most entrepreneurial,
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.740]   those who have most self-discipline,
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.980]   those who are best organized,
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.980]   will be winnowed again and again and again,
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.540]   sending the message that mediocrity
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.740]   is comparatively much safer than talent.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.400]   Hitler and Himmler envisioned permanent war
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.800]   on the Eastern Front, not a peace treaty,
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.280]   not a settlement, not a border,
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.960]   but a constant moving of the border
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.720]   every generation, hundreds of miles east,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.000]   in order to keep winning more and more living space.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.620]   And with analogy to other frontiers,
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.600]   to always give more fighting experience
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.620]   and more training in aggression
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.780]   to generation after generation of German soldiers.
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.740]   In terms of nightmarish visions,
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.180]   this one's right up there.
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.320]   - The following is a conversation with Weihas Ludwig Wischus,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.500]   a historian specializing in Germany and Eastern Europe.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.380]   He has lectured extensively on the rise,
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.740]   the reign, and the fall of communism.
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.120]   Our discussion goes deep on this,
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.100]   the very heaviest of topics,
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.660]   the communist ideology that has led
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.100]   to over 100 million deaths in the 20th century.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.800]   We also discuss Hitler, Nazi ideology, and World War II.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.960]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.340]   in the description.
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.740]   And now, dear friends, here's Weihas Ludwig Wischus.
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.600]   Let's start with Karl Marx.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.380]   What were the central ideas of Marx
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.580]   that lay the foundation of communism?
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.260]   - I think there were several key ideas that Marx deployed
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.380]   that were destined to have such an impact.
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.940]   And in some ways, they were actually kind of contradictory.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.500]   On the one hand, Marx insisted that history has a purpose,
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.060]   that history is not just random events,
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.220]   but that rather it's history, we might say,
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.180]   with a capital H, history moving in a deliberate direction,
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.520]   history having a goal,
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.940]   a direction that it was predestined to move in.
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.980]   At the same time, in "The Communist Manifesto,"
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.940]   Karl Marx and his colleague Friedrich Engels
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.020]   also suggested that there was a role
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.460]   for special individuals who might,
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.860]   even if history was still moving
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.660]   in this predetermined direction,
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.100]   might give it an extra push,
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.100]   might play a heroic role in that process.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.140]   And I think that these two ideas added together,
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.740]   the notion that there is a science of revolution
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.420]   that suggests that you can move in a deliberate
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.820]   and meaningful, rational way towards the end of history
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.140]   and the resolution of all conflicts,
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.380]   a total liberation of the human person,
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.460]   and that moreover, that was inevitable,
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.660]   that that was pre-programmed and destined
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.380]   in the order of things.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.180]   When you add to that the notion
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.100]   that there's also room for heroism and the individual role,
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.940]   this ended up being tremendously powerful as a combination.
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.340]   Earlier thinkers who were socialists
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.420]   had already dreamt of or projected futures
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.140]   where all conflict would be resolved
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.620]   and human life would achieve some sort of perfection.
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.100]   Marx added these other elements
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.860]   that made it far more powerful than the earlier versions
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.660]   that he decried as merely utopian socialism.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.540]   - So there's a million questions I could ask there,
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.140]   but so on the utopian side,
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.140]   so there is a utopian component
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.900]   to the way he tried to conceive of his ideas.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.740]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.300]   I mean, first of all, one has to stress,
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.020]   Marx would have gotten extremely upset
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.980]   at this point in the conversation
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.980]   because to call someone a utopian
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.540]   was precisely to argue that you're not scientific,
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.540]   you're not rational,
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.140]   you are not laying out the iron laws of history,
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.140]   you're merely hoping for the best,
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.420]   and that might be laudable,
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.020]   but it was fundamentally unrealistic.
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.300]   That said, hidden among Marx's insistence
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.420]   that there are laws and structures
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.860]   as history moves through class conflict,
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.820]   modes of production towards its ultimate goal
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.700]   of a comprehensive final revolution
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.700]   that will see all exploitation overthrown
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.660]   and people finally being freed from necessity,
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.060]   smuggled in among those things
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.500]   are most definitely utopian elements.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.700]   And there, they come especially at the end
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.700]   in which Marx sketches the notion
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.820]   of what things will look like
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.980]   after the revolution has resolved all problems.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.220]   There, vagueness sets in.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.180]   It's clear that it's a blessed state
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.100]   that's being talked about,
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.500]   people no longer exploiting one another,
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.700]   people no longer subject to necessity or poverty,
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.300]   but instead enjoying all of the productivity
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.460]   of industrialization that hitherto
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.220]   had been put to private profit,
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.460]   now collectively owned and deployed.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.220]   The notion that one will be able to work
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.860]   at one job in the morning
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.380]   and then engage in leisure activity
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.500]   or yet another fulfilling job in the afternoon,
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.780]   all of this free of any contradictions,
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.500]   free of necessity,
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.900]   free of the sort of ordinary irritations
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.460]   that we experience in our ordinary lives,
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.180]   that's deeply utopian.
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.780]   The difference was that Marx charted a route
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.300]   towards that outcome that presented itself
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.620]   as cutting edge science
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.660]   and moreover having the full credibility
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.140]   that science commanded so much,
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.500]   especially in the 19th and early 20th century.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.900]   - So there is a long journey from capitalism to communism
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.460]   that includes a lot of problems.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.660]   He thought once you resolve the problems,
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.740]   all the complexities of human interactions,
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.660]   the friction, the problems will be gone.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.060]   - To the extent that they were based on inequalities
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.580]   and on man's exploitation of man,
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.580]   the result was supposed to be a resolution of all of this.
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.340]   And inevitably, when you talk about the history of communism,
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.180]   you have to include the fact
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.340]   that this often tragic and dramatic history
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.140]   produced a lot of jokes.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.700]   Jokes that were in part reactions
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.540]   sometimes to the ideological claims
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.700]   made by people like Marx.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.820]   And one of the famous jokes was that,
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.980]   what's the difference between capitalism and communism?
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.300]   And the joke's answer was,
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.220]   capitalism is the exploitation of man by man
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.340]   and communism is the exact opposite.
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.860]   (laughing)
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.780]   - Yeah, you actually have a lecture on humor.
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.620]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.100]   And you deliver in such a dry, beautiful way.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.060]   Okay, there's again, a million questions.
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.180]   So you outline a set of contradictions,
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.300]   but it's interesting to talk about his view.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.940]   For example, what was Marx's view of history?
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.180]   - Marx had been a student of Hegel.
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.020]   And Hegel is a German idealist philosopher,
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:48.020]   had announced very definitively that history has a purpose.
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.500]   History is not a collection of random facts.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.180]   And as an idealist, he proposed that
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.940]   the true movement of history, the true meaning of history,
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.540]   what made history, history with a capital H,
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.900]   something that's transcendent and meaningful,
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.500]   was that it was the working out of an idea
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.380]   through different civilizations,
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.300]   different stages of historical development.
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.380]   And that idea was the idea of human freedom.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.380]   So it was not individuals or great thinkers alone
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.940]   making history and having an impact.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.580]   It was the idea itself, striving to come to fruition,
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.620]   striving to come to an evermore perfect realization.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.780]   In the case of Hegel,
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.740]   in this very Prussian and German context,
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.260]   he identified the realization of freedom
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.340]   also with the growth of the state,
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.060]   because he thought that governments
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.260]   are the ones that are going to be able to deliver on laws
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.620]   and on the ideal of a state of the rule of law,
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.220]   in German, the Rechtsstaat.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.220]   That was a noble dream.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.380]   At the same time, as we recognize from our perspective,
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.660]   state power has been put to all sorts of purposes
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.980]   besides guaranteeing the rule of law in our own times.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.980]   What Marx did was to take this characteristic insistence
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.860]   of Hegel that history is moving in a meaningful
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.620]   and discernible way towards the realization of an idea
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.540]   and flipped it on its head.
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.260]   Marx insisted that Hegel had so much
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.660]   that was right in his thinking,
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.460]   but what he had neglected to keep in mind
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.380]   was that in fact, history is based on matter.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.940]   So hence dialectical materialism,
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.820]   dialectical referring to things proceeding by clashes
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:39.420]   or conflict towards an ever greater realization
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.220]   of some essential idea.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.460]   And so Marx adapts a lot of ideas of Hegel.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.660]   You can recognize entire rhetorical maneuvers
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.860]   that are indebted to that earlier training,
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.220]   but now taken in a very different direction.
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.900]   What remained though was the confidence
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.460]   of being on the right side of history.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.560]   And there are few things that are as intoxicating
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.420]   as being convinced that your actions
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.460]   not only are right in the abstract,
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.180]   but are also destined to be successful.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.140]   - And also that you have the rigor of science
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.220]   backing you in your journey towards the truth.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.180]   - Absolutely.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:26.420]   So Engels, when he gives the great side eulogy
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.140]   for his beloved friend Marx,
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:34.220]   claims that Marx is essentially the Darwin of history,
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.060]   the Darwin of history.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.220]   That he had done for the world of politics
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.840]   and of human history,
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.260]   what Darwin had done with his theory of evolution,
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.060]   understanding the hidden mechanism,
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.260]   understanding the laws that are at work
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.020]   and that make that whole process meaningful
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.720]   rather than just one damn thing after another.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.020]   - What about the sort of famous line
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.980]   that history of all existing societies
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.900]   is the history of class struggles?
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.900]   So what about this conception of history
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.100]   as a history of class struggle?
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.620]   - Well, so this was the motive force
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.780]   that Karl Marx and Engels saw
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.820]   driving the historical process forward.
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.320]   And it's important to keep in mind
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.120]   that class conflict doesn't just mean
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.460]   revolutions, revolts, peasant uprisings.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.500]   It's sort of the totality of frictions
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.920]   and of clashes, conflicts of interest
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.660]   that appear in any society.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.080]   And so Marx was able in this spirit
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.840]   that he avowed was very scientific
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.420]   to demarcate stages of historical transformation.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.800]   Primitive communism in the prehistoric period,
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.680]   then moving towards what was called state slavery.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.840]   That's to say the early civilizations
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.220]   deploying human resources
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.760]   and ordering them by all powerful monarchs.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.180]   Then private slavery in the ancient period
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.920]   and then moving to feudalism in the middle ages.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.260]   And then here's where Marx is able to deliver
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.420]   a pronouncement about his own times,
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.000]   seeing that the present day is the penultimate,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.640]   the next to last stage of this historical development.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.140]   Because the feudal system of the middle ages
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.920]   and the dominance of the aristocracy has been overcome,
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.840]   has been displaced by the often heroic achievements,
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.300]   astonishing achievements in commerce
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.640]   and in world building of the middle class,
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.340]   the bourgeoisie, who have taken the world
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.180]   into their own hands and are engaged in class conflict
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.220]   with the class below them,
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.060]   which is the working class or the proletariat.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.680]   And so this sort of conflict also, by the way,
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.140]   obtains within classes.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.460]   So the bourgeoisie are going to be gravediggers,
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.380]   Marx announces, of their own supremacy
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.920]   because they're also competing against one another.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.780]   And members who don't survive that competition
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.860]   get pressed down into the subordinate working class,
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.300]   which grows and grows and grows to the point where
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:19.300]   at some future moment, the inevitable explosion will come
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:24.620]   and a swift revolution will overturn this last,
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.860]   this penultimate stage of human history
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.740]   and usher in instead the dictatorship of the working class.
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.240]   And then the abolition of all classes
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.400]   because with only one class remaining,
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.040]   everyone is finally unified
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.160]   and without those internal contradictions
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.640]   that had marked class conflict before.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.320]   - The dictatorship of the working class
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.920]   is an interesting term.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.680]   So what is the role of revolution in history?
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.680]   - So this in particular for Marx,
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.840]   I think is a really key moment,
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.200]   which is what makes that such a good question.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.040]   In his vision, the epic narrative
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.560]   that he's presenting to us,
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.260]   revolution is key.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.160]   It's not enough to have evolutionary change.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.340]   It's not a question of compromises.
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.980]   It's not a case of bargaining or balancing interests.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.100]   Revolution is necessary as part of the process
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.220]   of a subjugated class coming to awareness
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.420]   of its own historical role.
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.020]   And when we get to the proletariat,
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:27.660]   this working class in its entirety
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.580]   to whom Marx assigns this epic Promethean role
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.360]   of being the ones who are going to liberate all of humanity,
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.360]   a class that is universal in its interests
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.920]   and in the sort of role in salvation history
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.340]   that they'll be playing in this secular framework,
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:48.040]   they need revolution and the experience of revolution
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.680]   in order to come into their own.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.240]   Because without it, you'll only have half-hearted compromise
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.760]   and something less than the consciousness
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.920]   that they then need in order to rule, to administer,
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.860]   and to play the historical role that they're fated to have.
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.260]   - How did he conceive of a revolution,
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.380]   potentially a violent revolution,
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.860]   stabilizing itself into something
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.940]   where the working class was able to rule?
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.200]   - That's where things become a good deal less detailed
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.000]   in his and Engel's accounts.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.520]   The answer that they proposed in part was,
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.740]   this is for the future to determine.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.680]   So all of the details will be settled later.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.260]   I think that was allied to this
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:38.260]   was a tremendous confidence in some very 19th century ideas
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.540]   about how society could be administered
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.020]   and what made for orderly society
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:51.160]   in a way where if the right infrastructure was in place,
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.620]   you might expect society to kind of run itself
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.820]   without the need for micromanagement from above.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.100]   And hence, we arrive at Marx's tantalizing promise
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.400]   that there will be a period
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.780]   where it'll be necessary to have centralized control.
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.340]   And there might have to be, as he puts it,
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.900]   despotic inroads against property
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.580]   in order to bring this revolution to pass.
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.920]   But then afterwards, the state,
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.660]   because it represents everybody,
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.700]   rather than representing particular class interests
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.580]   that are in conflict with other classes,
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.700]   the state will eventually wither away.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.480]   So there won't be need for it.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.120]   Now, that's not to say that pure stasis arrives, right?
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.460]   Or that the stabilization equals being frozen in time.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.380]   It's not as if that is what things will look like.
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.780]   But instead, the big issues will be settled.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:46.060]   And henceforth, people will be able to enjoy lives of,
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.460]   as he would consider it, in authentic freedom
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.180]   without necessity, without poverty,
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.860]   as a result of this blessed state that's been arrived at.
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.180]   - Despotic inroads against property.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.580]   Did he elaborate on the despotic inroads?
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.460]   - Dispossession.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.220]   Dispossession of the middle classes and of the bourgeoisie.
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.860]   In his model, humanity is never standing still, right?
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.340]   So you'd probably argue in this dynamic vision
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.700]   of how history unfolds that there's always conflict
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.540]   and it's always moving, propelling history forward
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.480]   towards its predestined ending.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.100]   In the way he saw this climax,
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.420]   was that as things did not stay the same,
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.340]   the condition of the working class
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.860]   was constantly getting worse,
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.260]   and hence their revolutionary potential was growing.
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:45.100]   And at the same time, the expropriators, the bourgeoisie,
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.460]   were also facing diminishing returns
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.260]   as they competed against one another
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.760]   with more and more wealth
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.260]   concentrated in fewer and fewer hands
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.020]   and more and more elements
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.060]   of what had been the middle class
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.980]   detached from the ruling class
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.100]   and being pressed down into the working class.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.580]   For Marx, this is really a key part.
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.540]   I mean, it's a key part of this whole ratchet effect
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.580]   that's going to produce this final historical explosion.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.020]   And in German, the word given to that process
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.700]   was verelendung, which is very evocative.
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.100]   Elend means misery, so it's the growing misery.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.200]   When this gets translated into English,
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.860]   the results are never quite as evocative or satisfactory.
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.140]   The words that get used are immiserization or pauperization,
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.300]   meaning more and more people are being turned into paupers.
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.020]   But for Marx, that prediction is really key.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.500]   And even in his own lifetime,
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.240]   there were already hints that, in fact,
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.700]   if you looked sociologically
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.540]   at the really developed working classes
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.580]   in places like Great Britain or Germany,
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.460]   that process was not playing out as he had expected.
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.500]   In fact, although there have been enormous dislocations
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.940]   and tremendous suffering in the early chaotic,
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.380]   sort of Wild West stages of capitalism
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.380]   and of industrialization,
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.080]   there had been reform movements as well.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.660]   And there had been unions which had sought
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.340]   to carve out rules and agreements with employers
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.060]   for how the conditions
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.180]   under which workers labored might be ameliorated.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.380]   Moreover, the middle class,
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.900]   rather than dwindling and dwindling,
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.520]   seemed to actually be strengthening and growing in numbers
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.260]   or the appearance of new kinds of people
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.580]   like white-collar workers or technical experts.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.940]   So already in Marx's own lifetime,
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.580]   and then especially in what follows Marx's lifetime,
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.940]   this becomes a real problem
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.660]   because it puts a stick into the spokes
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.420]   of this particular historical prediction.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.700]   - Can you speak to this realm of ideas,
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.540]   which is fascinating,
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.860]   this battle of big ideas in the 19th century?
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.340]   What are the ideas that were swimming around here?
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.700]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:09.580]   Well, to describe the 19th century
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.260]   as sort of an age of ideologies is very apt
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.700]   because Europe is being racked
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:20.700]   and being put through the ringer of nationalism,
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.580]   demands for self-expression of peoples
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.280]   who earlier have been in empires or under monarchical rule,
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.280]   demands to redraw the map.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.320]   The tremendous transformations of the Industrial Revolution
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.580]   meant that in the course of about a generation,
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.860]   you would have seen the world around you change
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.940]   in ways that made it entirely unfamiliar.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.920]   You'd be able to travel across the landscape
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.920]   at speeds that had been unthinkable when you were a child.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.920]   So it's enormous change and demands for yet more change.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.860]   And so it's a great mix of ideas, ideologies,
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:02.460]   the old and the new, religious ideas, religious revivals,
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.780]   as well as demands for secularization.
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.780]   And stepping into all of this are Marx and Engels together
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:14.180]   in what has been called, I think with justice,
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.780]   one of the most important and influential
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:22.060]   intellectual partnerships of history.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.760]   They were very different men.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.800]   They were both German by origin.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.460]   Marx had trained as an academic.
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.520]   He had married the daughter of a baron.
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:39.060]   Because of his radical ideas, he had foreclosed
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.260]   or just found himself cut off
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.780]   from a possible academic career
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.420]   and went the route of radical journalism.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.860]   Engels was very different.
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.460]   Engels was the son of an industrialist
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:53.300]   and the family owned factories in Germany and in England.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.580]   So he was most definitely not a member of the proletariat
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.860]   that he and Marx were celebrating
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.460]   as so significant in their future historical role.
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.220]   There were also huge differences
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.260]   in character between these men.
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.540]   Marx, when people met him,
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.820]   they were astonished by his energy and his dynamism.
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.620]   They also saw him as a man who felt determined
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.940]   to dominate arguments.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.540]   He wanted to win arguments and was not one
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:24.320]   to settle for compromise or a middle road.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:30.180]   He was disorderly in his personal habits.
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.920]   We might mention, among other things,
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.820]   that he impregnated the family he made
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.140]   and didn't accept responsibility for the child.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:43.980]   He was also not inclined to undertake regular employment
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.980]   in order to support his growing family.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.500]   That's where Engels came in.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.820]   Engels, essentially, from his family fortune
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.620]   and then from his journalism afterwards,
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:59.180]   supported both himself and the Marx family for decades.
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.980]   And so in a sense, Engels made things happen.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:07.520]   In the mysterious way that friendships work,
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.320]   the very differences between these men
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.320]   made them formidable as a dynamic duo
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.360]   because they balanced off one another's idiosyncrasies
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.680]   and turned what might've been faults
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.280]   into potential strengths.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.880]   British historian A.J.P. Taylor
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.560]   always has a lovely turn of phrase,
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.400]   even when he's wrong about a historical issue.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.520]   In this case, he was right.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.620]   He said that Engels had charm and brilliance.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.380]   Marx was a genius.
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.980]   And Engels saw himself as definitely the junior partner
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.160]   in this relationship.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.720]   But here's the paradox.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.820]   Without Engels, pretty clearly,
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.680]   Marx would not have gone on to have
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.920]   the sort of lasting historical impact
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.780]   in the world of ideas that he had.
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.840]   - Just to throw in the mix,
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.560]   there's interesting characters swimming around.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.780]   So you have Darwin.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.120]   He has a, I mean, it's difficult to characterize
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.400]   the level of impact he had,
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.040]   even just in the religious context.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.020]   It challenges our conception of who we are as humans.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.080]   There's Nietzsche, who's also, I don't know,
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.840]   hanging around the area.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.840]   On the Russian side, there's Dostoevsky.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:22.520]   So it's interesting to ask maybe from your perspective,
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.400]   did these people interact in the space of ideas
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.080]   to where this is relevant to our discussion,
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.200]   or is this mostly isolated?
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.040]   - I think that it's a part of a great conversation, right?
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.940]   I think that in their works,
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.520]   they're reacting to one another.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.920]   I mean, Dostoevsky's thought
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.080]   ranges across the condition of modernity.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.140]   And he definitely has things to say about industrialization.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.660]   I think that they react to one another in these oblique ways,
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.880]   rather than always being at each other's throats
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.500]   in direct confrontations.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.920]   And that's what makes the 19th century
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.520]   so compelling as a story,
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.520]   just because of the sheer vitality of the arguments
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.960]   that are taking place in ways big and small.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.840]   - Well, we should say here,
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.980]   when you mentioned Karl Marx,
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.400]   maybe the color red comes up for people,
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.320]   and they think the Soviet Union, maybe China,
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.280]   but they don't think Germany, necessarily.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.000]   It's interesting that, I mean,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.760]   Germany is where communism was supposed to happen.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.800]   - That's right.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.360]   - And so can you maybe speak to that tension?
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.660]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.060]   I mean, this is definitely a factor
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.560]   in the entire history that we're referencing.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:46.920]   Marx and Engels never really shed their identity as Germans.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.920]   Many of their preconceptions,
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   even those traces of nationalism
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.680]   that they had within themselves,
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.520]   even as they were condemning nationalism
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.980]   as a fraud against the working class,
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:02.820]   clearly their entire formation had been affected
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.640]   by their German background.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.720]   And it's very true, as you point out,
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.200]   that Germany is intended to be the place
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.040]   where these predictions will play out,
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.480]   also in Britain, also in France,
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.040]   also eventually in the United States.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   But it's Germany, by virtue of being its central location,
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:28.480]   and then its rapid development later than Britain
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.240]   or France in industrialization,
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.880]   give it this special role in Marx's worldview.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.880]   And so it's a lasting irony,
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.040]   or a central irony of this whole story,
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.800]   that when a government establishes itself
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.040]   that claims to be following Marx's prescriptions
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.000]   and realizing his vision,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.800]   it happens in the wreckage of the Russian empire,
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.600]   a place that did not match the requirements
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.760]   of being industrialized, developed,
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.480]   well on its way in this historical process.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.600]   And nobody knew this better than the Bolsheviks.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.960]   Lenin and his colleagues had a keen sense
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.880]   that what they were doing, exciting as it was,
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.680]   was a gamble, it was a risk,
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.240]   because in fact, the revolution to really take hold
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.720]   had to seize power in Germany.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.160]   And that's why immediately after taking power,
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.920]   they're not sure they're going to last.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.600]   Their hope, their promise of salvation
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.720]   is that a workers' revolution will erupt in Germany,
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.240]   defeated Germany, in order to link up
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.160]   with the one that has been launched
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.560]   in this unlikely Russian location,
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.920]   and henceforth, great things will follow
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.520]   that do hew to Marx's historical vision.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.080]   The last thing to mention about this
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.760]   is that this predominance of Germany
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:03.760]   in the thinking of Marx had two other reflections.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:09.320]   One was that German socialists and later communists
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.000]   organize in order to fulfill Marx's vision,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.560]   and they produce something that leaves other Westerners
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.040]   in awe in the late 19th century,
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.720]   and that's the building of a strong German workers' movement
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.360]   and a social democratic party.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.480]   That social democratic party, by 1912,
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.640]   is the largest party in German politics by vote,
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.520]   and there's the possibility they might even come to power
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.320]   without needing radical revolution,
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.360]   which, again, also goes against Marx's original vision
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.480]   of the necessity for a revolution.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:52.520]   Workers around the world, or rather radical socialists,
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.760]   look with admiration and awe
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.720]   at what the Germans have achieved,
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.400]   and they see themselves as trying to do
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.360]   what the Germans have done.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:04.040]   The final point is, growing up during the Cold War,
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.800]   one thought that, well, if you want to represent somebody
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.960]   as being a communist,
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.920]   that person has to have a Russian accent,
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.240]   because Russia, after all,
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.560]   the homeland of this form of government, the Soviet Union,
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.040]   that must be the point of origin.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.640]   Before the Bolsheviks seized power,
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.720]   in order to really be a serious radical socialist,
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.200]   you needed to read German,
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.760]   because you needed to read Marx,
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.280]   and you needed to read Kautsky,
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.160]   and you needed to read Bernstein
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.440]   and other thinkers in this tradition,
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.520]   and it's only after the Soviet seizure of power
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.080]   that this all changes.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.400]   So there's lots of marks of that phenomenon.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.280]   - Which is why the clash between nationalism and communism
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:51.960]   in Germany is such a fascinating aspect of history
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.760]   and all the different trajectories it could take,
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.320]   and we'll talk about it.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.920]   But if we return to the 19th century,
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.480]   you've said that Marx's chief rival
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.360]   was Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin,
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.520]   who famously said in 1942,
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.160]   quote, "The passion for destruction
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.480]   "is also a creative passion."
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.440]   So what kind of future did Bakunin envision?
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.280]   - Well, Bakunin, in some things, agreed with Marx,
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.280]   and in many others, disagreed.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.400]   He was an anarchist,
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.800]   rather than abhewing to the sort of scheme of history
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.480]   that Marx was proposing.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.640]   So he did see humanity as fighting a struggle
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.680]   for a better way of life.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.160]   He envisioned, as your quote suggests,
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.520]   that revolution and sheer confrontation
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.680]   and overthrow of the existing state of things,
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.560]   not compromise, was going to be the way to get there.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.520]   But his vision was very different.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:53.520]   Rather than organizing conspiratorial
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.080]   and hierarchical political movement,
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:02.080]   Bakunin envisioned that the ties would be far looser,
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.160]   that both the revolutionary movement
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.520]   and the future state of humanity
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.720]   would grow out of the free association,
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.800]   the anarchist thinking,
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.440]   the free association of individuals
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.600]   who rejected hierarchical thinking
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.600]   in their relations with one another,
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.200]   rejected the state as a form of organized violence,
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.800]   and rejected traditional religious ideas
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.040]   that he saw as buttressing hierarchies.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.920]   So Bakunin is part of a broader movement
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.960]   of socialists and anarchists who were demanding change
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.920]   and envisioning really fundamental transformation,
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.920]   but his particular anarchist vision
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.320]   steers him into conflict with Marx.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.520]   And he makes some prophetic remarks
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:47.520]   about the problems with the system that Marx is proposing.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.880]   You should add to this,
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.520]   that the very fact that Marx is a German by background
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.280]   and Bakunin is Russian kind of adds a further nationalist
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.800]   or element of ethnic difference there.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:03.160]   Bakunin warned that a sort of creeping
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.920]   German authoritarianism might insinuate its way
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:12.480]   into a movement that hewed too closely to having hierarchies
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.240]   in the struggle to overthrow hierarchies.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:20.240]   And his anarchist convictions are not in question here.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.200]   They led him into conflict with Marx
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.160]   and Marx railed against him, denounced him,
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:31.880]   and eventually had him expelled from the international.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.120]   One of the things though,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.160]   that also makes Bakunin so significant is,
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   Bakunin is the first in a longer series of approaches
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.360]   between anarchists and communists,
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.000]   where they try to make common cause.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.040]   And you have to say that in every case,
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.440]   it ends badly for the anarchists,
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.020]   because the communist vision in particular,
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.120]   especially in its Leninist version,
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.480]   argued for discipline
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.520]   and a tightly organized professional revolutionary movement.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.480]   The anarchists who sought to make common cause
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.080]   with communists,
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.800]   whether it was in the days of the Russian revolution
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.720]   or the Russian civil war,
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:21.200]   or whether it was then in the Spanish civil war,
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.640]   the anarchists found themselves targeted
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:29.640]   by the communists precisely because of their skepticism
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.700]   about what turned out to be an absolutely key element
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.940]   in the Leninist prescription for a successful revolution.
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.100]   - If we can take that tangent a little bit.
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:43.540]   So I guess anarchists were less organized.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.620]   - Yeah, that's my definition.
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:45.460]   - Yeah.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:49.380]   Why do you think anarchism hasn't been rigorously tried
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:54.100]   in the way that communism was?
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.500]   If we just take a complete sort of tangent,
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:01.500]   I mean, in one sense, we are living in anarchy today
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:06.540]   because the nations are in an anarchic state
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.860]   with each other.
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.900]   But why do you think sort of there's not been
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.660]   an anarchist revolution?
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.020]   - Well, I think that probably some anarchists
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.020]   would beg to differ, right?
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:19.500]   They would see communes in Spain
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.460]   during the Spanish civil war as an example
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.140]   of trying to put anarchist ideas into place.
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:29.340]   Bakunin flitted from one area of unrest to another,
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.740]   hoping to be in on finally the founding
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.500]   of the sort of free communes that he had in mind.
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.300]   Another key point in all of this
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.420]   is that anarchy means something different
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.580]   to different people as a term.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.980]   And so when you point out quite correctly
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.140]   that we have an anarchic international situation,
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.580]   that's kind of the Hobbesian model
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:54.300]   of the war of all against all, where man is a wolf to man.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.300]   Generally, except if you're talking about nihilists
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.820]   in the Russian revolutionary tradition,
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:05.140]   anarchists see anarchy as a blessed state
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.900]   and one where finally people will be freed
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:12.100]   from the distorting influence of hierarchies,
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:16.300]   traditional beliefs, subjugation, inequalities.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.540]   So for them, anarchy, growing out of the liberation
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:24.740]   of the human being is seen as a positive good and peaceful.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.700]   Now that's at odds with the prescription
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.140]   of someone like Bakunin for how to get there.
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:35.140]   He sees overthrow as being necessary on the route to that.
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:40.740]   But as we point out, it's absolutely key
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.060]   to this entire dynamic that to be an anarchist
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.700]   means that your efforts are not gonna be organized
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.220]   the way a disciplined
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.540]   and tightly organized revolutionary movement would be.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.700]   - Yeah, it's an interesting stretch
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.340]   that a violent revolution will take us to a place
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.420]   of no violence or very little violence.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.900]   So it's a leap.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.380]   - It's a leap.
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:05.180]   And it kind of, it points to a phenomenon
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.180]   that would have enraged Marx
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.480]   and would have been deeply alienating
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.860]   to others in the tradition who followed him,
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.340]   but that so many scholars have commented on.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.180]   And that's that there is a religious element,
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:23.140]   not a avowed one, but a kind of hidden religious
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:27.440]   or secular religious element to Marx's vision,
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.500]   to the tradition that follows Marx.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.420]   And just think of the correspondences, right?
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.540]   Marx himself as kind of a,
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.960]   positioning himself as a savior figure,
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.960]   whether that's a Prometheus or a Moses
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.260]   who will lead people to the promised land.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:48.260]   The apocalypse or the end times is this final revolution
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.900]   that will usher in a blessed final state, a utopia,
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:57.900]   which is equivalent to a secular version of heaven.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:02.900]   There's the working class playing the role of humanity
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.160]   in its struggle to be redeemed.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.120]   And scholar after scholar has pointed this out.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.860]   Reinhold Niebuhr back in the 1930s
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.100]   had an article in "The Atlantic" magazine
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.380]   that talked about the Soviet Union's communism
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.060]   as a religion.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:25.420]   Erich Voegelin, a German-American scholar
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.700]   who fled the Nazis and relocated
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:33.140]   to Louisiana State University and wrote tomes
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.660]   about the new phenomenon of political religions
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:37.740]   in the modern period.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:41.300]   And he saw fascism and Nazism
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:46.300]   and Soviet communism as bearing the stamp
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.700]   of political religions,
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:54.700]   meaning ideologies that promised what an earlier age
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.860]   would have understood in religious terms.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.380]   Voegelin called this the eschaton
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.260]   and said that these end times,
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.460]   the eschaton was being promised in the here and now,
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.980]   being made imminent.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.380]   And he warned against that,
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.780]   saying the results are likely to be disastrous.
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.900]   - So that's actually a disagreement with this idea
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:20.900]   that people sometimes say that the Soviet Union
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:24.900]   is an example of an atheistic society.
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.780]   So when you have atheism as the primary thing
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.620]   that underpins the society, this is what you get.
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.740]   So that's what you're saying is a kind of rejection
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:37.760]   of that, saying that there's a strong religious component
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.020]   to communism.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:42.500]   - A hidden component, one that's not officially recognized.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.820]   I mean, I think that, you know,
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.220]   I had a chance to witness this actually.
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.620]   When I was a child, my family,
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.620]   I grew up in Chicago to a Lithuanian American family.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.580]   And my father, who was a mathematician,
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:00.420]   got a very rare invitation to travel to Soviet Lithuania,
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.580]   to the University of Vilnius to meet with colleagues.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.880]   And at this point, journeys of more than a few days
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:12.600]   or a week were very rare to the Soviet Union for Americans.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:17.100]   And the result was that I had unforgettable experiences
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:20.720]   visiting the Soviet Union in Brezhnev's day.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.380]   And among the things I saw there was a museum of atheism
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.040]   that had been established in a church
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.520]   that had been ripped apart from inside
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:34.520]   and was meant to kind of embody
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.860]   the official stance of atheism.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:41.700]   And I remember being baffled by the museum on the inside
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.860]   because you would expect exhibits.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.820]   You would expect something dramatic,
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.500]   something that will be compelling.
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.660]   And instead, there was some folk art from the countryside
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.660]   showing bygone beliefs.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:57.180]   There were some lithographs or engravings
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:00.500]   of the Spanish Inquisition and its horrors.
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.560]   And that was pretty much it.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.560]   But as a child, I remember being reproved in that museum
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.860]   for not wearing my windbreaker,
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.020]   but instead carrying it on my arm,
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.300]   which was a very disrespectful thing to do
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.520]   in an official museum of atheism.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.620]   When I was able to visit the Soviet Union later
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.820]   for a language course in the summer of 1989,
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:26.980]   one of the obligatory tours that we took
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:31.380]   was to file reverently past the body of Lenin
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.660]   outside the Kremlin in a mausoleum at Red Square.
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:38.980]   And communist mummies like those of Lenin,
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.140]   earlier Stalin had been there as well,
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.600]   communist mummies like Mao or Ho Chi Minh,
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.140]   really, I think, speak to a blending
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:53.340]   of earlier religious sensibility,
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:56.180]   reverence for relics of great figures,
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.640]   almost saintly figures,
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:01.700]   so that even what got proclaimed as atheism
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.940]   turned out to be a very demanding faith as well.
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:05.300]   And I think that's a contradiction
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.040]   that other scholars have pointed out as well.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.620]   - Yeah, it's a very complicated sort of discussion
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:15.540]   when you remove religion as a big component of a society,
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:19.740]   whether something like a framing of political ideologies
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:23.500]   in religious ways is the natural consequence of that.
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.260]   - We hear nature abhorring a vacuum,
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:29.140]   and I think that there are places in human character
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:31.900]   that long for transcendental explanations, right?
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.580]   That it's not all meaningless.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.180]   In fact, there's a larger purpose.
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.600]   And I think it's not a coincidence
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.980]   that such a significant part of resistance
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:46.500]   to communist regimes has in part come from,
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.220]   on the one hand, religious believers,
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.380]   and on the other hand,
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:54.500]   from disillusioned true believers in communism
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:59.500]   who find themselves undergoing an internal experience
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.220]   of just a revulsion,
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:05.660]   finding that their ideals have not been followed through on.
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.140]   - So this topic is one of several topics
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.000]   that you eloquently describe as contradictions
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.500]   within the ideas of Marx.
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:17.700]   So religious, there is a kind of religious adherence
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:21.740]   versus also the rejection of religious dogma
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.340]   that he stood for.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:25.140]   We've talked about some of the others,
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:28.860]   the tension between nationalism that emerged
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:29.800]   when it was implemented
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:33.220]   versus what communism is supposed to be, which is global,
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:34.280]   so globalism.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:38.620]   Then there's the thing that we started talking with
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.380]   is individualism.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.580]   So history is supposed to be defined
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.140]   by the large collection of humans,
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.820]   but there does seem to be these singular figures,
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.980]   including Marx himself, that are really important.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.400]   Geography of global versus restricted to certain countries
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.600]   and tradition,
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:02.640]   you're supposed to break with the past and communism,
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.680]   but then Marxism became one of the strongest traditions
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.600]   in history.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.480]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.240]   I think that that last one is especially significant
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.400]   because it's deeply paradoxical.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.720]   I mean, trying to outline these contradictions, by the way,
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.440]   is like subjecting Marx to the sort of analysis
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.960]   that Marx subjected other people to,
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.080]   which is to point out internal contradictions,
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.320]   things that are likely to become pressure points
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.640]   or cracks that might open up in what's supposed to be
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:33.640]   a completely set and durable and effective framework.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:37.600]   The one about tradition,
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:42.440]   Marx points out that the need for revolution
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.560]   is in order to break with the traditions
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.680]   that have hemmed people in,
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.820]   this earlier ways of thinking, earlier social structures,
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.120]   and to constantly renovate.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.080]   And what happens instead is
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.540]   a tradition of radical rupture emerges.
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:02.280]   And that's really tough because imagine
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.720]   the last stages of the Soviet Union,
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:10.720]   where keen observers can tell
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.600]   that there are problems that are building in society.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.480]   There are discontents and demands that are going to clash,
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.560]   especially when someone like Gorbachev
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.480]   is proposing reforms and things are suddenly thrown open
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.500]   for discussion.
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:28.280]   The very notion that you have the celebration
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:33.240]   of revolutionaries and the Bolshevik legacy
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:38.240]   at a time when the state wants to enforce stability
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:42.680]   and an order that's been received from the prior generation.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.240]   Think of Brezhnev's time, for instance.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.000]   All of that is especially volatile mix
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.240]   and unlikely to work out very durably in the long run.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.240]   - I would love to sort of talk about the works of Marx,
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.540]   the "Communist Manifesto" and "Das Kapital."
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:01.720]   What can we say that's interesting
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:05.560]   about the manifestation of his ideas on paper?
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.200]   - Well, the first thing to note, obviously,
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.600]   is that those two works are very different.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.920]   "Das Kapital" is an enormous multi-volume work
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.880]   that Marx worked at and only got the first volume out
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.280]   because Engels begged him to stop revising.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.400]   Please just finally get it into press.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.440]   And then the rest, Engels had to actually reconstruct
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:28.840]   out of notes after Marx passed away.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.720]   It's a huge work.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:34.720]   By contrast, the "Communist Manifesto" is a brief pamphlet
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.800]   that ended up affecting the lives
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.000]   of many millions worldwide,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.300]   in spite of its comparative brevity.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:47.080]   The "Communist Manifesto," moreover,
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.760]   is also something of the nature
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.480]   of having a delayed fuse, you could say,
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.480]   because when it first appears amid the revolutions of 1848
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.720]   that sweep across Europe,
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.640]   the work is contrary to what people often believe.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.880]   That pamphlet did not cause the revolutions of 1848,
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.560]   many of which had national or liberal demands.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:15.000]   The voice of Marx and Engels was barely to be heard
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.280]   over the din of other far more prominent actors.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.920]   It is, however, in the aftermath
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.040]   that this work takes on tremendous significance
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.360]   and becomes popularly read and popularly distributed.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:33.360]   It's especially the bloody episode
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.500]   of the Paris Commune in 1871,
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.120]   which comes to be identified with Marx,
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:42.420]   even though it was not purely inspired by Marx alone,
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.960]   nor were all of the communards devoted Marxists.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.400]   It's the identification of this famous
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.520]   or infamous episode in urban upheaval
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:56.520]   that really leads to worldwide notoriety for Marx
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.080]   and attention to those works.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.840]   And they're very different in form.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.480]   Das Kapital is intended to be the origin of species
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.600]   of its realm of economic thought.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:12.640]   And represents years and years of work of Marx
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.400]   laboring in the British Museum Library,
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.920]   working through statistics,
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:22.400]   working on little bits and pieces of a larger answer
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.960]   to big historical questions
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.000]   that he believes that he's arrived at.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.440]   Its tone is different from that of the Communist Manifesto,
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.480]   which is a call to arms.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.680]   It announces with great confidence
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.160]   what the scheme of history will be,
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:41.560]   but rather than urging that the answer might be passivity
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.320]   and just waiting for history to play out
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.600]   in its preordained way,
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:49.600]   it's also a clarion call to make the revolution happen
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:54.400]   and is intended to be a pragmatic, practical statement
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.200]   of how this is to play out.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.160]   And it starts in part with those ringing words
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.600]   about a ghost or a specter haunting Europe,
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.080]   the specter of communism, which wasn't true at the time,
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:10.680]   but decades later, most definitely is the case.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.520]   - Is there something you could say
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:14.520]   about the difference between Marxian economics
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.120]   and Marxist political ideology?
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.680]   So the political side of things
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:24.000]   and the economics side of things.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.240]   - So I think that Marx would probably have responded
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.120]   that in fact, those things are indivisible.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:37.880]   The analysis as sort of purely theoretical
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:43.000]   certainly can be performed on any economic reality
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.520]   that you care to mention,
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:49.520]   but the imperatives that grow out of that economic analysis
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.840]   are political.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:56.720]   Marx and Engels emphasize the unity of theory and practice.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:01.640]   So it's not enough to dispassionately analyze,
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.480]   it's a call to action as well,
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.800]   because if you've delivered the answer
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:10.320]   to how history evolves and changes, it obligates you, right?
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.720]   It demands certain action.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.760]   You sometimes hear from undergraduates
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:20.440]   that they've heard from their high school history teachers
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:24.720]   that Marxism was just a theoretical construct
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:28.200]   that was in the idle production of a philosopher
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.400]   who was not connected to the world
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.240]   and was never meant to be tried in practice.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.840]   Marx would have been furious to hear this,
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.880]   and it's almost heroically wrong as a historical statement,
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:44.280]   because Marx insisted that all previous philosophers
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.760]   have theorized about reality.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.800]   What now is really necessary is to change it.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   So you could say that in the abstract,
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.920]   a Marxist economist can certainly use
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.800]   Marx's theoretical framework
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:06.280]   to compare to a given economic reality,
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:08.560]   but Marx would have seen that as incomplete
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.960]   and as deeply unsatisfactory.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.760]   There's kind of a footnote to all of this,
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:17.760]   which is that even though Marxist dialectical materialism
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.400]   grounds itself in these economic realities
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.880]   and the political prescription is supposed to flow
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.440]   from the economic realities
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:29.440]   and be inevitably growing out of them,
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:34.800]   in the real history of communist regimes,
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.080]   you've actually seen periods where the economics
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.640]   becomes detached from the politics.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:44.640]   And I'm thinking in particular of the new economic period
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.720]   early in the history of the Soviet Union,
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:50.560]   when Lenin realizes that the economy is so far gone
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:53.880]   that you need to reintroduce or allow in a limited way
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.360]   some elements of private enterprise
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:59.400]   just to start getting Russia back on course
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:02.760]   in order to have the accumulation of surplus
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.960]   that will be necessary to build the project at all.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.000]   And there are many Bolsheviks
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   who see the new economic policy as a terrible compromise
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.360]   and a betrayal of their ideas,
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:19.320]   but it's seen as necessary for a short while
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:22.720]   and then Stalin will wreck it entirely.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:26.320]   Or consider for that matter, China today,
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.520]   where you have a dominant political class,
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:32.000]   the Communist Party of China,
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.320]   which is allowing economic development
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.280]   and private enterprise
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:40.480]   as long as it retains political control.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:45.480]   So some of these elements already represent divergences
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.240]   from what Marx would have expected.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:52.680]   And this points to a really key problem or question
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.240]   for all of the history of communism.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.880]   It has to do with it being a tradition in spite of itself.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.520]   And that could be expressed in the following way.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.520]   An original set of ideas is going to evolve.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.720]   It's going to change because circumstances change.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.000]   What elaborations of any doctrine,
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.360]   whether it's communism or a religious doctrine
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.120]   or any political ideology,
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:20.120]   what elaborations are natural stages in the evolution
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:24.080]   of any living set of ideas?
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:29.080]   Or when you reach the point where some shift
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.320]   or some adaptation is so radically different
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.920]   that it actually breaks with the tradition.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.760]   And that's an insoluble problem.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.560]   You probably have to take it on a case by case basis.
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.480]   It speaks to issues like the question
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.960]   that gets raised today.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:49.840]   Is China in a meaningful sense a communist country anymore?
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.640]   And there's a diversity of opinion on this score.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.360]   Or if you're looking at the history of communism
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:00.360]   and you look at North Korea,
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.080]   which now is on its third installment
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.920]   of a dynastic leader from the same family
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.420]   who ruled like a god king over a regime
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.860]   that calls itself communist.
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:14.680]   Is that still a form of communism?
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.440]   Is it an evolution of?
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:19.100]   Is it a complete reversal of?
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:23.880]   I tend to want to take an anthropological perspective
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.200]   in the history of communism
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:29.860]   and to take very seriously those people who avow
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:31.280]   that they are communists.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.520]   And this is the project that they have underway.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.440]   And then after hearing that avowal,
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.360]   I think as a historian, you have to say,
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:40.040]   well, let's look at the details.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.020]   Let's see what changes have been made,
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.020]   what continuities might still exist,
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:46.740]   whether there's a larger pattern to be discerned here.
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.820]   So it's a very, very complicated history
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.500]   that we're talking about.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.100]   - Let's step back to the end of the 19th century
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:56.300]   and the beginning of the 20th century.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:00.500]   And let's steel man the case for communism.
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.960]   Let's put ourselves in the shoes of the people there.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.400]   Not in this way we can look back
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.300]   at what happened in the 20th century.
[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:11.800]   Why was this such a compelling notion
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.780]   for millions of people?
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:16.040]   Can we make the case for it?
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.640]   - Well, clearly it was a compelling case
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:18.600]   for millions of people.
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.200]   And part of this story has to do with,
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.700]   overall has to do with the faith,
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:28.480]   conviction, stories of people sacrificing themselves
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.600]   as well as their countrymen
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:34.300]   in a cause that they believed was not just legitimate,
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:37.520]   but demanded their total obedience.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:41.400]   I think that throughout the early part of the 20th century,
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:44.600]   the late 19th century, early part of the 20th century,
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:48.720]   so much of the compelling case for communism
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:53.040]   came from the confidence that people in the West
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.640]   more generally placed in science.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:00.500]   The notion that science is answering problems.
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.720]   Science is giving us solutions
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.860]   to how the world around us works,
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.920]   how the world around us can be improved.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.640]   Some varieties of that,
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:10.800]   and I watch the quotation marks,
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.840]   science were crazy, right?
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.240]   Like phrenology, so-called scientific racism
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:21.000]   that tried to divide humanity up into discrete blocks
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.740]   and to manipulate them in ways
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.980]   that were allegedly scientific or rational.
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.920]   So there were horrors that followed
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.920]   from those invocations of science,
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:32.480]   but its prestige was enormous.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:37.480]   And that in part had to do with the lessening grip
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:41.760]   of religious ideas on intellectual elites.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:44.660]   More generally, processes of secularization,
[00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:46.080]   not total secularization,
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.600]   but processes of secularization
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.200]   in Western industrial societies.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.560]   And the sense that here's a doctrine
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:57:00.160]   that will allow escape from wars,
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.720]   brought on by capitalist competition,
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:08.360]   poverty and economic cycles and depressions
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:11.640]   brought on by a capitalist competition,
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:14.600]   the inequalities of societies
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:18.000]   that remain hierarchical and class-based.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   And this claim to being cutting edge science,
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   I think allows people like Lenin
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.160]   to derive immense confidence
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.640]   in the prescription that they have for the future.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:36.120]   And that paradoxically, the confidence
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:38.160]   that you have in broad strokes,
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.680]   the right set of answers for how to get to the future,
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:45.020]   also allows you to take huge liberties
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:49.160]   with the tactics and the strategies that you follow
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:51.280]   as long as your ultimate goal
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:56.200]   remains the one sketched by this master plan.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.640]   So ultimately, some of the predictions
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:00.800]   of someone like Lenin,
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:05.800]   that once society has reached that stage
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.120]   of the dictatorship of the proletariat,
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:12.000]   the notion that governments
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.720]   will essentially be able to run themselves.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.800]   And the model he had in mind, oddly enough,
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.200]   was Swiss post offices.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.920]   Being in Swiss exile must have impressed him so much
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:26.420]   with the orderliness and the sheer discipline
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:28.920]   and rationality of a Swiss post office.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:33.000]   And he thought, why can't you organize governments like this
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.080]   where you don't need political leaders,
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:38.920]   you don't need grand visions, you have procedures,
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:42.560]   you have bureaucracy, which does its job
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:44.240]   in a way that's not alienating,
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:46.960]   but simply produces the greatest good.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:50.600]   When you think of the experiences
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:53.080]   with the bureaucracy in the 20th century,
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.560]   one's hair stands on end.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:59.280]   To have the comparative naivete on display
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.880]   with a prediction like that,
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.680]   but it derives from that confidence
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:06.360]   that it's all gonna be okay because we understand,
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.720]   we have the key, we have the plan
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:13.720]   to how to arrive at this final configuration of humanity.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:18.120]   - Yeah, the certainty of science, in quotes,
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:21.760]   and the goal of utopia gets you in trouble.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.640]   But also just on the human level
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:28.280]   from a working class person perspective.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.480]   From the Industrial Revolution,
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:33.680]   you see the growing inequality, wealth inequality.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:36.400]   And there is a kind of, you see people getting wealthy
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:40.320]   and combined with the fact that life is difficult,
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.240]   life in general, life is suffering for many,
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:46.320]   for most, for all, if you listen to some philosophers.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:50.840]   And there is kind of a powerful idea
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:53.720]   in that the man is exploiting me.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.560]   And that's a populous message
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.240]   that a lot of people resonate with
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.800]   because to a degree it's true in every system.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.240]   And so before you kind of know
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:09.240]   how these economic and political ideas manifest themselves,
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.000]   it is really powerful to say here beyond the horizon,
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.040]   there's a world where the rich man
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.440]   will not exploit my hard work anymore.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.880]   And I think that's a really powerful idea.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.720]   - It is.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:24.800]   I mean, at the same time though,
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.520]   it kind of points to a further problem
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.560]   and that's the identity of the revolutionaries.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.040]   It turned out that many of these revolutionary movements
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.320]   and then the founding elites of communist countries
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.760]   in the aftermath of the Soviet seizure of power
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.320]   turned out to be something quite different
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.720]   from people who have spent their lives in factories
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.320]   experiencing the Industrial Revolution firsthand.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.760]   I mean, there's a special role here for intellectuals.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.480]   And when Marx and Engels
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.800]   write into "The Communist Manifesto,"
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.520]   the notion that certain exceptional individuals
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.640]   can rise above their class origins
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.640]   in a way other people can't
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.400]   and transcend their earlier role,
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.640]   their materially determined role
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.760]   in order to gain a perspective
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.600]   on the historical process as a whole
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.760]   and ally themselves with a working class
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.480]   in its struggle for communism,
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.160]   this sort of special role
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.240]   that they carved out for themselves
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.520]   is enormously appealing for intellectuals
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.080]   'cause any celebration of intellectuals as world movers
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.520]   is gonna appeal to intellectuals.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:38.520]   That gap, that frequent reality
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:43.760]   of not being in touch with the very classes
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.480]   that the communists are aiming to represent
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:52.160]   is a very frequent theme in this story.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:58.000]   It also speaks to a crucial part of this story,
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.320]   which is the breaking apart or the civil war,
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.520]   the war of brother against brother,
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.040]   the fraternal struggle that splits socialism
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.400]   and splits followers of Marx.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.840]   And that's in the aftermath of the First World War
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:19.280]   in particular, or during this traumatic experience,
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.960]   the way in which Lenin encourages the foundation
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.040]   of radical parties that will break with social democracy
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.480]   of the sort that had been elaborated,
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.160]   especially in places like Germany,
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.720]   scorning their moderation
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.960]   and instead announcing a new dispensation,
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.040]   which was the Leninist conception
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:41.800]   of a disciplined, hardcore professional revolutionaries
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.400]   who will act in ways
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.120]   that a mere trade union movement couldn't.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.080]   And what this speaks to is a fundamental tension
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.640]   in radical movements
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:57.640]   because left to their own devices, Lenin announces,
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:02.560]   workers tend to focus on their reality,
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.240]   their families, their workplace,
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.320]   want better working conditions, unionize,
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:12.280]   and then aim to negotiate with employers
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:16.320]   or to agitate for reforms on the part of the state
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.800]   to improve their living conditions.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:22.280]   And then they're happy for the advances that they have won.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.040]   And for Lenin, that's not enough
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.520]   because that's a half measure.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.120]   That's the sort of thing that leads you
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.520]   into an accommodation with the system
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.760]   rather than the overthrow of the system.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.960]   So there's a real,
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:35.960]   there's a constant tension in this regard
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.480]   that plays itself out over the long haul.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.120]   - So let's go to Lenin and the Russian revolution.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:48.120]   How did communism come to power in the Soviet Union?
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.960]   - It came to power as a result of stepping
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.640]   into a power vacuum.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.600]   And the power vacuum was created by the first world war.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.840]   And it's the effect that it had as a total war,
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.120]   unprecedented pressure placed on a regime
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.160]   that in many ways was a traditional almost feudal monarchy,
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.520]   only experiencing the beginnings of the modernization
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.840]   that the rest of Europe had undergone.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:18.000]   And for this reason, communism comes to power
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.160]   in a place that Marx probably wouldn't have expected
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.720]   in the wreckage of the Russian empire.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:28.720]   Lenin is absolutely vital to this equation
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:32.760]   because he's the one who presses the process forward.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:37.760]   Ironically, given the claim of communist leaders
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:41.880]   to having the key to history,
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.440]   just a few months previous in exile in Switzerland,
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.040]   Lenin had been despairing and had been convinced
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:53.040]   that he may not even live to see the advent of that day.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.000]   But then when revolution does break out
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   in the Russian empire in February of 1917,
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.600]   Lenin is absolutely frantic to get back.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.120]   And when he does get back as a result of a deal
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:12.000]   that is negotiated with the German high command,
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.560]   a step that they'll later live very much to regret,
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.440]   he is able to get back and to go into action
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:22.640]   and to press for nothing less than the seizure of power
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.720]   that brings his Bolshevik faction,
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:30.080]   the radical wing of the socialist movement,
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.760]   to power and then to build the Soviet Union.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.880]   - So even he was surprised how effective
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:39.120]   and how fast the revolution happened.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:42.640]   - He was, although I think that he would have agreed
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.960]   that what was necessary was a cataclysm
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.920]   on the scale of the First World War to make this happen.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:55.160]   The First World War shatters so many
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.840]   of the certainties of the 19th century
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.920]   that we talked about as a dynamic period
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.680]   with argument between ideologies.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:06.680]   It scrambles all sorts of earlier debates.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:11.680]   It renegotiates the status of the individual
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:15.200]   versus an all-powerful state and the claims of the state
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.680]   because to win or even just to survive in World War I,
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.840]   you need to centralize, centralize, centralize,
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:28.080]   and to put everything onto a authoritarian wartime footing
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.240]   in country after country.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.920]   So Lenin earlier had already articulated
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.760]   the possibility that this might happen
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:40.760]   by talking about how the entire globe already was connected
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:47.800]   and there's a chain of capitalist development
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.560]   that is connecting different countries
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.320]   so that the weakest link in the chain,
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:56.560]   if it breaks, if it pops open,
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:01.560]   it might actually inaugurate much bigger processes
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.080]   and start a chain reaction.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.880]   And that's what he intended to do
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:10.680]   and has the chance to do in the course of 1917.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:15.480]   Incidentally, just to get a sense of the sheer chaos
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:20.480]   and the human, on an individual human level,
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:25.560]   what the absence of established authority meant,
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:29.040]   there's few works of literature that are as powerful
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:32.320]   as Boris Pasternak's "Dr. Zhivago"
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:36.440]   for giving the whole sweep of contending forces
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.160]   in a power vacuum.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:41.240]   It's an amazing testimony to that time and place.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.000]   - So you said that Bolsheviks saw violence
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.120]   and terror as necessary.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:49.840]   So can you just speak to this aspect of there?
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.420]   Because they took power.
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:55.020]   And so this was a part of the way they saw the world.
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:57.120]   - Right, and it had antecedents.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:02.040]   Even though Lenin and his colleagues
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.960]   are competing amongst each other
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.440]   for the title of most faithful disciple of Marx
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:12.440]   and most true to the received theory in practice,
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.880]   there's other influences, earlier influences
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:18.600]   that operate in the Russian context
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:23.000]   that were not operative, let's say, on the German context.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.680]   And here you have to step back
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.240]   and think about the nature of Tsarism,
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.680]   which had maintained still into the 20th century
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.880]   the notion of a divine right to rule,
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.840]   that God had ordained the Tsarist system
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.920]   and its hierarchies,
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.480]   and that to question these was sinful
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:43.840]   and politically not advisable.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:48.520]   And the restrictive nature of Russian society at this point
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.680]   dominated by the Tsarist establishment.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.760]   Its harshness, its reactionary nature
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:57.240]   meant that people who in another context,
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.320]   in another country, might have been reformers
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.320]   could instead very easily be provoked
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.000]   into becoming revolutionaries.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.520]   And Lenin is a perfect example of this
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:12.520]   because his older brother was executed
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:17.680]   as a result of being in a radical revolutionary movement
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.840]   that was, who was arrested and executed
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.440]   for association with terrorism.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.640]   And earlier generations of Russian radicals
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.240]   had founded populist groups
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.560]   that would aim to engage in terrorism
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.160]   and resistance against the Tsarist regime.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:42.000]   And this included people who call themselves nihilists.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.200]   And these nihilists were materialists
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.680]   who saw themselves ushering in a new age
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:54.360]   by absolute rejection of earlier religious traditions
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.960]   and aiming for material answers
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.120]   to the challenges of the day.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:03.320]   Among them was Nikolai Chernyshevsky,
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.200]   who wrote what's been called the worst book ever written.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.720]   It was, in fact, one of Lenin's favorite books.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.800]   In Russian, it's "Что делать?"
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.720]   In English, it gets translated, "What is to be done?"
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.520]   And it's a utopian novel about revolutionaries
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:21.600]   and how revolutionaries should act with one another
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:26.000]   in open ways, new ways, nontraditional ways
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.920]   in order to help usher in the coming revolution.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:33.800]   Lenin loved the work and said it had the great merit
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.480]   of showing you how to be a revolutionary.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.600]   So there's the Marxist influence,
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:43.040]   and then there's Russian populist nihilist influence,
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.040]   which is also a very live current in Lenin's thinking.
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.560]   And when you add these things together,
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.160]   you get an explosive mix.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:57.680]   Because Lenin, as a result and part of this family trauma
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.680]   of his brother, becomes a absolutely irreconcilable enemy
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:08.320]   of the tsarist regime and sets about turning himself
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.560]   into what you might call a guided missile for revolution.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.120]   He turns himself into a machine
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:16.960]   to produce revolutionary change.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.120]   And I mean that with little hyperbole.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.600]   Lenin at one point shared with friends
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.680]   that he loved listening to music,
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:29.040]   but he tried not to listen to beautiful music like Beethoven
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.200]   because it made him feel gentle.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.760]   What the revolution demanded was realism,
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.440]   hardness, absolute steely resolve.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.760]   So Lenin worries even fellow revolutionaries
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:47.480]   by the intensity of his single-minded focus to revolution.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.760]   He spends his days thinking about the revolution.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.320]   He probably dreamt about the revolution.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:58.320]   And so 24/7, it's an existence where he's paired off
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.320]   other human elements quite deliberately
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.600]   in order to turn himself
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:07.040]   into an effective instigator of revolution.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.720]   So when the opportunity comes in 1917,
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.720]   he's primed and ready for that role.
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.480]   - It's interesting that nihilism,
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.120]   Russian nihilism had an impact on Lenin.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.560]   I mean, traditionally nihilist philosophy
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.280]   rejects all sorts of traditional morality.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:28.840]   There's a kind of cynical, dark view and where's the light?
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.120]   - The light is science.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.000]   The light is science and materialism.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   - Oh boy.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.080]   - The nihilists, some of them did a very bad job
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.760]   of hiding their political beliefs
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:42.360]   because they were famous for wearing blue-tinted spectacles,
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.280]   kind of the sunglasses of the late 19th century,
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.320]   as a way of shielding their eyes from light,
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.960]   but also having a dispassionate
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.360]   and realistic view of reality outside.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.720]   So nihilists, as the name would suggest,
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.440]   do reject all prior certainties,
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.280]   but they make an exception for science
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:05.160]   and see that as the possibility for founding
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.360]   an entirely new mode of existence.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.880]   - For most people, I think nihilism is introduced
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.760]   in the brilliant philosophical work,
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.320]   I don't know if you're familiar with it,
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.320]   by the name of The Big Lebowski.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.080]   Nihilists appear there.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.120]   And I think they summarize the nihilist tradition quite well.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.400]   But it is indeed fascinating.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.200]   And also it is fascinating that Lenin,
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.600]   and I'm sure this influenced Stalin as well,
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:36.600]   that hardness was a necessary human characteristics
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:40.160]   to take the revolution to its end.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.040]   - That's right, that's right.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:44.600]   So prior generations of nihilists or populists
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.360]   had resembled Lenin's single-mindedness
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:53.360]   by arguing that one needed total devotion for this.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.720]   This was, if to play this role in society,
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:59.960]   it was not enough to be somewhat committed.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.320]   Total commitment was necessary.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.680]   And the other theme that's at work here obviously is,
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:08.160]   if we consider Lenin affected by Marxist ideas
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.200]   and the homegrown Russian revolutionary tradition
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:16.200]   that predates the arrival of Marxist socialism in Russia,
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:23.560]   it's the theme of needing to adapt to local conditions.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:28.560]   So Marxism or communism in Vietnam or in Cuba
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:34.360]   or in Cambodia or in Russia will be very different
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:38.680]   in its local adaptations and local themes and resonance
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:43.160]   than it was in Germany where Marx
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.560]   would have expected all of this to unfold.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:50.560]   - So let's talk about Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin,
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:54.360]   this little interplay that eventually led to Stalin
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:57.680]   accumulating, grabbing, and taking a hold of power.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:59.140]   What was that process like?
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:05.140]   - So Lenin's supreme confidence leads the party
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.680]   through some really difficult steps.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:12.920]   That involves things like signing the humiliating treaty
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:15.880]   with the Germans, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:18.440]   where critics of the Bolsheviks said that no one
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.080]   who loved their country would have agreed
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:25.040]   to a so draconian, so harsh a settlement
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.760]   that saw the peeling off of large territories
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:29.840]   that had belonged to the Russian empire.
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.740]   Lenin is willing to undertake this
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:33.920]   because of the larger prize.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.760]   He even says that he's not gonna bother to read the treaty
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:39.240]   because shortly that treaty's gonna be a dead letter.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.880]   His expectation is revolution's gonna break out everywhere,
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.440]   especially after we've raised the standard,
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.520]   first of all, in the wreckage of the Russian empire.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.360]   - And we should probably say that that treaty,
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.720]   to some small degree, maybe you can elaborate now or later,
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.960]   lays the groundwork for World War II
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:01.600]   because there is, resentment is a thing
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:04.080]   that with time can lead
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.680]   to just extreme levels of destruction.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:11.680]   - Right, for German sensibilities, for German nationalists,
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.280]   that treaty meant that Germany
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.640]   had essentially won World War I.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:20.480]   And only a turn of events that many of them
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:23.480]   couldn't even follow or conceive of,
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.600]   the arrival of American troops,
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:29.080]   the tipping of the balance in the West led to that reversal.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:33.960]   And one of the many scholars and contemporaries
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:36.760]   pointed out that Germany between the wars
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.240]   was full of people who were convinced
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:40.840]   that Germany had actually not lost the war.
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.560]   However, that victory of theirs was defined.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:46.040]   So most definitely that groundwork is laid.
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.640]   And incidentally,
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.880]   this is something we can talk about later,
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.280]   World War I and World War II
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.880]   have a lot of linkages like that.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.480]   And as time goes by,
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:55.720]   I think historians are gonna focus
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:58.160]   on those linkages even more.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:03.080]   But Lenin also in his leadership against the odds
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:07.560]   leads the Bolsheviks to power in the Russian Civil War
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:11.280]   where most betting people would have given them
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.000]   very slight odds of even surviving
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.200]   given how many enemies they faced off against.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.160]   Lenin's insistence upon discipline
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.880]   and upon good organization
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:27.320]   allowed the Bolsheviks to emerge as the winners.
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.000]   And yet a great disappointment follows.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.720]   Lenin, as we said,
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:37.000]   had expected that revolution will break out soon everywhere
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.520]   and all that'll be necessary for the Bolsheviks to do
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.840]   having given the lead is to link up with others.
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.320]   And so he considered that what would be established
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:51.320]   would be a red bridge between a communist Russia
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:55.080]   and once Germany inevitably plunged ahead
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:58.720]   into its revolutionary transformation, a communist Germany.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.360]   That doesn't end up happening.
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.360]   On the contrary, what happens in Germany
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:05.280]   is a out-and-out shooting war
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.120]   between different kinds of socialists.
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.520]   When Germany establishes a democracy
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:13.560]   that later goes by the name of the Weimar Republic,
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:16.880]   the government is a government of social Democrats,
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.600]   moderate social Democrats who are fearful
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:22.680]   of what they see as Russian conditions of disorder
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.600]   and who are not necessarily in sympathy
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.840]   with the Leninist vision
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.160]   of tightly organized authoritarian rule.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.240]   So communists who revolt in Germany
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:38.720]   are brutally suppressed by mercenaries,
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:43.720]   hardened front fighters and nationalist radicals
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.600]   hired by the German socialist government.
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:50.280]   And the result is a wound that just won't heal
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:53.280]   in the German socialist movement
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.840]   as a result of this fratricide.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.880]   It frustrates Lenin's ambitions.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.560]   So too does the fact that Poland,
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:04.800]   rather than going Bolshevik, resists attempts
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.880]   by the Bolsheviks to move forward
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.440]   and to connect up with Germany.
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:11.560]   The Poles, yet again,
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:14.000]   play a tremendously important historical role
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.800]   in changing the expected course of historical events.
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.880]   It's in the aftermath of these unexpected turns
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.240]   that Lenin and his colleagues realize
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.680]   that they're in this for the long haul.
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:30.120]   It's necessary to wait longer.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:34.160]   They don't lose hope in, or confidence, you might say,
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.400]   in the eventual coming
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.400]   of international workers' revolution,
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.520]   but it's been deferred, it's been put off.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.160]   And so the question then arises,
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.160]   what do you build within a state that's established
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.600]   called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.160]   or the Soviet Union?
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:57.000]   Lenin, as a result of an assassination attempt,
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.680]   is deeply affected in his health
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:05.480]   and would have loved to continue for years longer
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.600]   to steer the regime,
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:12.520]   but he's sidelined because of his declining health.
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.080]   And there emerges a contest,
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:18.080]   a contest between a very charismatic leader,
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:25.320]   Leotrotsky, on the one hand, who is an amazing orator,
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:30.040]   who is an intellectual who has traveled widely in the world,
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:33.880]   who has seen much of the world,
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:38.880]   and who is a brilliant writer, a far-ranging intellect,
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.080]   and is seen as extremely radical
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:45.680]   because of his demand for permanent revolution,
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.120]   the acceleration of revolutionary processes
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.760]   to drive history forward,
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.160]   to strike while the iron is hot,
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:54.160]   and on the other hand,
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:57.600]   is an extremely unlikely contender for power.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:01.160]   And that's a man who's probably the antithesis of charisma,
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:03.280]   if you were to meet him in person,
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:07.280]   a guy with a squeaky, somewhat high-pitched voice,
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:10.240]   not well-suited to revolutionary oratory,
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:16.600]   his face pockmarked with the scars of youthful illness,
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.840]   and who, moreover, doesn't speak
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:22.280]   a fine, sophisticated Russian,
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:25.480]   but speaks a Russian heavily inflected
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.160]   with a Georgian accent from that part of the Russian empire
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.160]   from which he came, and that was Stalin.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.160]   And I know that you already have
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:37.960]   a marvelous interview with Stephen Kotkin,
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:41.560]   the brilliant biographer of Stalin,
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:46.380]   who has so many insights on that subject.
[01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:50.840]   The one thing that, even after reading about Stalin,
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:54.720]   that never ceases to surprise me, even in retrospect,
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:58.680]   is that Stalin gains a reputation,
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:02.760]   not as a fiery radical, but as a moderate,
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:04.800]   a man who's a conciliator,
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.880]   someone who's calm when others are excited,
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:11.840]   someone who is able, because of his organizational skills,
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:15.120]   to resolve merely theoretical disputes
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:17.340]   with practical solutions.
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:20.280]   Now, to fully take this aboard,
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:23.940]   we have to unknow what we know from our vantage point
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:27.260]   about Stalin's leadership, Stalin's brutality
[01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:30.480]   in eliminating his opposition,
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:33.180]   the cult of personality that, against all odds,
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:36.700]   got built up around Stalin so successfully,
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:41.380]   and the absolute dominant role
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:43.380]   that led him later to be described
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:45.320]   as Genghis Khan with a telephone,
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:50.800]   a brutal dictator with ancient barbarism
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:53.400]   allied to the use of modern technology.
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.600]   While Trotsky is delivering stirring speeches
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:00.240]   and theorizing, Stalin works behind the scenes
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:03.960]   to control personnel decisions
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:07.280]   in the Bolshevik movement and in the state.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.440]   And it's a cliche 'cause it's true
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:12.000]   that personnel is policy.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.420]   Trotsky is increasingly sidelined and then demonized
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:18.700]   and eventually expelled from the Soviet Union
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:22.780]   and later murdered in Mexico City.
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:26.540]   For Stalin, eliminating his enemies turned out
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:29.340]   to be the solution that he was most comfortable with.
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:31.260]   - So from that perspective,
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:33.460]   there's a lot of fascinating things here.
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:38.260]   So one is that you can have a wolf,
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:41.100]   a brutal dictator in moderate clothing.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:45.920]   So just because somebody presents as moderate
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.200]   doesn't mean they can't be one of the most destructive,
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.560]   if not the most destructive humans in history.
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.180]   The other aspect is using propaganda,
[01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:58.220]   you can construct an image of a person,
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:02.100]   even though they're uncharismatic, not attractive,
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:05.620]   their voice is no good, all of those aspects,
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:10.520]   you can still have a, like they're still, to this day,
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.460]   a very large number of people that see him
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:17.060]   as a religious type of a godlike figure.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:19.260]   So the power of propaganda there.
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:21.300]   - Today, we would call that curating the image, right?
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.660]   - Curating the image, but to the extent
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:28.340]   to which you can do that effectively is quite incredible.
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:30.900]   So in that way, also, Stalin is a study
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:32.580]   of the power of propaganda.
[01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:35.660]   Can we just talk about the ways
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:38.740]   that the power vacuum is filled by Stalin,
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:41.480]   how that manifests itself?
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:43.320]   Perhaps one angle we can take
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:45.540]   is how is the secret police used?
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:49.120]   How did power manifest itself under Stalin?
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.920]   - Well, before getting to the secret police,
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.220]   I would just wanna add the other crucial element,
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.400]   which is Lenin's patronage.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.720]   Stalin doesn't brawl his way
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.760]   into the Bolshevik party and dominate.
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:06.680]   He's co-opted and promoted to positions of importance
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:11.680]   by Lenin, who sees him as a somewhat rough-around-the-edges,
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.240]   not very sophisticated,
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:17.320]   much less cosmopolitan than other Bolsheviks,
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:21.660]   but dependable, reliable, and committed revolutionary.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:24.760]   So I think that one of the things that's emerged,
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.800]   especially after archives opened up
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:28.360]   with the fall of the Soviet Union
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.960]   and we were able to read more and more
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.520]   of the communications of Lenin,
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:35.320]   is that it's not the case that we're talking here
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:39.360]   about a unconnected series of careers.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.240]   Rather, there are connections to be made.
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.000]   It's true that towards the end of his life,
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.800]   Lenin came to be worried by complaints
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:51.920]   about Stalin's rudeness towards fellow Bolsheviks.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.160]   And in his testament,
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:56.040]   he warned against Stalin's testimonies.
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.680]   Lenin fundamentally saw himself as irreplaceable.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:00.400]   And so that doesn't really help
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.000]   in a succession struggle, right?
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:08.500]   Stalin is able to rely on a secret police apparatus
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:11.540]   that had been built up under Lenin already.
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:16.540]   And it's very early in the foundation of the Soviet state
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:21.900]   that the Cheka, or the Extraordinary Commission,
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:24.540]   is established as a secret police
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:28.420]   to terrify the enemies,
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.660]   beat down the opponents of the regime,
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:34.940]   and to keep an eye on society more generally.
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.300]   The person who's chosen for that task
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:40.740]   also is a anomaly among Bolsheviks.
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:45.420]   That is a man of Polish aristocratic background,
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:47.060]   Felix Dzerzhinsky,
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:50.740]   who comes to be known by the nickname Iron Felix.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:53.420]   Here's a man about whom a cult of personality
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:55.100]   also is created.
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:59.140]   Dzerzhinsky is celebrated in the Soviet period
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:03.580]   as the model of someone who's harsh but fair,
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:07.420]   an executioner but with a heart of gold,
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:09.260]   somebody who loves children,
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:13.220]   somebody who has a tender heart but forces himself
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:17.820]   to be steely-willed against the opponents
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:21.340]   of the ideological project of the Bolsheviks.
[01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:25.040]   Dzerzhinsky is succeeded by figures
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.800]   who will be absolutely instrumental
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.480]   to Stalin's exercise of power,
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.880]   and they're not immune either.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:35.280]   Stalin, in his purges, takes care also
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.200]   to purge the secret police
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:41.520]   as a way of finding others upon whom to deflect blame
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.560]   for earlier atrocities
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:47.520]   and to produce a situation
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:50.880]   where even committed Bolsheviks are uncertain
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:53.120]   of what's going to happen next
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.000]   and feel their own position to be precarious.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.800]   I mean, incidentally, there are other influences
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.060]   that probably are wrought to bear here as well.
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:02.640]   It gets said about Stalin
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.000]   that he used to spend a lot of time
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   flipping through Machiavelli's "The Prince,"
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   and it seems that Stalin's personal copy of "The Prince,"
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.360]   nobody knows where that is, if it still exists,
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:21.520]   but historians have found annotations
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.520]   in works by Lenin that Stalin,
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.760]   who was a voracious reader, as it turns out,
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:30.160]   made in the back of one of the books,
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:32.120]   which sounds almost like a commentary
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.960]   on Machiavelli's almost-but-not-quite suggestion
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.200]   that the ends justify the means.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:43.200]   Stalin's own writing says that if someone is strong,
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:48.120]   active, and intelligent,
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:51.560]   even if they do things that other people condemn,
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.440]   they're still a good person.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:56.340]   And so Stalin's self-conception of himself
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:58.560]   is someone who, along these lines,
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:01.040]   and in line with Lenin's emphasis
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.120]   on practical results and discipline,
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:05.920]   somebody who gets things done,
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:09.400]   that's the crucial ethical standard.
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:13.480]   And ultimately, in criticisms
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:16.960]   by later dissidents of Bolshevik morality,
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:19.960]   this question of what is the ethical standard,
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:22.400]   what is the ethical law,
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.400]   will bring this question into focus,
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:27.200]   because by the,
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:30.040]   and this goes back to Marx as well, incidentally,
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:32.640]   the notion that any ethical system,
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.840]   any notion of right or wrong,
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:37.160]   is purely a product of class identity,
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.680]   because every class produces its distinctive ideas,
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.600]   its distinctive religion, its distinctive art forms,
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.560]   its distinctive styles,
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:51.240]   means that with no one transcendent or absolute morality,
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.720]   it's all up for grabs.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.400]   And then it's a question of power,
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:57.240]   and the exercise of power with no limits,
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.880]   untrammeled by any laws whatsoever.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.200]   Dictatorship in its purest form,
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:03.720]   something that Lenin had avowed,
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:07.060]   and then Stalin comes to practice even more fully.
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.820]   - Not that it's possible to look deep
[01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:13.400]   into a person's heart, but if you look at Trotsky,
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:16.400]   you could say that he probably believed deeply
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.440]   in Marxism and communism.
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.280]   Probably the same with Lenin.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:22.040]   What do you think Stalin believed?
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:24.000]   Was he a believer?
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.640]   Was he a pragmatist that used communism
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:28.280]   as a way to gain power,
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:30.880]   and ideology as part of propaganda,
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.840]   or did he, in his own private moments,
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.560]   deeply believe in this utopia?
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:37.720]   - That's an excellent question, and you're quite right.
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:40.080]   I mean, we cannot peer into the inmost recesses
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.680]   of somebody's being and know for sure.
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:47.440]   My intuition, though, is that this may be
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:51.080]   a false alternative, a false dichotomy.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.000]   It's natural enough to see somebody
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.720]   who does monstrous things to say,
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:58.160]   well, ideology is being used as a cover for it,
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:00.760]   but I think that my suspicion is that these
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:05.200]   were actually perfectly compatible in his historical role.
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:08.080]   The notion that there's an ideology,
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:11.400]   it gives you a master plan for how history
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:14.840]   is going to develop, and your own power,
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:19.840]   the increase of that power to unprecedented proportions,
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:25.160]   your ability to torment even your own faithful followers
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.080]   in order just to see them squirm,
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:32.080]   which Stalin was famous for, to keep people unsettled.
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:37.320]   To me, it seems that for some people,
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:39.320]   those might not actually be opposed,
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:42.040]   might even be mutually reinforcing,
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:44.160]   which is a very scary thought.
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:47.480]   - It's terrifying, but it's really important to understand.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:52.320]   If we look at, once Stalin takes power,
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.840]   at some of the policies,
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:57.940]   so the collectivization of agriculture,
[01:31:57.940 --> 01:32:03.920]   why do you think that failed so catastrophically,
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:09.720]   especially in the 1930s with Ukraine and Polydomor?
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:14.160]   - I think the short answer is that the Bolsheviks
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:17.200]   in particular, but also communists more generally,
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.440]   have had a very conflicted relationship with agriculture.
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:25.440]   Agriculture, as a very vital, obviously,
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:31.280]   but also very traditional and old form of human activity,
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:36.640]   has about it all of the smell of tradition
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:39.260]   and other problematic factors as well.
[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:44.700]   In a place like Russia, or the Russian Empire,
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:48.480]   peasants throughout history for centuries
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:51.600]   had wanted one thing, and that was to be left alone
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:53.080]   to farm their own land.
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:57.720]   That's their utopia.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.960]   And that, for someone like Marx,
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.960]   who had a vision of historical development
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.880]   and transcendence and progress as being absolutely key,
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:09.720]   does not mesh at all with that vision.
[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:14.240]   For that reason, when Marx comes up with this tableau,
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:18.720]   this tremendous display of historical transformation
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:19.960]   taking place over centuries
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:22.340]   and headed towards the final utopia,
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:26.360]   the role of farmers there is negligible.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:30.400]   Peasants get called conservative
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:35.400]   and dull as sacks of potatoes in Marx's historical vision
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:39.660]   because they're limited in their horizon.
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:41.900]   They farm their land, their plot,
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:45.080]   and don't have greater revolutionary goals
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:48.640]   beyond working the land and having it free and clear.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:53.560]   By contrast, industrialization, that's progress.
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:55.680]   I mean, images that today would be deeply disturbing
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:58.080]   to an environmentalist's sensibility.
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:02.280]   Smokestacks, belching smoke, the byproducts of industry,
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:06.780]   a landscape transformed by the factory model,
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:09.960]   that's what Marx, and then later the Bolsheviks,
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:10.980]   have in mind.
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:15.240]   Similarly, the goal, even as articulated
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:20.240]   in Marx's writings, is to put agriculture and farming
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:24.360]   on a factory model so that you won't need to deal
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:27.320]   with this traditional role of the independent farmer
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:28.320]   or the peasant.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.120]   Instead, you'll have people who benefit from progress,
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:35.840]   benefit from rationalization by working factory farms.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:40.880]   So in approaching the question of collectivization,
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.760]   we have to keep in mind that for Stalin and his comrades
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:49.280]   who are bound and determined to drag Russia kicking
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.280]   and screaming into the modern age
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:54.300]   and not to allow it be beaten because of its backwardness,
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:58.120]   as Stalin puts it, traditional forms of agriculture
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:00.720]   are not what they have in mind.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:04.880]   And in their rank of desired outcomes,
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.640]   industrialization, especially massive heavy industry,
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:11.000]   is the sine qua non.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.220]   That's their envisioned future.
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:16.920]   Agriculture rates below.
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:20.280]   So in that case, the crucial significance
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:22.720]   of collectivization is to get a handle
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:25.880]   on the food situation in order to make it predictable
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:28.380]   and not to find oneself in another crisis
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:31.380]   like during the Civil War when the cities are starving,
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:33.160]   industry is robbed of labor,
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:36.640]   and the factories are at a standstill.
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:41.160]   So this is really the core approach to collectivization,
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:45.760]   to put the productive capacities of the farmers
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.640]   in a regimented way, in a state-controlled way,
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:51.920]   under the control of the state.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:56.640]   This produces vast human suffering
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:01.160]   because for the farmers, their plot of land
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.400]   that they thought they had gained
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.640]   as a result of the revolution is now taken away.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:10.120]   They no longer have the same incentives they had before
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:12.160]   to be successful farmers.
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:14.500]   In fact, if you're a successful farmer
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:16.840]   and maybe have a cow as opposed to your neighbors
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:20.520]   who have no cow, you're defamed and denounced
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.760]   as a kulak, a tight-fisted exploiter,
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:27.680]   even though you might be helping to develop agriculture
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.520]   in the region that you're from.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:34.520]   So the result is human tragedy on a vast scale.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:40.000]   And allied to that, incidentally, is Stalin's sense
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.040]   that this is a chance to also target people
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:49.960]   who are opposed to the Bolshevik regime for other reasons,
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:53.320]   whether it's because of their Ukrainian identity,
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:55.840]   whether it's because of a desire
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:58.420]   for a different nationalist project.
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:01.200]   So for Stalin, there are many motives
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:04.720]   that roll into collectivization.
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:07.440]   And the final thing to be said is you're quite right
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:10.600]   that collectivization proves to be a failure
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:14.160]   because the Soviet Union never finally gets a grasp
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:17.200]   on the problems of agricultural production.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.640]   By the end of the Soviet Union,
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:22.160]   they're importing grain from the West
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:28.440]   in spite of having some of tremendously rich farmland
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:29.640]   to be found worldwide.
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:32.820]   And the reason for that had to do in part, I think,
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:35.960]   with the incentives that had been taken away.
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:39.600]   Prosperous individual farmers have a motive
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:44.160]   for working their land and maximizing production.
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:47.360]   By contrast, if you are an employee
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:52.320]   of a factory-style agricultural enterprise,
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:54.720]   the incentives run in very different directions.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.600]   And the joke that was common for decades
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:00.440]   in the Soviet Union and other communist countries
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:03.480]   with similar systems was we pretend to work
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.080]   and they pretend to pay us.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:10.080]   So even labor, which is rhetorically respected
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:14.880]   and valorized in practice is rewarded
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.320]   with very slim rewards.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:19.260]   And the last point, immobility.
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:23.840]   The collectivization reduces the mobility of the peasants
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.720]   who are not allowed because of internal passports
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.160]   to move to the cities unless they have permission.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:30.960]   They're locked in place.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.200]   And you gotta say at the time and afterwards,
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:36.760]   that looked a lot like feudalism or neo-feudalism
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:41.760]   in terms of the restrictions on workers in the countryside.
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:46.640]   - It is a terrifying, horrific, and fascinating study
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:51.340]   of how the ideal, when meeting reality, fails.
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:57.340]   So the idea here is to make agriculture more efficient,
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:39:02.360]   to be more productive, so the industrialized model.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:05.920]   But the implementation through collectivization
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.380]   had all the elements that you've mentioned
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:10.800]   that contended with human nature.
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:12.000]   So first with the kulaks,
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.160]   so the successful farmers were punished.
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:18.840]   And so then the incentive is not just not to be
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:22.200]   a successful farmer, but to hide.
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:25.720]   Added to that, there's a growing quota
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:27.780]   that everybody's supposed to deliver on
[01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:29.520]   that nobody can deliver on.
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:32.240]   And so now, because you can't deliver on that quota,
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:34.580]   you're basically exporting all your food,
[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:37.760]   and you can't even feed yourself.
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:39.720]   And then you suffer more and more and more,
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.720]   and there's a vicious downward spiral
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.960]   of you can't possibly produce that.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.300]   Now there's another human incentive
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:49.960]   where you're gonna lie, everybody lies on the data.
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:54.320]   And so even Stalin himself, probably,
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:57.480]   as evil or incompetent as he may be,
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:00.360]   was not even getting good data about what's even happening.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:03.120]   Even if he wanted to stop the vicious downward cycle,
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:05.040]   which he certainly didn't,
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.420]   but he wouldn't be even able to.
[01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:11.160]   So there's all these dark consequences
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.400]   of what on paper seems like a good ideal.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:20.400]   And it's a fascinating study of things on paper.
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:21.280]   - That's right.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:23.920]   - When implemented, it can go really, really bad.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:24.760]   - That's right.
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:29.240]   And the outcome here is a horrific man-made famine,
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:31.440]   not a natural disaster, not bad harvest,
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:35.040]   but a man-made famine as a result of then the compulsion
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.720]   that gets used by the Soviet state
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:38.520]   to extract those resources.
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:39.840]   Corning off the area,
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:43.200]   not allowing starving people to escape.
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:47.040]   You put very well some of the implications
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:50.800]   of this case study in how things look
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:53.020]   in the abstract versus in practice.
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:58.720]   And those phenomena were going to haunt
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:01.240]   the rest of the experience of the Soviet Union.
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:05.560]   The whole notion that up and down the chain of command,
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:09.280]   everybody is falsifying or tinkering with
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:14.120]   or prettifying the statistics or their reports
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:15.680]   in order not to look bad
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:18.920]   and not to have vengeance visited upon them,
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:22.360]   reaches the point where nobody,
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:25.480]   in spite of the pretense of comprehensive knowledge,
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:28.280]   there's a state planning agency
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:32.640]   that creates five-year plans for the economy as a whole,
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:35.080]   and which is supposed to have accurate statistics,
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:40.080]   all of this is founded upon a foundation of sand.
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:42.440]   That's inadvertent.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.120]   That's not an intended side effect.
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:50.000]   But what you described in terms of the internal dynamics
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.200]   of fostering conflict in a rural society
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.320]   was absolutely not inadvertent.
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:57.880]   That was deliberate.
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:00.760]   The doctrine was you bring civil war.
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:03.520]   Now, had there been social tensions before?
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:04.640]   Of course there had.
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:05.880]   Had there been envies?
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:10.000]   Had there been differentiations in wealth or status?
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.700]   Of course there had been.
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:15.200]   But a deliberate plan to bring class conflict
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:17.600]   and bring civil war and then heighten it
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:20.960]   in the countryside does damage.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:24.100]   And not least of that is this phenomenon
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:25.960]   of a negative selection.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.840]   Those who have most enterprise,
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:30.800]   those who are most entrepreneurial,
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:33.620]   those who have most self-discipline,
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:35.840]   those who are best organized,
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:40.840]   will be winnowed again and again and again,
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:43.420]   sending the message that mediocrity
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:46.920]   is comparatively much safer than talent.
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:51.280]   And this pattern, incidentally, gets transposed,
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:54.560]   and in tremendously harrowing ways also,
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:59.080]   to the entire group of Russian intelligentsia
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:02.100]   and intellectuals of other peoples
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:04.600]   who are in the Soviet Union.
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:07.200]   They discover, similarly,
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:10.960]   that to be independent,
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:15.120]   to have a voice which is not compliant,
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.140]   carries with it tremendous penalties,
[01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:23.280]   especially in Stalin's reigns of terror.
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:26.620]   Again, a difficult question about a psychology
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:28.560]   of one human being.
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:30.760]   But to what degree do you think Stalin
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:36.840]   was deliberately punishing the farmers
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:40.160]   and the Ukrainian farmers?
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:42.640]   And to what degree was he looking the other way
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:48.680]   and allowing the large-scale incompetence,
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:52.320]   the horrific incompetence of the collectivization
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:53.760]   of agriculture to happen?
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:55.520]   - Well, I mean, I think it was both things, right?
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:58.440]   I mean, there were not only sins of omission,
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:00.100]   but also sins of commission.
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:02.760]   Incidentally, one should add,
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:05.200]   I don't think for Stalin it was personal.
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.800]   These are people who are very remote from him,
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:10.680]   never coming into contact with the people
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.180]   who are suffering in this way.
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:15.640]   Attributed to him is the quote
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:17.820]   that one death is a tragedy,
[01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:20.180]   a million deaths is a statistic.
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.680]   I think he, in action, certainly acted
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:25.580]   in a way that would vindicate that.
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:28.560]   But the process of collectivization
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:31.640]   was not just a bureaucratic snafu
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.720]   following a bureaucratic snafu.
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.840]   There was the mobilization of communist youth,
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:42.840]   of military, of party activists to go into the regions
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:45.240]   and to search for hidden food,
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:50.240]   to extract the food where it could be found,
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:55.840]   and we have testimony to this
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:59.120]   in the case of people who later became dissidents,
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:02.100]   like Lev Kopolev, who wrote in his memoirs
[01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:05.160]   about how he was among those
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:07.560]   who were sent in to enact these policies,
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.960]   and he saw families with the last food being taken away,
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:14.200]   even as signs of starvation were visible
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:15.640]   already in the present.
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:18.960]   And yet he did not go mad, he didn't kill himself,
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:21.840]   he didn't fall into despair because he believed,
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:25.540]   because he had been taught and believed, at least then,
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:26.900]   that this was justified,
[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:29.180]   this was a larger historical process,
[01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:33.440]   and a greater good would result even from these enormities.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:37.040]   So I think that this was quite deliberate.
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:42.820]   - Following this, as you've mentioned,
[01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:47.860]   there was the process of the Great Terror,
[01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:49.240]   where the intellectuals,
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:51.520]   where the Communist Party officials,
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:56.100]   the military officers, the bureaucrats, everybody,
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:00.620]   750,000 people were executed,
[01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:03.080]   and over a million people were sent to the Gulag.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:06.600]   What can you say, by way of wisdom,
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:09.580]   from this process of the Great Terror
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:12.680]   that Stalin implemented from '36 to '38?
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.660]   - Well, the terror had a variety of victims.
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:22.340]   There were people who were true believers
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:23.580]   and who were Bolsheviks,
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:25.700]   who were especially targeted by Stalin
[01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:28.740]   because he aimed to revenge himself
[01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:30.300]   for all the sort of condescension
[01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:33.220]   that he'd experienced in that movement before,
[01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:35.180]   and also to eliminate rivals,
[01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:38.660]   or potential rival power centers,
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:40.820]   and members of their families.
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:44.300]   And then there were people who simply got caught up
[01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:48.440]   in a process whereby the repressive organs
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:50.720]   in the provinces were sent quotas.
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:52.440]   You have to achieve your quota,
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:55.000]   and maybe even better yet, overachieve your quota,
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.400]   overperform.
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:57.960]   That would be the key to success
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:02.960]   in rising in the bureaucracies in the Age of the Terror.
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:07.320]   What's so horrifying is the way in which a whole society
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:12.240]   stood paralyzed in this process,
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:15.660]   and how neighbors would be taken away
[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:17.340]   in the middle of the night,
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:21.420]   and people would be wary of talking about it.
[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:26.420]   Resistance, at least in these urban centers,
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:30.740]   was entirely paralyzed by fear
[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:34.520]   when if one had somehow find a way to mobilize,
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:37.820]   somehow a way to resist the process,
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:39.940]   the results might've been different.
[01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:41.420]   There's an astonishing book.
[01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:43.340]   I mean, there are so many great books
[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:46.180]   that have come out quite recently, even on these topics.
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:51.180]   Orlando Fieges has a amazing book called "The Whisperers"
[01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:56.460]   that traces several families' history in the Stalin period.
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:48:02.020]   And it's a testimony to how a whole society,
[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:04.680]   and some of its most intelligent people,
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:07.840]   got winnowed again, and again, and again
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.440]   in that process of negative selection that we talked about,
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:15.600]   the lasting dislocation and scars that this left,
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:18.820]   and the way in which how people were not able
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:20.540]   to talk about these things in public,
[01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:23.560]   because that would put you next on the list,
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:28.560]   suspected of having less than total devotion to the state.
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:32.200]   I think one of the things that also is so terrifying
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:34.960]   about the entire process is even total devotion
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:36.020]   wasn't enough.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:40.240]   The process took on a life of its own.
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:43.640]   And I think that it might even have surprised Stalin
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:48.640]   in some ways, not enough to short-circus the process,
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:52.520]   but the notion where people were invited
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:56.900]   to denounce neighbors, coworkers,
[01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:58.760]   maybe even family members,
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:03.360]   meant that ever larger groups of people
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:06.320]   would be brought into the orbit of the secret police,
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:08.960]   tortured in order to produce confessions.
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:12.640]   Those confessions then would lead to more lists of suspects,
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:16.160]   of people who had to be investigated,
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:19.760]   and either executed or sent to the gulags.
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:25.760]   The uncertainty that this produced was enormous.
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:33.200]   Even loyalty was not enough to save people.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.160]   The stories, Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag Archipelago"
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:40.920]   is full of stories of dedicated communists
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:42.600]   who find themselves in the gulag
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:45.040]   and are sure that some mistake has been made.
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:47.800]   And if only Comrade Stalin would hear
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:50.760]   about this terrible thing that has happened to them,
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:52.880]   surely it would be corrected.
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:56.080]   And nothing like this would have everyone else,
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:59.480]   by contrast, accused of terrible crimes,
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:01.680]   there must be some truth behind that.
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:05.640]   So talk about ways of disaggregating a society,
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:08.240]   ways of breaking down bonds of trust.
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:14.200]   This left lasting traces on an entire society
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:16.160]   that endure to this very day.
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:21.360]   - Yeah, again, a fascinating study of human nature,
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:25.480]   that there essentially was an emergent quota
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:29.400]   of confessions of treason.
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:33.720]   So like, even though the whole society was terrified
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:35.820]   and were through terror loyal,
[01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:40.600]   there still needed to be a lot of confessions
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.200]   of people being disloyal.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:44.080]   So you're just making shit up now.
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:47.760]   Like at a mass scale, stuff is being made up.
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:50.420]   And it's also the machine of the secret police
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:53.440]   starts eating itself because you want to be confessing
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:57.680]   on your boss, on your, and it is just this weird,
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:03.520]   dark, dynamic system where human nature
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:06.000]   just is at its worst.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.700]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:12.480]   - Why, if we look at this deep discussion
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:13.860]   we had about Marxism,
[01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:19.600]   to what degree can we understand from that lens
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:24.120]   why the implementation of communism in the Soviet Union
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:26.800]   failed in such a dark way?
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:29.000]   Both in the economic system with agriculture
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.920]   and industrialization, and on the human way
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:37.360]   with just violation of every possible human right
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:38.680]   and the torture and the suffering
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:42.120]   and gulags and all of this?
[01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:43.840]   - Well, I think some of it comes back
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:47.280]   to the ethical grounding that we mentioned earlier.
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:51.780]   The notion that ethics are entirely situational
[01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:54.060]   and that any ethical system is an outgrowth
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:56.640]   of a particular class reality,
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:58.680]   a particular material reality.
[01:52:00.460 --> 01:52:04.140]   And that leaves the door wide open.
[01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:07.220]   So I think that that aspect was present
[01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:09.060]   from the very beginning.
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:14.060]   I think that the expectations of Marx
[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:19.320]   that the revolution would take hold and be successful
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:22.260]   in a developed country played a role here as well.
[01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:26.660]   Russia, which compared to the rest of Europe
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:30.280]   was less developed even before the First World War,
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:33.300]   is in a dire state after all of the ravage
[01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:36.280]   and the millions of deaths that continue
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.520]   even after the war has ended in the West.
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:42.860]   That leaves precious little in the way
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:47.860]   of structural restraints or a functioning society
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:52.320]   that would say, let's not do things this way.
[01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:55.900]   I think that in retrospect,
[01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:59.020]   that special role carved out for special individuals
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:03.300]   who can move this process forward
[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:05.540]   and accelerate historical development
[01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:10.220]   allowed for people to step into those roles
[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:15.220]   and appoint themselves executors of this ideological vision.
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:18.980]   So I think those things play a role as well.
[01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:20.980]   - Now it's hard to do counterfactual history,
[01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:23.020]   but to what degree is this basically
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:25.780]   that the communist ideals create a power vacuum
[01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:28.220]   and a dictator type figure steps in
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:29.620]   and then it's a roll of the dice
[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:30.940]   of what that dictator is like?
[01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:35.940]   So can you imagine a world where the dictator was Trotsky?
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:39.900]   Would we see very similar type of things?
[01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:41.740]   Or is the hardness and the brutality
[01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:44.780]   of somebody like Stalin manifested itself
[01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:47.700]   in being able to look the other way
[01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:50.340]   as some of these dark things were happening
[01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:53.140]   more so than somebody like Trotsky
[01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:57.840]   who would presumably see the realizations
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:00.020]   of these policies and be shocked?
[01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:02.060]   - Well, counterfactuals are hard, like you said.
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:04.220]   And one very quickly gets off
[01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:07.900]   into really deep waters in speculation.
[01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:09.140]   There were contemporaries,
[01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:10.900]   and there have been scholars since,
[01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:15.020]   who suggest that Trotsky, by all indications,
[01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:17.180]   might've been even more radical than Stalin
[01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:20.020]   in the tempo that he wanted to achieve.
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:25.020]   Think of the slogan of permanent revolution.
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:32.200]   Trotsky also, who dabbled in so many things
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:34.400]   in his intellectual life,
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:37.140]   also spoke in almost utopian terms
[01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:38.580]   that are just astonishing to read,
[01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:40.720]   in utopian terms about the construction
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:42.700]   of the new man and the new woman.
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:46.280]   And that out of the raw material of humanity,
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:47.640]   once you really get going,
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:50.360]   and once you've established a system
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:52.480]   that matches your hopes for the future,
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:54.840]   it'll be possible to reconfigure people.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:57.100]   And I talk about ambition,
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:55:00.740]   to create essentially the next stage in human evolution,
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:04.020]   a new species growing out of humanity.
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:08.740]   Those don't sound like very modest or limited approaches.
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:11.340]   And I guess we just really won't know.
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:14.140]   - Do some of the destructive characteristics
[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:16.580]   of communism have to go hand in hand?
[01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:19.120]   So the central planning that we talked about,
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:22.360]   the censorship of the secret police,
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:27.200]   the concentration of power in one dictatorial figure,
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:31.040]   and, well, let's say, again, with the secret police,
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:33.460]   the violent oppression.
[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:36.680]   - One should add to those factors
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:39.880]   that have a kind of interrelated logic of their own,
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:43.480]   the sheer fact that communism comes to power
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:46.680]   in most of these instances as a result of war,
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:49.440]   as a result of the destruction of what came before
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:50.500]   and a power vacuum.
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:54.520]   So think of the Russian revolutions
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:58.040]   in the wake of the fall of Tsarism.
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:03.040]   Think of the expansion of Stalin's puppet regimes
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:06.240]   into Eastern Europe in the wake of World War II
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:11.080]   and the Red Army moving into occupy areas in Eastern Europe,
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:15.460]   although they announced that they're coming as liberators.
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:19.840]   Consider the foundation of communist China
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:22.480]   on the heels of World War II
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:25.480]   and yet more Chinese civil war.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:30.480]   Consider cases like Korea, Vietnam.
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:35.960]   It's likely that this already is a key element
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:38.780]   in setting things up for further crisis
[01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:43.780]   because upon seizure of power, if your expectation is,
[01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:45.860]   well, it ought to be relatively easy
[01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:48.840]   to get this system rolling and put it on a basis
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:53.140]   that's, after all, we have the roadmap to the future,
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:55.040]   there will follow frustrations
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:57.780]   and impediments and resistance.
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:56:59.820]   And there's a ratchet effect then there
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:03.700]   because it'll produce more repression,
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:06.520]   producing even more problems that follow.
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:08.600]   What drives the whole thing forward though,
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:11.320]   especially in its Leninist version,
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:13.440]   but already visible with Marx and Engels
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:16.340]   is the insistence on confidence.
[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:18.420]   If you have the key to the future,
[01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:21.660]   all of these things are possible and necessary.
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:23.960]   This leads to an ethos, I think,
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:28.960]   that's very hard for historians to quantify
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:34.620]   or to study in a methodical way,
[01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:38.860]   but it's the insistence that you hear with Lenin
[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:41.100]   and then especially with Stalin
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:45.460]   that to be a Bolshevik means to be hard,
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:49.380]   to be realistic, to be consequential,
[01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:52.940]   meaning you don't shy away from doing what needs to be done,
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:57.940]   even if your primordial ethical remainders
[01:57:57.940 --> 01:58:00.620]   from whatever earlier experience you have
[01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:01.840]   rebel against it.
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:05.340]   Under Stalin, there's a constant slogan
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:06.740]   of the Bolshevik tempo.
[01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:10.220]   The Bolsheviks, there's no fortresses that they can't storm.
[01:58:10.220 --> 01:58:12.060]   They can do everything.
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:14.900]   And in a way, this is the assertion
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:17.140]   that it's will over everything.
[01:58:17.140 --> 01:58:21.220]   History can be moved forward and accelerated
[01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:24.180]   and probably your own actions justified as a result,
[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:25.900]   no matter what they were,
[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:29.100]   if you are sufficiently hard and determined
[01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:30.700]   and have the confidence to follow through.
[01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:33.880]   And then that obviously raises the ultimate question,
[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:36.900]   what happens when that confidence ebbs or erodes
[01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:38.260]   or when it's lost?
[01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:44.180]   - If we go to the 1920s, to the home of Karl Marx,
[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:49.740]   fascism as implemented by the Nazi party in Germany
[01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:54.740]   was called the National Socialist German Workers Party.
[01:58:54.740 --> 01:59:01.740]   So what were the similarities and differences of fascism,
[01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:06.260]   socialism, how it was conceived of in fascism and communism?
[01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:08.860]   And maybe you could speak to the broader battle of ideas
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:10.700]   that was happening at the time
[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:12.860]   and battle of political control
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:15.140]   that was happening at the time.
[01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:17.260]   - Well, I mean, there's a whole bunch of terms
[01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:19.380]   that are in play here, right?
[01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:21.740]   And when we speak of fascism,
[01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:26.740]   fascism in its original sense is a radical movement
[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:30.180]   founded in Italy, which though it had been allegedly
[01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:33.220]   on the winning side of World War I,
[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:37.220]   is disappointed with the lack of rise
[01:59:37.220 --> 01:59:39.180]   in national prestige and territory
[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:43.900]   that leads, that commences after the end of the war.
[01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:46.620]   So bizarrely enough, it's a socialist
[01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:48.620]   by the name of Benito Mussolini
[01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:51.700]   who crafts an ideological message
[01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:53.960]   of glorification of the state,
[01:59:53.960 --> 01:59:59.420]   the people at large united in a militaristic way
[01:59:59.420 --> 02:00:03.540]   on the march, ready to attack, ready to expand,
[02:00:03.540 --> 02:00:08.540]   a complete overthrow of liberal ideas
[02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:10.980]   of the rights of the individual
[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:13.460]   or of representative democracy,
[02:00:13.460 --> 02:00:17.120]   and instead vesting power in one leader,
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:19.660]   in his case, the Duce Mussolini,
[02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:24.080]   in order to replicate in peacetime
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:28.400]   the ideal of total military mobilization in wartime.
[02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:36.740]   Although the Nazis in Germany are inspired
[02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:39.660]   and borrow heavily from fascist ideology,
[02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:44.100]   there also are different emphases that they include,
[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:49.100]   and that includes their virulent racism from the outset,
[02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:53.300]   which in addition to a glorification of the state,
[02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:54.820]   glorification of the leader,
[02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:58.720]   and preparation for national greatness,
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:00.820]   race is absolutely core.
[02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:05.140]   And it's that racial radicalism
[02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:07.860]   that the Nazis espouse as a central idea,
[02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:11.260]   along with antisemitism, the demonizing in particular
[02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:14.900]   of the Jews and this insane racialist cosmology
[02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:17.940]   that the Nazis avow.
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:21.900]   It is the assertion that the Nazis
[02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:25.880]   will uniquely bring to pass unity in the people,
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:29.260]   unity in the society that leads them
[02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:34.260]   to give themselves this odd name of national socialist.
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:40.380]   Some leaders like Goebbels among the Nazis
[02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:43.460]   accent the socialist part to begin with,
[02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:47.660]   others put the accent firmly on the nationalist part.
[02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:50.260]   In part, the term they chose for their movement
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:51.660]   was meant to be confusing.
[02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:56.400]   It was meant to take slogans or words
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:58.620]   from different parts of the political spectrum
[02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:01.480]   to fuse them into something unfamiliar and new
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:03.740]   and claim that they'd overcome
[02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:05.320]   all earlier political divisions,
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:09.500]   that the Nazis claimed that they were a movement,
[02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:13.440]   not a party, even though their party was called a party.
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:18.440]   So what did Nazism and Bolshevism and communism share
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:21.240]   or how were they opposed to one another?
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:23.680]   What we need to start with, but making clear,
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:26.000]   they were ideological arch enemies.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.920]   In both worldviews, the opposite side represented
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:33.040]   the ultimate expression of the evil
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:35.080]   that needed to be exercised from history
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:38.600]   in order for their desired utopia to be brought about.
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:41.920]   And this leads to strange
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:45.040]   and perverted beliefs about reality.
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:46.700]   From the perspective of the Nazis,
[02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:51.700]   the Nazis claimed that because they saw the Jews
[02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:55.000]   as a demonic element in human history,
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:59.080]   the Bolsheviks didn't really believe
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:02.840]   all of this economic dialectical materialism.
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:06.200]   They were in fact a racial conspiracy, it was alleged.
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:09.280]   And so the Nazis used the term of Judeo-Bolshevism
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:14.280]   to argue that communism is essentially a conspiracy
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:20.400]   steered by the Jews, which was complete nonsense.
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:23.280]   For their part, the communists,
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:26.240]   and from the perspective of the Soviet Union,
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:31.240]   the Nazis were in essence a super capitalist conspiracy.
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:35.760]   If the cosmological enemy are the capitalists
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:37.800]   and the owners, the exploiters,
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:41.640]   then all of the rigmarole about race
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:44.940]   and nationalism are distractions.
[02:03:44.940 --> 02:03:49.600]   They're meant to fool the poor saps
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:51.520]   who enlist in that movement.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:55.400]   It's essentially steered by capitalist owners
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:00.400]   who is claimed are reduced to this desperate expedient
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:05.000]   of coming up with this thuggish party
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.700]   that represents the last gasp of capitalism.
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:11.600]   So bizarrely enough, from the communist perspective,
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:15.960]   the rise of the Nazis can be interpreted as a good sign
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:18.560]   because it means that capitalism is almost done
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:23.240]   because this is the last undisguised naked face
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:25.520]   of capitalism nearing its end.
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:31.760]   So the other, beyond this ideological total opposition
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:38.840]   in terms of their hoped for futures,
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:44.040]   the reality is that there were aspects
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:45.920]   that were shared on either side.
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:50.920]   And that included the conviction that they could agree
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:53.600]   that the age of democracy was done
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:57.920]   and that the 19th century had had its day
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:01.160]   with experiments with representative democracy,
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:07.240]   the claims of human rights, classical liberal ideas,
[02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:10.240]   and all of this had been revealed as bankrupt.
[02:05:10.240 --> 02:05:11.680]   It had gotten you what?
[02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:14.960]   It got you first the first world war
[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:19.960]   as a total conflict leaving tens of millions dead.
[02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:23.360]   And then economically, the great depression
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:26.960]   showing that the end was not far away.
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:31.640]   This produced at one in the same time,
[02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:35.840]   both ideological opposition and instances
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:38.580]   of vastly cynical cooperation.
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.960]   In terms of the Weimar Republic,
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:45.840]   it's obvious with the benefit of hindsight
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:48.800]   that German democracy had ceased to function
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:51.120]   even before Hitler comes to power.
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:54.160]   But in the process of making democracy unworkable
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:59.160]   in Germany, the extremes,
[02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:04.360]   the Nazi stormtrooper army with their brown shirts
[02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:10.320]   and the communist street fighters had cooperated
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:15.320]   in heightening an atmosphere of civil war
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:19.560]   that left people searching for desperate expedience
[02:06:19.560 --> 02:06:24.300]   in the last days of the Weimar Republic.
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:30.900]   The most compelling case of their cooperation
[02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:35.900]   was the signing of the Nazi-Soviet pact on August 23rd, 1939,
[02:06:35.900 --> 02:06:42.160]   which enables Hitler to start World War II.
[02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:45.680]   A non-aggression pact in official terms,
[02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:50.000]   it contains secret clauses whereby the Nazis
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:54.440]   and the Soviets meeting in Moscow under Stalin's wary eye
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:58.580]   had agreed on territorial division of Eastern Europe
[02:06:58.580 --> 02:07:02.800]   and making common cause as each claiming
[02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:05.320]   to be the winner of the future.
[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:09.480]   So in spite of their oppositions,
[02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:13.400]   these were regimes that were able very cynically
[02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:15.360]   to work together to dire effect.
[02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:19.960]   In the course of the 1950s in particular,
[02:07:19.960 --> 02:07:22.100]   there arose political scientists
[02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:27.100]   who also crafted an explanation for ways
[02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:29.160]   in which these regimes,
[02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:32.200]   although they were opposed to one another,
[02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:37.200]   actually bore morphological resemblances.
[02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:40.360]   They operated in ways that in spite
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:43.220]   of ideological differences bore similarities.
[02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:45.920]   And such political scientists, Hannah Arendt,
[02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:52.080]   chief among them, crafted a model called totalitarianism,
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:54.020]   borrowing a term that the fascists
[02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:57.840]   had liked about themselves to define regimes
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:01.720]   like the Nazis, like Stalin's Soviet Union
[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:05.000]   for a new kind of dictatorship
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:10.000]   that was not a backwards cast revival
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.040]   of ancient barbarism, but was something new,
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:18.020]   a new form of dictatorship that laid total claims
[02:08:18.020 --> 02:08:22.120]   on hearts and minds that didn't want just passive obedience
[02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:24.240]   but wanted fanatical loyalty,
[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:28.200]   that combined fear with compulsion
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:31.720]   in order to generate belief in a system
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:34.880]   or at the very least atomize the masses
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:36.400]   to the point where they would go along
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:38.640]   with the plans of the regime.
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:43.640]   This model has often met with very strong criticism
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:49.080]   on the grounds that no regime in human history
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:52.480]   has yet achieved total control of the population
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:55.680]   under its grip.
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:58.520]   That's true, but that's not what Hannah Arendt was saying.
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:02.160]   Hannah Arendt was saying there will always be
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:05.460]   inefficiencies, there will be resistance,
[02:09:05.460 --> 02:09:09.240]   there will be divergences.
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:12.480]   What was new was not the alleged achievement
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:15.280]   of total control, it was the ambition.
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:16.840]   The articulation of the ambition
[02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:20.080]   that it might be possible to exercise
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:22.640]   such fundamental and thoroughgoing control
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:23.960]   of entire populations.
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:25.960]   And the final frightening thought
[02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:29.600]   that Arendt kept before her was,
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:33.880]   what if this is not a model that comes to us
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:36.200]   from benighted uncivilized ages?
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:39.000]   What if this is what the future is going to look like?
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000]   That's a horrifying intuition.
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.680]   - So let me ask you about Darrell Cooper,
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:46.440]   who is a historian and podcaster,
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:48.360]   did a podcast with Tucker Carlson,
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:50.800]   and he made some claims there
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:53.160]   and elsewhere about World War II.
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:55.440]   There are two claims that I would love
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:57.040]   to get your perspective on.
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:59.560]   First, he stated that Churchill was, quote,
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:02.840]   "The chief villain of the Second World War."
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:05.520]   I think Darrell argues that Churchill forced Hitler
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:08.880]   to expand the war beyond Poland into a global war.
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:13.880]   Second, the mass murder of Jews, Poles, Slavs, Gypsies
[02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:18.880]   in death camps was an accident, a byproduct of a global war.
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:22.880]   And in fact, the most humane extermination
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:25.960]   of prisoners of war possible, given the alternative,
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:28.120]   was death by starvation.
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:29.760]   So I was wondering if you can respond
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:31.280]   to each of those claims.
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:36.120]   - Well, I think that this is a bunch of absurdity,
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:39.840]   and it would be laughable if it wasn't so serious
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:41.880]   in its implications.
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:45.120]   I, to address the points in turn,
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:50.080]   Churchill was not the chief villain of the Second World War.
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:54.720]   The notion that Churchill allegedly forced Hitler
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:56.760]   to escalate and expand a conflict
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:58.760]   that could have been limited to Poland
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:03.760]   is, that assertion is based on a complete neglect
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:08.040]   of what Nazi ideology was.
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:13.040]   The Nazi worldview and racism was not a ideology
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:19.360]   that was limited in its application.
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:22.560]   It looked toward world domination.
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:28.120]   In the years since the Nazis had come to power,
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:31.920]   they sponsored programs of education called geopolitics,
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:35.400]   which urged Germans to think in continents,
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:40.400]   think in continents to see themselves
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:44.520]   as one of the superpowers that would battle
[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:46.680]   for the future of the world.
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:49.200]   And now in retrospect, we of course can see
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:50.720]   that Germany was not in a position
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:54.600]   to legitimate a claim like that,
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:58.600]   but the Nazis' aims were anything but limited.
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:04.120]   In particular, this sort of argument
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:07.600]   has been tried out in different ways before.
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:10.520]   In previous decades, there had been attempts
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:15.280]   by historians who were actually well-read
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:20.280]   and well-published to argue that World War II
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:28.720]   had been in part a contingent event
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:34.760]   that had been brought about by accidents or miscalculations.
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:38.480]   And such explanations argued
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:42.920]   that if you put Hitler's ideology aside,
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:44.240]   you actually could interpret him
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:47.920]   as a pretty traditional German politician
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:49.760]   in the stripe of Bismarck.
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:51.240]   Now, when I say it like that,
[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:53.400]   I think you can spot the problem immediately.
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:56.360]   When you put the ideology aside,
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:02.080]   to try to analyze Hitler's acts or alleged motives
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:03.880]   in the absence of the ideology
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:05.760]   that he himself subscribed to
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:09.320]   and described in hateful detail in "Mein Kampf"
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:12.040]   and other manifestos and speeches
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:17.040]   is an enterprise that's doomed to failure justifiably.
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:20.160]   The notion that the mass murder
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:22.360]   of Jews, Poles, Slavs, and Gypsies
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:27.360]   was an event that simply happened
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:31.440]   as a result of unforeseen events
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:35.040]   and that it was understood as somehow being humane
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:39.320]   also runs contrary to the historical fact.
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:42.360]   When Poland was invaded,
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:44.760]   the Nazis unleashed a killing wave
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:48.120]   in their so-called Operation Tannenberg,
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:50.360]   which sent in specially trained
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:54.120]   and ideologically pre-prepared killers
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:57.640]   who were given the name of the units of the Einsatzgruppen
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:00.360]   in order to wipe out the Polish leadership
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:03.920]   and also to kill Jews.
[02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:08.920]   This predates any of the Operation Barbarossa
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:13.360]   and the Nazis' invasion of the Soviet Union.
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:18.200]   The Nazis, moreover, in many different expressions
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:21.840]   of their ideology, had made clear that their plans,
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:24.200]   you can read this in "Mein Kampf" for Eastern Europe,
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:29.200]   were subjugation and ethnic cleansing on a vast scale.
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:34.640]   So I consider both of these claims absolutely untenable,
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:36.800]   given the facts and documents.
[02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:38.480]   - So do you think it was always the case
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:41.800]   that Nazi Germany was going to invade the Soviet Union?
[02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:43.760]   - I think, as you can read in "Mein Kampf,"
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:47.120]   this is what's necessary in order to bring
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:49.440]   that racial utopia to pass.
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:54.320]   And so while the timetable might be flexible,
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:58.600]   while obviously geopolitical constellations
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:00.360]   would play a role in determining
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:02.480]   when such a thing might be possible,
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:05.560]   it was most definitely on his list.
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:10.080]   And I would want to add that in my own scholarship,
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:14.320]   I've worked to explore some of these themes
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:15.920]   a little bit further.
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:19.040]   My second book, which is entitled
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:20.520]   "The German Myth of the East,"
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:22.960]   which appeared with Oxford University Press,
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:28.720]   examines centuries in the German encounter
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:31.760]   with Eastern Europe and how Germans have thought
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:34.480]   about Eastern Europe, whether in positive ways
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:36.480]   or in negative ways.
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:40.600]   And one thing that emerges from this investigation
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:45.600]   is that even before the Nazis come to power in Germany,
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:50.760]   there are certainly negative and dehumanizing stereotypes
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:54.040]   about Eastern Europeans, some of them activated
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:57.000]   by the experiences of German occupation
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.120]   in some of these regions during the First World War.
[02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:03.720]   But the Nazis take the very most destructive
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:06.000]   and most negative of all those stereotypes
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.200]   and make them the dominant ones,
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:13.040]   making no secret of their expected future
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:16.480]   of domination and annihilation in the East.
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:19.200]   - The idea of Lebensraum,
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:25.360]   is it possible to implement that idea without Ukraine?
[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:30.640]   - Hitler has Ukraine in his horizon
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:32.760]   as one of the chief prizes.
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:37.120]   And the Nazis then craft extensive plans,
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:39.720]   a master plan that they work on
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:41.880]   in draft after draft after draft,
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:44.840]   even as the balance of the war is turning against them
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:45.800]   on the Eastern front.
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:49.360]   This master plan is called the Generalplan Ost,
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:52.120]   meaning the general plan for the East.
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:55.720]   And it foresees things like mega highways
[02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:59.080]   on which the Germanic master race will travel
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:03.160]   to vacation in Crimea, or how their settlements
[02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:05.800]   will be scientifically distributed
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:09.600]   in the wide open spaces of Ukraine for agriculture
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:12.000]   that will feed an expanded
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.360]   and purified Germanic master race.
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:18.160]   So this was not peripheral to the Nazi ambitions,
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:19.880]   but central.
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:21.520]   - As I best understand,
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:27.120]   there is extensive and definitive evidence
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:32.120]   that the Nazis always wanted to invade the Soviet Union.
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:35.280]   And there was always a racial component
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.880]   and not just about the Jews.
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:42.880]   They wanted to enslave and exterminate the Jews, yes,
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:48.760]   but the Slavic people, the Slavs.
[02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:53.760]   And if he was successful at conquering the Soviet Union,
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:58.400]   I think the things that would be done to the Slavic people
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:01.900]   would make the Holocaust seem insignificant.
[02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:06.320]   In my understanding, in terms of the numbers
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:10.280]   and the brutality and the viciousness
[02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:13.080]   in which he characterized the Slavic people.
[02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:18.080]   - In their worldview, the Jews were especially demonized.
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:25.400]   And so the project of the domination of Eastern Europe
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:30.400]   involves this horrific program of mechanized, systematized,
[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:37.160]   bureaucratically organized and horrifyingly efficient
[02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:40.560]   mass murder of the Jewish populations.
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:43.800]   What the Nazis expected for the Slavs
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:45.920]   had a longer timeline.
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:49.040]   Himmler expected the head of the SS,
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:51.680]   the SS is given a special mission
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:53.080]   to be part of the transformation
[02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:55.240]   of these regions ethnically.
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:59.520]   And Himmler in his role of envisioning this German future
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:03.200]   in Eastern Europe gives such a chilling phrase.
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:06.960]   He says that while certain Slavs
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:10.480]   will fall victim immediately,
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:14.560]   some proportion of Slavs will not be shipped out
[02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:16.480]   or deported or annihilated,
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:20.160]   but instead they will remain as slaves for our culture.
[02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:25.160]   And in that one phrase, Himmler managed to defile
[02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:28.800]   and deface everything that the word culture
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:33.120]   had meant to generations of the best German thinkers
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:36.240]   and artists in the centuries before the Nazis.
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:39.960]   The notion of slaves for our culture
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:43.040]   was part of his longer-term expectation.
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:48.040]   And then there's finally a fact that speaks volumes
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:51.360]   about what the Nazis planned for the East.
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:57.080]   Hitler and Himmler envisioned permanent war
[02:19:57.080 --> 02:20:00.520]   on the Eastern front, not a peace treaty,
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:03.000]   not a settlement, not a border,
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:07.280]   but a constant moving of the border every generation,
[02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:10.800]   hundreds of miles East in order to keep winning
[02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:13.680]   more and more living space.
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:17.320]   And with analogy to other frontiers,
[02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:20.280]   to always give more fighting experience
[02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:22.320]   and more training and aggression
[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:26.480]   to generation after generation of German soldiers.
[02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:30.280]   In terms of nightmarish visions, this one's right up there.
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:35.160]   - And always repopulating the land conquered
[02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:37.720]   with the German, the Aryan race.
[02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:41.480]   So in terms of race, repopulating with race
[02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:44.940]   and enslaving the Slavic people and exterminating them,
[02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:46.240]   because there's so many of them,
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:48.520]   it takes a long time to exterminate.
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:52.040]   - And even in the case of the Germans themselves,
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:59.080]   the hidden message behind even Nazi propaganda
[02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:04.080]   about unity and about German national identity
[02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:08.880]   was the Nazis envisioned relentless purges
[02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:11.200]   of the German genetic stock as well.
[02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:15.720]   So among their victims are people with disabilities,
[02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:19.020]   people who are defined as not racially pure enough
[02:21:19.020 --> 02:21:21.720]   for the future, even though they are
[02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:24.080]   clearly Germans by identity.
[02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:29.960]   The full scale and the comprehensive ambitions
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:35.040]   of the Nazis are as breathtaking as they are horrifying.
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:38.920]   - One of the other things I saw, Daryl tweet,
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:42.960]   was that what ended up happening in the Second World War
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:45.640]   was the worst possible thing that could have happened.
[02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:48.040]   And I just also wanted to comment on that,
[02:21:48.040 --> 02:21:52.400]   which I can imagine a very large number
[02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:54.680]   of possible scenarios that could have happened
[02:21:54.680 --> 02:21:56.720]   that are much, much worse,
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:22:00.640]   including the successful conquering of the Soviet Union,
[02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:03.320]   as we said, the kind of things that would be done,
[02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:08.320]   and the total war ever ongoing for generations,
[02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:13.800]   which would result in hundreds of millions of deaths
[02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:15.480]   and torture and enslavement,
[02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:19.240]   and not to mention the other possible trajectory
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:22.200]   of nuclear bomb. - That's right, that's right.
[02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:24.640]   I would think that the Nazis with atomic weapons
[02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:27.280]   with no compunctions about deploying them
[02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:29.960]   would rank up there as even worse
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:32.720]   than the horrors that we saw.
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:34.600]   - Now, let me steel man a point
[02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:36.360]   that was also made as part of this,
[02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:43.080]   that the oversimplified narrative of sort of,
[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:46.440]   to put it crudely, Hitler bad, Churchill good
[02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:52.000]   has been used and abused by neocons and warmongers
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:55.360]   and the military-industrial complex in the years since
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:58.920]   to basically say this particular leader
[02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:02.760]   is just like Hitler, or maybe Hitler in the 1930s,
[02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:04.880]   and we must invade now
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:08.360]   before he becomes the Hitler of the 1940s.
[02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:10.480]   And that has been applied in the Middle East,
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:12.560]   in Eastern Europe, and God forbid,
[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:16.080]   that can be also applied in the war with China
[02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:18.600]   in the 21st century.
[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:23.000]   So yes, warmongers do sure love to use Hitler
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:26.560]   and apply that template to wage war.
[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:30.960]   And we should be wary of that and be careful of that,
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:36.400]   both the over-application of this historical template
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:40.560]   onto the modern world and of warmongers in general.
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:42.280]   - Yeah, and I think that nobody should like
[02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:43.840]   oversimplified narratives.
[02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:47.160]   We need subtle and accurate narratives.
[02:23:47.160 --> 02:23:50.720]   And also, I just would like to say that probably,
[02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:51.960]   as we've been talking about,
[02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:54.960]   Stalin and Hitler are singular figures.
[02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:59.960]   And just as we've been talking about the implementation
[02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:02.880]   of these totalitarian regimes,
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:05.200]   they're singular in human history,
[02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:08.280]   that we never saw anything like it.
[02:24:08.280 --> 02:24:11.120]   And I hope, from everything it looks like,
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:13.440]   we will never see anything like it again.
[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:15.120]   - I mean, they're certainly striking
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:19.120]   and unique historical characters in the record.
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:20.920]   One of the things that's so disturbing
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:23.560]   about Hannah Arendt's model of totalitarianism
[02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:28.240]   is the leader can be changed.
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:31.120]   The system itself demands that there be a leader
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:36.120]   who allegedly is all-powerful and all-knowing
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:38.440]   and prophetic and the like.
[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:43.440]   But whether particular figures are interchangeable
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:48.280]   in that role is a key question.
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:51.600]   - Let me go back to the 1920s
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:54.540]   and sort of ask another counterfactual question.
[02:24:54.540 --> 02:24:59.240]   Given the battle between the Marxists and the communists
[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:01.800]   and national socialists,
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:06.480]   was it possible and what would that world look like
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:08.720]   if the communists indeed won in Germany,
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:11.400]   as Karl Marx envisioned?
[02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:16.280]   And it made total sense given the industrialized expanse
[02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:18.200]   that Germany represented.
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:19.360]   Was that possible?
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:22.300]   And what would it look like if it happened?
[02:25:22.300 --> 02:25:26.120]   - I would think that the reality was probably very remote,
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:28.600]   but that was certainly their ambition.
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:31.720]   German communists get quoted as saying,
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:34.320]   "After Hitler, it's our turn."
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:39.880]   Their sentiment was that the arrival of Nazism on the scene
[02:25:41.100 --> 02:25:46.100]   was a sign of how decrepit and incompetent
[02:25:46.100 --> 02:25:49.280]   and doomed capitalism was.
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:55.640]   In hindsight, that's almost impossible to believe
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:25:58.360]   because what happens is the Nazis
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:01.120]   with their characteristic brutal ruthlessness
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:06.000]   simply decapitate the party and arrest the activists
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.680]   who were supposed to be waiting to take over.
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:10.960]   So that's forestalled.
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:14.400]   A further hypothetical that gets raised a lot
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:17.960]   is couldn't the social Democrats and the communists
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:21.240]   have worked together to keep Hitler out of power?
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:26.480]   That's where the prior history comes into play.
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:31.480]   The very fact that the German revolution in 1919
[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:37.640]   sees socialists killing socialists produces a dynamic
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:44.280]   that's so negative that it's nearly impossible
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:47.280]   to settle on cooperation.
[02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:50.240]   Added to the fact that the communists
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:53.280]   see the social Democrats as rivals
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:56.740]   for the loyalty of the working class.
[02:26:56.740 --> 02:27:00.800]   In terms of just statistical likelihood,
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:03.560]   a lot of experts at the time felt
[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:06.660]   surely the German army is going to step in.
[02:27:06.660 --> 02:27:11.660]   And the most likely outcome would have been
[02:27:11.660 --> 02:27:17.880]   a German general shutting down the democracy
[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:23.140]   and producing a military dictatorship.
[02:27:23.140 --> 02:27:26.500]   It says a lot about how dreadful and bloody
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:28.740]   the record of the Nazis was
[02:27:28.740 --> 02:27:32.000]   that some people in retrospect would have felt
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:35.120]   that that military dictatorship would have been preferable
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:40.120]   if it had obviated the need for the ordeal under the Nazis.
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:44.980]   - What do you think Marx would say about the 20th century?
[02:27:44.980 --> 02:27:50.780]   Let's take it before we get to Mao and China,
[02:27:50.780 --> 02:27:54.260]   just looking at the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.
[02:27:54.260 --> 02:28:00.340]   - That's a really good question.
[02:28:00.340 --> 02:28:05.340]   I think that Marx was flexible in his expectations
[02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:11.840]   about tactics and strategies,
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:17.920]   even as he was sure that he had actually cracked
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:20.300]   a big intellectual problem
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:23.180]   of what the future is going to look like.
[02:28:23.180 --> 02:28:25.700]   So how it would play out,
[02:28:25.700 --> 02:28:28.040]   he was a man who had to deal with a lot of disappointments
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:30.800]   because in revolutionary uprising
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:32.200]   after revolutionary uprising,
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:37.200]   whether it was in the revolutions of 1848 across Europe,
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:39.240]   whether it was in Poland,
[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:43.280]   whether it was in the Paris commune,
[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:47.660]   this is it, this is the outbreak of the real thing.
[02:28:47.660 --> 02:28:50.380]   And then it doesn't end up happening.
[02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:53.100]   So I think that he'd probably have tried to be patient
[02:28:53.100 --> 02:28:55.620]   about the turn of events.
[02:28:55.620 --> 02:28:59.460]   - We mentioned at the outset that Marx felt it was unlikely
[02:28:59.460 --> 02:29:03.260]   that a workers' revolution would break out
[02:29:03.260 --> 02:29:05.820]   in the Russian empire,
[02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:09.020]   because for that you needed lots of industrial workers
[02:29:09.020 --> 02:29:11.280]   and they didn't have a lot of industry.
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:13.240]   There's a footnote to add there,
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:15.580]   and it proves his flexibility.
[02:29:15.580 --> 02:29:19.940]   A Russian socialist wrote to Marx asking,
[02:29:19.940 --> 02:29:23.700]   might it not be possible for Russia
[02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:27.780]   to escape some stages of capitalist development?
[02:29:27.780 --> 02:29:30.860]   I mean, do you have to rigidly follow that scheme?
[02:29:30.860 --> 02:29:35.860]   And Marx's answer was convoluted, but it wasn't a no.
[02:29:35.860 --> 02:29:41.220]   And that suggests that Marx was willing to entertain
[02:29:41.220 --> 02:29:44.920]   all sorts of possible scenarios.
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:47.520]   I think he would certainly have been very surprised
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:50.680]   at the course of events as it unfolded,
[02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:54.940]   because it didn't match his expectations at the outset.
[02:29:54.940 --> 02:29:57.480]   - Not to put this on him,
[02:29:57.480 --> 02:30:02.220]   but would he be okay with the price of Holodomor
[02:30:02.220 --> 02:30:08.440]   for the utopian destination of communism?
[02:30:08.440 --> 02:30:12.880]   Meaning, is it okay to crack a few eggs to make an omelet?
[02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:16.560]   - Well, we don't know what Marx would say
[02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:18.600]   if he were posed that question deliberately,
[02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:21.760]   but we do know in the case of a Marxist historian,
[02:30:21.760 --> 02:30:26.760]   Eric Hobsbawm, who was a prolific and celebrated
[02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:30.600]   British historian of the 19th and 20th centuries.
[02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:33.680]   And he was put this question in the '90s
[02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:36.300]   after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[02:30:36.300 --> 02:30:39.180]   And he stated forthrightly that
[02:30:39.180 --> 02:30:43.880]   because the Soviet Union failed,
[02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:48.280]   such sacrifices were inordinate.
[02:30:48.280 --> 02:30:54.040]   But if the experiment had succeeded
[02:30:54.040 --> 02:30:57.200]   and a glorious future had been open for mankind
[02:30:57.200 --> 02:30:59.640]   as a result of the Soviet Union's success,
[02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:04.160]   that would lead to a different reply.
[02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:10.600]   And that is one person's perspective.
[02:31:12.640 --> 02:31:15.040]   So that takes us to the other side of the world.
[02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:19.760]   The side that's often in the West,
[02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:23.960]   not considered very much when we talk about human history.
[02:31:23.960 --> 02:31:28.960]   Chinese dynasties, empires are fascinating, complex,
[02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:33.240]   and there's just a history that's not
[02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:35.860]   as deeply explored as it should be.
[02:31:35.860 --> 02:31:38.560]   And the same applies to the 20th century.
[02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:41.640]   So Chinese radicals founded
[02:31:41.640 --> 02:31:45.820]   the Chinese Communist Party, CCP, in July, 1921.
[02:31:45.820 --> 02:31:51.000]   Among them, as you talk about, was Mao.
[02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.580]   What was the story of Mao's rise to power?
[02:31:53.580 --> 02:31:58.580]   - So Mao takes a page from the Book of Lenin
[02:31:58.580 --> 02:32:05.640]   by adapting or seeking to adapt Marx's ideology
[02:32:08.200 --> 02:32:11.600]   to a context that would have surprised Marx significantly.
[02:32:11.600 --> 02:32:16.600]   And that is not only to set the revolution
[02:32:16.600 --> 02:32:21.100]   in an as-yet-not-industrialized country,
[02:32:21.100 --> 02:32:23.640]   but moreover, to make the peasants,
[02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:26.240]   rather than being conservative sacks of potatoes,
[02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:28.800]   to make them into the prime movers
[02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:32.100]   of the success of this political venture.
[02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:37.380]   That's a case of the phenomenon
[02:32:37.380 --> 02:32:38.880]   that we talked about earlier.
[02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:44.180]   When is an adaptation of an ideology
[02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:47.080]   or a change to an ideology
[02:32:47.080 --> 02:32:52.080]   a valid adjustment that you've made or adaptation?
[02:32:52.080 --> 02:32:56.320]   And when is it already so different
[02:32:56.320 --> 02:32:58.880]   that it's something entirely distinct?
[02:33:00.700 --> 02:33:05.700]   Maoism was very clearly intended to answer this question
[02:33:05.700 --> 02:33:10.100]   for the Chinese context and, by implication,
[02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:12.860]   other non-Western parts of the world.
[02:33:12.860 --> 02:33:16.720]   This was, in part, Mao's way, whose ambition was great,
[02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:18.660]   to put himself at the head
[02:33:18.660 --> 02:33:21.500]   of a successful international movement
[02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:25.100]   and to be the successor to Stalin,
[02:33:25.100 --> 02:33:29.580]   whose role he both admired and resented
[02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:32.260]   from having to be the junior partner.
[02:33:32.260 --> 02:33:34.780]   To take an example of a masterwork
[02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:39.780]   in a major milestone in the history of communism,
[02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:44.060]   the Polish philosopher Leszek Kowalkowski,
[02:33:44.060 --> 02:33:48.380]   who was at first a committed communist
[02:33:48.380 --> 02:33:50.060]   and then later became disillusioned
[02:33:50.060 --> 02:33:53.620]   and wrote a three-volume study of Marxist thought
[02:33:53.620 --> 02:33:56.260]   called "Currents of Marxism,"
[02:33:56.260 --> 02:34:00.620]   in that book, when he reaches Maoism,
[02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:03.000]   Kowalkowski essentially throws up his hands
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.980]   and says it's hard to even know what to do with this
[02:34:05.980 --> 02:34:10.980]   because putting the peasantry in the vanguard role
[02:34:10.980 --> 02:34:15.020]   is something that is already at variance
[02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:17.020]   with the original design,
[02:34:17.020 --> 02:34:19.580]   but Marx says this is an improved version,
[02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:23.100]   this is an adapted and truer version of Marxism
[02:34:23.100 --> 02:34:25.160]   for the Chinese context.
[02:34:26.120 --> 02:34:31.120]   In case after case in Mao's rise to power,
[02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:35.040]   we see a really complicated relationship with Stalin.
[02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:38.120]   He works hard to gain Stalin's support
[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:39.960]   because the Comintern,
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:44.040]   the international organization headquartered in Moscow,
[02:34:44.040 --> 02:34:48.120]   working to encourage and help revolutionaries worldwide
[02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:51.560]   is skeptical about the Chinese communists to begin with
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:55.280]   and believes that China still has a long way to go
[02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:56.820]   before it's reached the stage
[02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:59.560]   where it's ripe for communist revolution.
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:02.260]   And in a way, that's more orthodox Marxism
[02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:04.120]   than what Mao is championing.
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:10.600]   Mao chafes under Stalin's acknowledged leadership
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:14.320]   of international communism as a movement.
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:19.320]   And in 1950, when Mao goes to visit Stalin in Moscow
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:23.640]   in order to sign a treaty of cooperation,
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:26.880]   he's left waiting for days and days and days
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:30.160]   in a snub that is meant to show him
[02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:32.080]   that you're just not as important
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:33.560]   as you might think you are.
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:37.000]   And then when Stalin dies in 1953,
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.600]   Mao feels the moment is ready for him
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:44.760]   to step into the leadership position
[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:47.200]   surpassing the Soviet Union.
[02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:51.720]   So many of Mao's actions like the Great Leap Forward
[02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:55.380]   and the agricultural disasters that follow from that
[02:35:55.380 --> 02:35:59.240]   are literally attempts to outdo Stalin,
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:00.920]   to outperform Stalin,
[02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:04.280]   to show that what Stalin was not able to do,
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:08.600]   the Chinese communist regime will be able to bring off.
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:13.440]   And the toll for that hubris is vast.
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:17.480]   - Yeah, in the darkest of ways, he did outdo Stalin.
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:19.840]   - That's right, in the statistics.
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:22.320]   - The Great Leap Forward ended up killing
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:26.200]   approximately 40 million people from starvation or murder.
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:29.960]   Can you describe the Great Leap Forward?
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:32.980]   - So it was modeled on the crash industrialization
[02:36:32.980 --> 02:36:35.600]   that Stalin had wanted to undertake in the Soviet Union
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:37.580]   and to outdo it.
[02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:39.060]   The notion of the Great Leap Forward
[02:36:39.060 --> 02:36:42.400]   was that it would be possible for the peasant masses
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:44.960]   out of their conviction in the rightness
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:46.800]   of the Chinese communist cause
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:50.000]   to industrialize China overnight.
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:54.520]   That involved things like creating small smelting furnaces
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:57.680]   in individual farm communes.
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:02.680]   It involved folding together farming territories
[02:37:02.680 --> 02:37:06.480]   into vast communes of very large size
[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:09.640]   that were just because of their sheer gigantism
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:12.240]   supposed to be by definition more efficient
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:13.780]   than small-scale farming.
[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:20.040]   It ended up producing environmental disasters
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:25.040]   and campaigns to eliminate birds or insects
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:30.300]   were supposed to demonstrate mastery over nature
[02:37:30.300 --> 02:37:32.840]   by sheer acts of will.
[02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:34.840]   These included things like
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:39.840]   adopting Soviet agricultural techniques
[02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:44.080]   that were pioneered by a crackpot biologist
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:46.080]   by the name of Trofim Lysenko
[02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:49.960]   that produced more agricultural disaster.
[02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:53.760]   That involved things like plowing to depths
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:58.040]   that were not practical for the seeds to germinate and grow
[02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:00.600]   but were supposed to produce super plants
[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:04.120]   that would produce bumper harvests
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:07.860]   and outpace the capitalist countries and the Soviet Union.
[02:38:07.860 --> 02:38:12.860]   So the context for all of this is a race to get first
[02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:18.720]   to the achievement of full-scale communism.
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:22.680]   One of the themes that I think it's so valuable to pursue
[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:25.160]   and to take seriously in the history of communism
[02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:28.680]   is what concrete promises were made.
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:33.680]   In the case of China,
[02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:38.880]   Mao made promises and projections for the future
[02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:43.180]   that were worrying even to some of his own assistants.
[02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:47.940]   He exclaimed that perhaps by 1961,
[02:38:47.940 --> 02:38:50.260]   perhaps by 1973,
[02:38:50.260 --> 02:38:52.580]   China would be the winner in this competition
[02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:54.780]   and it would have achieved full communism.
[02:38:54.780 --> 02:38:58.500]   So that which Marx had sketched as the endpoint of humanity
[02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:01.580]   would be achieved first by the Chinese.
[02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:06.460]   Later, his own comrades, when he passed from the scene,
[02:39:06.460 --> 02:39:08.740]   felt the need to temper that a little bit
[02:39:08.740 --> 02:39:11.200]   and promised that they would achieve full communism
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:12.700]   by the year 2000.
[02:39:12.700 --> 02:39:19.520]   Such promises are helpful to a regime to create enthusiasm
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:23.780]   and to hold out to people the prospect of real successes
[02:39:23.780 --> 02:39:25.380]   just around the corner.
[02:39:25.380 --> 02:39:27.860]   But what happens when the date arrives
[02:39:27.860 --> 02:39:30.620]   and you haven't actually achieved that goal?
[02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:33.660]   That's one ticking time bomb that played a role
[02:39:33.660 --> 02:39:38.300]   in the increasing erosion of confidence in the Soviet Union.
[02:39:38.300 --> 02:39:41.700]   And the case of China must have been something similar.
[02:39:41.700 --> 02:39:43.020]   - So there's a lot of other elements
[02:39:43.020 --> 02:39:46.820]   that are similar to the Soviet Union.
[02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:51.700]   Maybe you could speak to the Hundred Flowers Campaign.
[02:39:51.700 --> 02:39:55.620]   - The Hundred Flowers Campaign is a chance for Mao
[02:39:55.620 --> 02:40:00.620]   who has felt that he has lost prestige
[02:40:00.620 --> 02:40:02.600]   and lost standing in the party
[02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:05.700]   because of the disasters of the Great Leap Forward
[02:40:05.700 --> 02:40:08.820]   to regain some of that momentum.
[02:40:08.820 --> 02:40:12.180]   And the whole Hundred Flowers Campaign,
[02:40:12.180 --> 02:40:15.700]   officially titled the Rectification Campaign
[02:40:15.700 --> 02:40:20.100]   to set things right, is still shrouded in mystery.
[02:40:20.100 --> 02:40:23.220]   Historians disagree about how to interpret
[02:40:23.220 --> 02:40:25.660]   what Mao was actually up to.
[02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:30.140]   The most cynical variant is that Mao encouraged
[02:40:30.140 --> 02:40:35.140]   Chinese thinkers and intellectuals to share ideas
[02:40:35.140 --> 02:40:39.820]   and to engage in constructive criticism,
[02:40:39.820 --> 02:40:42.140]   to propose alternatives,
[02:40:42.140 --> 02:40:45.420]   and to let a full discussion happen.
[02:40:45.420 --> 02:40:48.940]   And then, after some of them had ventured that,
[02:40:48.940 --> 02:40:50.820]   to come in and purge them,
[02:40:50.820 --> 02:40:52.820]   to punish them ruthlessly for having done
[02:40:52.820 --> 02:40:54.960]   what he had invited them to do.
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:58.140]   That is the most cynical variant.
[02:40:58.140 --> 02:41:01.820]   Some historians argue that Mao himself
[02:41:01.820 --> 02:41:05.260]   was not prepared for the ideas
[02:41:05.260 --> 02:41:08.620]   that he himself had invited into the public square,
[02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:12.980]   and that he grew anxious and worried and angry at this
[02:41:12.980 --> 02:41:14.700]   without having thought this through
[02:41:14.700 --> 02:41:16.400]   in a cynical way to begin with.
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:18.020]   The end result is the same.
[02:41:18.020 --> 02:41:21.740]   The end result is, once again, negative selection,
[02:41:21.740 --> 02:41:24.780]   the decimation of those who are most venturesome,
[02:41:24.780 --> 02:41:27.220]   those who are most talented and intelligent,
[02:41:27.220 --> 02:41:29.200]   are punished relentlessly for that.
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:35.380]   - And just a general culture of censorship and fear,
[02:41:35.380 --> 02:41:37.460]   and all the same stuff we saw in the Soviet Union.
[02:41:37.460 --> 02:41:38.300]   - That's right.
[02:41:38.300 --> 02:41:40.620]   I mean, think of the impact on officials
[02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:42.340]   who are loyal servants of the regime
[02:41:42.340 --> 02:41:43.780]   and just wanna get along.
[02:41:43.780 --> 02:41:45.820]   The message goes out loud and clear.
[02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:47.300]   Don't be venturesome.
[02:41:47.300 --> 02:41:48.980]   Do not propose reforms.
[02:41:48.980 --> 02:41:50.260]   Stick with the tried and true,
[02:41:50.260 --> 02:41:51.540]   and that'll be the safe route,
[02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:54.740]   even if it ends in, ultimately, stagnation.
[02:41:54.740 --> 02:41:58.620]   - So as the same question I asked about the Soviet Union,
[02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:01.380]   why do you think there was so much failure
[02:42:01.380 --> 02:42:06.380]   of policies that Mao implemented in China during his rule?
[02:42:06.380 --> 02:42:10.420]   - Mao himself had a view of human beings
[02:42:10.420 --> 02:42:13.500]   as being, as he put it, beautiful blank pieces of paper
[02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:16.420]   upon which one can write new characters.
[02:42:16.420 --> 02:42:21.420]   And that is clearly at variance
[02:42:21.420 --> 02:42:24.540]   with what you and I know about the complex nature
[02:42:24.540 --> 02:42:27.500]   of human beings as we actually encounter them in the world.
[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:31.380]   I think that in the process of hatching schemes
[02:42:31.380 --> 02:42:35.220]   that were one-size-fits-all for a country as big
[02:42:35.220 --> 02:42:40.220]   and as varied in its communities as China,
[02:42:40.220 --> 02:42:44.860]   inevitably, such an imposition of one model
[02:42:44.860 --> 02:42:49.700]   was going to lead to serious malfunctions.
[02:42:49.700 --> 02:42:53.580]   And so much of what other episodes
[02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:54.860]   in Chinese history had showed,
[02:42:54.860 --> 02:42:57.300]   the entrepreneurial capacity,
[02:42:57.300 --> 02:42:59.660]   the productive capacity, economically,
[02:42:59.660 --> 02:43:02.060]   of the Chinese people was suppressed
[02:43:02.060 --> 02:43:05.180]   by being fitted into these rigid schemes.
[02:43:05.180 --> 02:43:09.500]   What we've seen since, after Mao passes from the scene
[02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:12.420]   and with the reforms of Deng Xiaoping,
[02:43:12.420 --> 02:43:15.760]   one sees just how much of those energies
[02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:18.140]   had been forcibly suppressed for so long
[02:43:18.140 --> 02:43:20.020]   and now were allowed to reemerge.
[02:43:20.020 --> 02:43:25.100]   - Mao died in 1976.
[02:43:25.100 --> 02:43:29.100]   You wrote that the CCP in '81,
[02:43:29.100 --> 02:43:32.620]   looking back through the lens of historical analysis,
[02:43:32.620 --> 02:43:35.140]   said that he was 70% correct.
[02:43:35.140 --> 02:43:38.780]   Seven, zero, exactly 70% correct.
[02:43:38.780 --> 02:43:41.020]   - Yeah, not 69, not 71.
[02:43:41.020 --> 02:43:44.000]   The scientific precision, I mean,
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.860]   we should say that again and again.
[02:43:46.860 --> 02:43:52.020]   The co-opting of the authority of science
[02:43:52.020 --> 02:43:56.480]   by the Soviet Union, by Mao,
[02:43:56.480 --> 02:43:59.800]   by Nazi Germany, Nazi science,
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:06.100]   is terrifying and should serve as a reminder
[02:44:06.100 --> 02:44:08.460]   that science is the thing
[02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:12.620]   that is one of the most beautiful creations of humanity,
[02:44:12.620 --> 02:44:15.880]   but is also a thing that could be used
[02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:19.740]   by politicians and dictators to do horrific things.
[02:44:19.740 --> 02:44:23.180]   - Its essence is questing, not certainty.
[02:44:23.180 --> 02:44:24.180]   - Yeah. - Constant questing.
[02:44:24.180 --> 02:44:25.620]   - Exactly.
[02:44:25.620 --> 02:44:29.620]   Humility, intellectual humility.
[02:44:29.620 --> 02:44:34.960]   So how did China evolve after Mao's death to today?
[02:44:36.180 --> 02:44:40.940]   - Well, I think that there is, without denouncing Mao,
[02:44:40.940 --> 02:44:46.920]   without repudiating Mao's 70% correctness,
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:52.100]   the regime actually undertook a new venture,
[02:44:52.100 --> 02:44:55.020]   and that venture was to open up economically,
[02:44:55.020 --> 02:44:59.240]   to gain access to world markets,
[02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:04.200]   and to play a global role,
[02:45:05.300 --> 02:45:06.660]   always with the proviso
[02:45:06.660 --> 02:45:10.660]   that the party retained political supremacy.
[02:45:10.660 --> 02:45:14.380]   It's been pointed out that while Khrushchev
[02:45:14.380 --> 02:45:17.420]   tries in the Soviet Union in 1956,
[02:45:17.420 --> 02:45:19.260]   especially with a secret speech
[02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:21.580]   in which he denounces Stalin's crimes,
[02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:26.660]   he tries to go back to the founders' intentions of Lenin.
[02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:30.060]   Nothing like that, it's argued,
[02:45:30.060 --> 02:45:32.480]   is possible in the Chinese case,
[02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:35.860]   because Mao was not the equivalent of Stalin
[02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:40.020]   for communist China, Mao was the equivalent of Lenin.
[02:45:40.020 --> 02:45:43.540]   Mao was the founder, so there's no repudiating of him.
[02:45:43.540 --> 02:45:45.740]   They are stuck with that formula of 70%,
[02:45:45.740 --> 02:45:48.500]   and acknowledging that there were some problems,
[02:45:48.500 --> 02:45:52.700]   but by and large arguing that it was the correct stance
[02:45:52.700 --> 02:45:56.020]   of the party and its leader that was paramount.
[02:45:56.020 --> 02:46:01.020]   And the results of this wager are where we are today.
[02:46:02.420 --> 02:46:05.880]   China has been transformed out of all recognition
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:10.380]   in terms of not all of the living standards of the country,
[02:46:10.380 --> 02:46:11.840]   but many places.
[02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:17.240]   Its economic growth has been dramatic,
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:22.160]   and the new dispensation is such that people ask,
[02:46:22.160 --> 02:46:25.320]   is this a communist country anymore?
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:26.640]   And that's probably a question
[02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:30.120]   that haunts China's current leadership as well.
[02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:35.120]   With Chairman Xi, we've seen a return to earlier patterns.
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:40.980]   Xi insisting that Mao's achievement has to be held as equal
[02:46:40.980 --> 02:46:43.340]   to that of the reform period.
[02:46:43.340 --> 02:46:47.940]   Sometimes, imitations or nostalgia for the Mao period,
[02:46:47.940 --> 02:46:51.020]   or even the sufferings of the Cultural Revolution,
[02:46:51.020 --> 02:46:53.240]   are part of this volatile mix.
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:59.420]   But all of this is outward appearance.
[02:46:59.420 --> 02:47:02.660]   Statistics can also be misleading.
[02:47:02.660 --> 02:47:06.940]   And I think that very much in question
[02:47:06.940 --> 02:47:09.940]   is China's further revolution in our own times.
[02:47:09.940 --> 02:47:15.120]   - In the West, China is often demonized.
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:20.860]   And we've talked extensively today
[02:47:20.860 --> 02:47:23.260]   about the atrocities that result from,
[02:47:23.260 --> 02:47:28.040]   atrocities both internal and external
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:31.120]   that result from the communist nations.
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:37.980]   But what can we say by way of hope
[02:47:37.980 --> 02:47:42.140]   to resist the demonization?
[02:47:42.140 --> 02:47:47.740]   How can we avoid cold or hot war with China,
[02:47:47.740 --> 02:47:52.160]   we being the West or the United States in the 21st century?
[02:47:53.980 --> 02:47:55.680]   - Well, you mentioned in the context
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:48:00.680]   of the claims of science, humility as a crucial attribute.
[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:06.220]   I think that humility, sobriety, realism
[02:48:06.220 --> 02:48:09.800]   are tremendously valuable in trying to understand
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:13.600]   another society, another form of government.
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:17.920]   And so I think one needs to be very self-aware
[02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:22.700]   that projection onto others of what we think they're about
[02:48:22.700 --> 02:48:26.220]   is no substitute for actual study
[02:48:26.220 --> 02:48:29.380]   of the sources that a society like that produces.
[02:48:29.380 --> 02:48:33.060]   It's declarations of what matters most to them.
[02:48:33.060 --> 02:48:35.180]   The leadership's own pronouncements
[02:48:35.180 --> 02:48:37.160]   about what the future holds.
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:41.500]   I think that matters a lot more than pious hopes
[02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:46.500]   or versions of being convinced that inevitably
[02:48:46.500 --> 02:48:52.260]   everyone will come to resemble us in a better future.
[02:48:52.260 --> 02:48:54.020]   - You mentioned this earlier,
[02:48:54.020 --> 02:48:56.540]   but just to take a small detour,
[02:48:56.540 --> 02:48:59.820]   what are we supposed to think about North Korea
[02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:03.380]   and their declaration that they're supposedly
[02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:05.040]   a communist nation?
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:10.300]   What can we say about the economic,
[02:49:10.300 --> 02:49:12.700]   the political system of North Korea?
[02:49:12.700 --> 02:49:16.380]   Or is it just like a hopelessly simple answer
[02:49:16.380 --> 02:49:20.700]   of this is a complete disaster of a totalitarian state?
[02:49:21.740 --> 02:49:25.060]   - So I think the answer that a historian can give
[02:49:25.060 --> 02:49:26.620]   is a historical answer, right?
[02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:29.780]   That we have to inquire into what has to happen
[02:49:29.780 --> 02:49:32.780]   in order to arrive at the past we are today.
[02:49:32.780 --> 02:49:36.100]   We have a regime that's claiming to be communist
[02:49:36.100 --> 02:49:41.100]   or has an even better version of Marx's original ideas
[02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:45.760]   in the form of a Korean adaptation called "Yuche."
[02:49:48.140 --> 02:49:51.780]   How does that mesh with the reality
[02:49:51.780 --> 02:49:53.780]   that we're talking about a dynastic government
[02:49:53.780 --> 02:49:55.780]   and a monarchy in all but name,
[02:49:55.780 --> 02:49:59.380]   but a communist monarchy if that's what it is.
[02:49:59.380 --> 02:50:04.380]   I think that examining as much as we can learn
[02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:11.060]   about a closed society that goes about its every day
[02:50:11.060 --> 02:50:14.520]   in ways that are inscrutable to us
[02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:16.300]   is very, very challenging.
[02:50:16.300 --> 02:50:18.100]   But the only answer,
[02:50:18.100 --> 02:50:21.640]   when an example like this escapes your analytic categories,
[02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:24.940]   probably there's a problem with your analytical categories
[02:50:24.940 --> 02:50:27.660]   rather than the example being the problem
[02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:29.060]   in all its messiness.
[02:50:29.060 --> 02:50:30.380]   - Yeah, so there's a component here
[02:50:30.380 --> 02:50:32.860]   in the release of China as well
[02:50:32.860 --> 02:50:36.420]   to bring somebody like John Mearsheimer into the picture.
[02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:38.320]   There's a military component here too.
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:43.380]   And that is ultimately how these nations interact,
[02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:45.500]   especially totalitarian nations interact
[02:50:45.500 --> 02:50:46.700]   with the rest of the world.
[02:50:46.700 --> 02:50:51.700]   So nations interact economically, culturally,
[02:50:51.700 --> 02:50:53.300]   and militarily.
[02:50:53.300 --> 02:50:57.140]   And the concern with countries like North Korea
[02:50:57.140 --> 02:51:01.340]   is the way for them to be present on the world stage
[02:51:01.340 --> 02:51:05.300]   in the game of geopolitics
[02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:08.540]   is by flexing their military might.
[02:51:08.540 --> 02:51:12.380]   And they invest a huge amount of their GDP
[02:51:12.380 --> 02:51:14.580]   into the military.
[02:51:14.580 --> 02:51:19.060]   So I guess the question there to discuss
[02:51:19.060 --> 02:51:20.980]   in terms of analysis is
[02:51:20.980 --> 02:51:25.700]   how do we deal with this kind of system
[02:51:25.700 --> 02:51:28.840]   that claims to be a communist system?
[02:51:28.840 --> 02:51:31.580]   And what lessons can we take from history
[02:51:31.580 --> 02:51:34.060]   and apply it to that?
[02:51:34.060 --> 02:51:36.500]   Or should we simply just ignore and look the other way
[02:51:36.500 --> 02:51:40.980]   as we've been kind of hoping it doesn't get out of hand?
[02:51:41.980 --> 02:51:46.980]   - Yeah, I mean, there's realists see states
[02:51:46.980 --> 02:51:49.740]   following their own interests
[02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:53.260]   and prioritizing their own security.
[02:51:53.260 --> 02:51:55.700]   And there's probably not much that could be done
[02:51:55.700 --> 02:51:59.700]   to change that, but conflict arising
[02:51:59.700 --> 02:52:03.620]   as a result of misunderstanding or mixed messages
[02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:08.180]   or misinterpretation.
[02:52:08.180 --> 02:52:10.660]   Those are things that policy makers
[02:52:10.660 --> 02:52:13.140]   probably do have some control over.
[02:52:13.140 --> 02:52:16.100]   I think that there's internal processes
[02:52:16.100 --> 02:52:17.380]   that'll work their way out
[02:52:17.380 --> 02:52:21.540]   even as opaque a place as North Korea.
[02:52:21.540 --> 02:52:24.860]   It's also the reality just as we saw
[02:52:24.860 --> 02:52:26.700]   with the divided Germanys that
[02:52:26.700 --> 02:52:32.980]   it's a precarious kind of a twinned existence
[02:52:32.980 --> 02:52:36.060]   when you have countries that are across the border
[02:52:36.060 --> 02:52:38.380]   from one another that are derived from
[02:52:38.380 --> 02:52:42.580]   what used to be a single unit that now are
[02:52:42.580 --> 02:52:45.500]   kind of a real life social science experiment
[02:52:45.500 --> 02:52:48.900]   in what kind of regime do you get with one kind of system?
[02:52:48.900 --> 02:52:51.020]   What sort of regime do you get with another kind of system?
[02:52:51.020 --> 02:52:55.980]   And that's a very unstable setup as it turns out.
[02:52:55.980 --> 02:52:59.140]   - Now let us jump continents
[02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:05.220]   and in the 20th century look to North America.
[02:53:05.580 --> 02:53:10.580]   So you also have lectured about communism in America,
[02:53:10.580 --> 02:53:12.860]   the different communist movements in America.
[02:53:12.860 --> 02:53:16.420]   It was also founded in 1919
[02:53:16.420 --> 02:53:21.420]   and evolved throughout through a couple of red scares.
[02:53:21.420 --> 02:53:24.860]   So what was the evolution of the Communist Party
[02:53:24.860 --> 02:53:27.100]   and just in general communists in America?
[02:53:27.100 --> 02:53:31.100]   - Well, it's fascinating to observe this story
[02:53:31.100 --> 02:53:34.060]   because one longstanding commonplace
[02:53:34.060 --> 02:53:38.540]   had been that socialism has less purchase
[02:53:38.540 --> 02:53:42.300]   or radical socialism in the United States
[02:53:42.300 --> 02:53:44.580]   than in European countries.
[02:53:44.580 --> 02:53:47.820]   So to the extent that that was true,
[02:53:47.820 --> 02:53:51.500]   it was an uphill battle for the communists
[02:53:51.500 --> 02:53:53.860]   to get established in the United States,
[02:53:53.860 --> 02:53:57.540]   but it makes it all the more interesting
[02:53:57.540 --> 02:54:01.740]   to follow the development of the movement.
[02:54:01.740 --> 02:54:06.740]   And there were two challenges in particular
[02:54:06.740 --> 02:54:09.780]   that played a role in shaping
[02:54:09.780 --> 02:54:12.620]   the American communist experience.
[02:54:12.620 --> 02:54:14.740]   One was the fact that to begin with,
[02:54:14.740 --> 02:54:19.580]   the party was often identified with immigrants.
[02:54:19.580 --> 02:54:26.060]   The communities that had come over across the Atlantic
[02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:29.780]   from Europe often had strong socialist contingents.
[02:54:29.780 --> 02:54:33.420]   And when this break happens within the socialist movement
[02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:37.100]   between radical socialists and more moderate socialists,
[02:54:37.100 --> 02:54:43.380]   there were fiery individuals who saw the opportunity
[02:54:43.380 --> 02:54:46.620]   to help shape the American communist movement.
[02:54:46.620 --> 02:54:50.820]   But the result was that for many American workers,
[02:54:50.820 --> 02:54:54.940]   they saw the sheer ethnic variety and difference
[02:54:54.940 --> 02:54:57.420]   of this movement as something that was unfamiliar.
[02:54:58.900 --> 02:55:02.340]   It would only be with the rise to the leadership
[02:55:02.340 --> 02:55:04.660]   of the Communist Party of Earl Browder,
[02:55:04.660 --> 02:55:09.660]   a American-born political leader with vast ambitions
[02:55:09.660 --> 02:55:13.300]   for creating an American communist movement
[02:55:13.300 --> 02:55:17.020]   that that image would start to be modified.
[02:55:17.020 --> 02:55:21.780]   Earl Browder had a meteoric rise and then fall
[02:55:21.780 --> 02:55:26.780]   over the promise he made that went by the slogan,
[02:55:27.100 --> 02:55:30.380]   "Communism is 20th century Americanism."
[02:55:30.380 --> 02:55:35.740]   The notion was that communism could find roots
[02:55:35.740 --> 02:55:39.460]   in American political discourse and experience
[02:55:39.460 --> 02:55:44.460]   where Earl Browder fell afoul of other communists
[02:55:44.460 --> 02:55:47.820]   was in his expectations during World War II
[02:55:47.820 --> 02:55:50.500]   that it might be possible for the Soviet Union
[02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:52.380]   and the United States to make
[02:55:52.380 --> 02:55:55.380]   their current cooperation permanent
[02:55:55.380 --> 02:55:57.620]   and to come to some sort of accommodation
[02:55:57.620 --> 02:56:01.260]   that would moderate their rivalry.
[02:56:01.260 --> 02:56:03.380]   As it turns out, with the dawning already
[02:56:03.380 --> 02:56:07.320]   of Cold War tensions that would later flower more fully,
[02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:11.500]   that was unacceptable and the movement divested itself
[02:56:11.500 --> 02:56:13.700]   of Earl Browder.
[02:56:13.700 --> 02:56:18.580]   Another point that shaped American perceptions
[02:56:18.580 --> 02:56:22.320]   of the communist movement in the United States
[02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:24.360]   involved issues of espionage.
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:30.320]   During the 1930s and the 1940s, American communists,
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:33.440]   not all of them obviously,
[02:56:33.440 --> 02:56:37.620]   but select members of the movement were called upon
[02:56:37.620 --> 02:56:40.560]   by Soviet intelligence to play a historical role
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:44.260]   by gathering information, winning sympathies.
[02:56:44.260 --> 02:56:48.080]   One of the most amazing books of the 20th century
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:51.280]   is the book written by Whitaker Chambers
[02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:53.760]   who had served as a Soviet spy,
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:57.040]   first a committed communist, then a Soviet spy,
[02:56:57.040 --> 02:57:01.160]   and then later a renegade from those allegiances.
[02:57:01.160 --> 02:57:05.760]   His book is entitled "Witness" published in 1952,
[02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:08.180]   and it's one of the most compelling books
[02:57:08.180 --> 02:57:11.080]   you could ever read because it's so full
[02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:15.320]   of both the unique character of the author
[02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:18.040]   in all of his idiosyncrasies
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:22.920]   and a sense of huge issues being at stake,
[02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:26.000]   ones upon which the future of humanity turns.
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:27.800]   So talk about the ethical element
[02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:29.240]   being of importance there.
[02:57:29.240 --> 02:57:36.120]   Through the apparatus of the state,
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:40.120]   the Soviets managed to infiltrate spies
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:43.200]   into America's military
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:47.080]   as well as government institutions.
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:53.000]   One great irony is that when Senator McCarthy
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:57.620]   in the '50s made vast claims
[02:57:57.620 --> 02:58:02.620]   about communist infiltration of the government apparatus,
[02:58:02.620 --> 02:58:07.840]   claims that he was unable to substantiate with details,
[02:58:07.840 --> 02:58:13.280]   that reality had actually been closer
[02:58:13.280 --> 02:58:16.800]   to the reality of the 1930s and the 1940s
[02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:18.520]   than his own time.
[02:58:18.520 --> 02:58:21.680]   But the association of American communists
[02:58:21.680 --> 02:58:24.760]   with the foreign power of the Soviet Union
[02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:29.620]   and ultimately an adherence to its interests
[02:58:29.620 --> 02:58:33.920]   did a lot to undermine any kind of hearing
[02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:36.120]   for American communists.
[02:58:36.120 --> 02:58:37.200]   An example, of course,
[02:58:37.200 --> 02:58:41.760]   was the notorious Nazi-Soviet pact in 1939.
[02:58:41.760 --> 02:58:45.800]   The American communist movement found itself forced
[02:58:45.800 --> 02:58:48.640]   to turn on a dime in its propaganda.
[02:58:48.640 --> 02:58:52.880]   Before the Nazi-Soviet pact of August 1939,
[02:58:52.880 --> 02:58:54.640]   they had denounced Nazi Germany
[02:58:54.640 --> 02:58:57.740]   as the greatest threat to world peace.
[02:58:57.740 --> 02:58:59.920]   Just after the signing of the pact,
[02:58:59.920 --> 02:59:04.680]   they had to proclaim that this was a great win for peace
[02:59:04.680 --> 02:59:06.640]   and for human harmony
[02:59:06.640 --> 02:59:11.080]   and to completely change
[02:59:11.080 --> 02:59:15.560]   their earlier relationship of being mortal enemies
[02:59:15.560 --> 02:59:17.520]   with Nazi Germany.
[02:59:17.520 --> 02:59:19.120]   There were many American communists
[02:59:19.120 --> 02:59:20.520]   who couldn't stomach this
[02:59:20.520 --> 02:59:22.840]   and who in disillusionment
[02:59:22.840 --> 02:59:26.180]   simply quit their party memberships or drifted away.
[02:59:26.180 --> 02:59:31.240]   But it's a fascinating story of the ups and downs
[02:59:31.240 --> 02:59:34.560]   of a political movement with radical ambitions
[02:59:34.560 --> 02:59:37.240]   in American political history.
[02:59:37.240 --> 02:59:42.240]   - Yeah, the Cold War and the extensive levels of espionage
[02:59:42.240 --> 02:59:46.960]   sort of created, combined with Hollywood,
[02:59:46.960 --> 02:59:51.680]   created a basically firmly solidified communism
[02:59:51.680 --> 02:59:54.180]   as the enemy of the American ideal.
[02:59:54.180 --> 02:59:57.320]   It was sort of embodied.
[02:59:57.320 --> 02:59:59.040]   And not even the economic policies
[02:59:59.040 --> 03:00:02.280]   of the political policies of communism,
[03:00:02.280 --> 03:00:06.380]   but like the word and the color red
[03:00:06.380 --> 03:00:08.040]   with a hammer and sickle.
[03:00:08.040 --> 03:00:10.840]   You know, "Rocky IV," one of my favorite movies.
[03:00:10.840 --> 03:00:12.160]   - Well, that's canonical, right?
[03:00:12.160 --> 03:00:15.720]   - Yeah, I mean, it is a bit of a meme,
[03:00:15.720 --> 03:00:18.480]   but meme becomes reality
[03:00:18.480 --> 03:00:21.240]   and then enters politics
[03:00:21.240 --> 03:00:25.440]   and is used by politicians to do all kinds of name calling.
[03:00:25.440 --> 03:00:31.480]   You have spoken eloquently about modern Russia
[03:00:33.820 --> 03:00:37.300]   and modern Ukraine and modern Eastern Europe.
[03:00:37.300 --> 03:00:43.400]   So how did Russia evolve after Stalin
[03:00:43.400 --> 03:00:45.740]   and after the collapse of the Soviet Union?
[03:00:45.740 --> 03:00:50.120]   - Well, I think the short answer is
[03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:52.800]   without a full historical reckoning
[03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:57.040]   that would have been healthy about the recent past,
[03:00:57.040 --> 03:00:58.800]   in ways that's not very surprising
[03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:02.640]   because given the economic misery of dislocations
[03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:04.840]   and the cumulative damage
[03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:08.940]   of all of those previous decades of this experiment,
[03:01:08.940 --> 03:01:11.080]   it left precious little patience
[03:01:11.080 --> 03:01:15.080]   or leisure or surplus for introspection.
[03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:21.080]   But after an initial period of great interest
[03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:28.000]   in understanding the full measure
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:32.640]   of what Russia and other parts of the Soviet Union
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:36.600]   had undergone in this first initial explosion
[03:01:36.600 --> 03:01:41.600]   of journalism and of reporting and investigations,
[03:01:41.600 --> 03:01:43.880]   historical investigations with new sources,
[03:01:43.880 --> 03:01:48.840]   after an initial period marked by such interest,
[03:01:48.840 --> 03:01:53.840]   people instead retreated into the here and now and the today.
[03:01:56.160 --> 03:01:58.000]   And the result is that
[03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:04.240]   there's been less than would be healthy
[03:02:04.240 --> 03:02:07.900]   of a taking stock, a reckoning,
[03:02:07.900 --> 03:02:12.520]   even an assigning of responsibility
[03:02:12.520 --> 03:02:16.180]   for those things that were experienced in the past.
[03:02:16.180 --> 03:02:20.120]   No Nuremberg trial took place
[03:02:20.120 --> 03:02:24.400]   in order to hold responsible those who had repressed others
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:28.440]   in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[03:02:28.440 --> 03:02:31.960]   In other ex-communist countries,
[03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:34.280]   there was also precious little in the way
[03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:36.240]   of legal proceedings
[03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:38.240]   that would have established responsibility.
[03:02:38.240 --> 03:02:41.500]   Keep in mind, the Nuremberg trials
[03:02:41.500 --> 03:02:42.960]   had as one of their goals,
[03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:45.220]   a very important one as it turns out,
[03:02:45.220 --> 03:02:47.560]   not even individual verdicts
[03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:50.940]   for individual people found guilty,
[03:02:50.940 --> 03:02:55.220]   but to collect and publicize information,
[03:02:55.220 --> 03:02:57.300]   to create knowledge and transparency
[03:02:57.300 --> 03:02:59.660]   about what the reality had been in the past.
[03:02:59.660 --> 03:03:03.940]   In the case of the former Soviet Union,
[03:03:03.940 --> 03:03:06.260]   in the case of Russia today,
[03:03:06.260 --> 03:03:10.420]   instead of a clear-eyed recognition
[03:03:10.420 --> 03:03:14.060]   of the vast nature of what it all cost,
[03:03:14.060 --> 03:03:17.040]   Putin, upon replacing Yeltsin,
[03:03:17.940 --> 03:03:21.300]   was in a position to instead traffic
[03:03:21.300 --> 03:03:24.660]   in the most varied, eclectic,
[03:03:24.660 --> 03:03:28.900]   and often mutually contradictory historical memories
[03:03:28.900 --> 03:03:31.460]   or packages of memories.
[03:03:31.460 --> 03:03:35.540]   So on the one hand in Putin's Russia,
[03:03:35.540 --> 03:03:41.500]   the Tsars are rehabilitated as heroes of Russian statehood.
[03:03:41.500 --> 03:03:46.300]   Putin sees Lenin in a negative light
[03:03:46.300 --> 03:03:49.660]   because Lenin, by producing federalism
[03:03:49.660 --> 03:03:51.340]   as a model for the Soviet Union,
[03:03:51.340 --> 03:03:55.140]   laid a time bomb at the base of that state
[03:03:55.140 --> 03:03:59.180]   that eventually smashed it into many constituent parts
[03:03:59.180 --> 03:04:03.120]   as nations regained their independence,
[03:04:03.120 --> 03:04:05.820]   while Stalin, it's acknowledged,
[03:04:05.820 --> 03:04:08.980]   exacted a dreadful toll,
[03:04:08.980 --> 03:04:10.540]   but also was effective
[03:04:10.540 --> 03:04:12.780]   as a representative of Russian statehood.
[03:04:14.860 --> 03:04:18.060]   This produced where we are today.
[03:04:18.060 --> 03:04:22.860]   It's a commonplace that echoed by many
[03:04:22.860 --> 03:04:27.020]   that Russia, without Ukraine,
[03:04:27.020 --> 03:04:30.300]   is a nation-state or could be a nation-state.
[03:04:30.300 --> 03:04:34.500]   Russia, with Ukraine, has to be an empire.
[03:04:34.500 --> 03:04:37.500]   And Putin, who is not really seeking
[03:04:37.500 --> 03:04:40.140]   a revival of Stalin's rule,
[03:04:40.140 --> 03:04:44.420]   but still is nostalgic about earlier forms
[03:04:44.420 --> 03:04:49.420]   of greatness and of the strength of Russian statehood
[03:04:49.420 --> 03:04:52.380]   to the exclusion of other values,
[03:04:52.380 --> 03:04:56.400]   has undertaken a course of aggression
[03:04:56.400 --> 03:04:59.460]   that has produced results quite different
[03:04:59.460 --> 03:05:01.660]   from what he likely expected.
[03:05:01.660 --> 03:05:04.820]   And I think that timing is crucial here.
[03:05:04.820 --> 03:05:07.340]   It's fascinating to try to imagine
[03:05:07.340 --> 03:05:12.340]   what if this attempt to re-digest Ukraine
[03:05:13.860 --> 03:05:18.180]   into an expanded Russian imperial territory
[03:05:18.180 --> 03:05:19.760]   had taken place earlier.
[03:05:19.760 --> 03:05:22.460]   I think that the arrival on the scene
[03:05:22.460 --> 03:05:26.020]   of a new generation of Ukrainians
[03:05:26.020 --> 03:05:30.220]   has produced a very different dynamic
[03:05:30.220 --> 03:05:34.060]   and a disinclination for any kind of nostalgia
[03:05:34.060 --> 03:05:38.900]   for the past, packaged however it might be,
[03:05:38.900 --> 03:05:43.340]   and however nostalgic it might be made to appear.
[03:05:43.340 --> 03:05:48.000]   And there, I think that Putin's expectations
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:53.000]   in the invasion of 2022 were entirely overturned.
[03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:57.740]   His expectation was that Ukraine would be divided
[03:05:57.740 --> 03:06:02.020]   on this score and that some significant portion
[03:06:02.020 --> 03:06:06.260]   of Ukrainians would welcome the advance of Russian forces.
[03:06:06.260 --> 03:06:10.660]   And instead, there has been the most amazing
[03:06:10.660 --> 03:06:14.020]   and surprising heroic resistance
[03:06:14.020 --> 03:06:15.900]   that continues to this day.
[03:06:15.900 --> 03:06:18.700]   - And it's interesting to consider timing
[03:06:18.700 --> 03:06:21.500]   and also individual leaders.
[03:06:21.500 --> 03:06:25.020]   Zelensky, you can imagine all kinds of other figures
[03:06:25.020 --> 03:06:28.860]   that would've folded much easier.
[03:06:28.860 --> 03:06:32.420]   And Zelensky, I think, surprised a lot of the world
[03:06:32.420 --> 03:06:34.540]   by somehow, you know, this comedian,
[03:06:34.540 --> 03:06:40.100]   somehow becoming a, essentially,
[03:06:40.100 --> 03:06:41.860]   an effective war president.
[03:06:41.860 --> 03:06:47.540]   So, you know, put that in the bin
[03:06:47.540 --> 03:06:52.260]   of singular figures that define history.
[03:06:52.260 --> 03:06:54.380]   - That surprises, yeah, yeah.
[03:06:54.380 --> 03:06:56.940]   - How do you hope the war in Ukraine ends?
[03:06:56.940 --> 03:06:59.700]   - I'm very pessimistic on this score, actually,
[03:06:59.700 --> 03:07:02.220]   and for the reasons we just talked about,
[03:07:02.220 --> 03:07:07.220]   about how these things escape human management
[03:07:07.900 --> 03:07:09.580]   or even rationality.
[03:07:09.580 --> 03:07:14.820]   I think that war takes on a life of its own
[03:07:14.820 --> 03:07:20.820]   as accumulated suffering actually eliminates
[03:07:20.820 --> 03:07:25.540]   possible compromises or settlements
[03:07:25.540 --> 03:07:28.380]   that one might talk about in the abstract.
[03:07:28.380 --> 03:07:34.300]   I think that it's one thing for people far away
[03:07:36.540 --> 03:07:40.540]   to propose trades of territory
[03:07:40.540 --> 03:07:45.540]   or complicated guarantees
[03:07:45.540 --> 03:07:51.620]   or arrangements that sound very good in the abstract
[03:07:51.620 --> 03:07:55.340]   and that will just be refused by people
[03:07:55.340 --> 03:07:56.900]   who have actually experienced
[03:07:56.900 --> 03:07:59.420]   what the war has been like in person
[03:07:59.420 --> 03:08:02.860]   and what it has meant to them and their families
[03:08:02.860 --> 03:08:05.940]   and everyone they know in terms of lives destroyed.
[03:08:05.940 --> 03:08:11.500]   I think that peacemaking is going to face
[03:08:11.500 --> 03:08:15.740]   a very daunting task here given all that's accumulated.
[03:08:15.740 --> 03:08:19.300]   And I think in particular, you know,
[03:08:19.300 --> 03:08:21.740]   just from the last days of the launching
[03:08:21.740 --> 03:08:25.460]   of missile attacks against indiscriminate
[03:08:25.460 --> 03:08:30.460]   or civilian targets, that's not easy to turn the corner on.
[03:08:31.180 --> 03:08:32.820]   - So let me ask a political question.
[03:08:32.820 --> 03:08:35.980]   I recently talked to Donald Trump and he said,
[03:08:35.980 --> 03:08:40.460]   if he is elected, before he is sworn into office,
[03:08:40.460 --> 03:08:43.180]   he will have a peace deal.
[03:08:43.180 --> 03:08:46.540]   What would a peace deal like that look like?
[03:08:46.540 --> 03:08:49.300]   And is it even possible, do you think?
[03:08:49.300 --> 03:08:52.660]   So we should mention that Russia has captured
[03:08:52.660 --> 03:08:55.820]   four regions of Ukraine, now Donetsk, Luhansk,
[03:08:55.820 --> 03:08:57.180]   Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.
[03:08:57.180 --> 03:09:00.820]   Also Ukraine captured a part of Kursk region
[03:09:00.820 --> 03:09:02.060]   and within Russia.
[03:09:02.060 --> 03:09:05.100]   So just like you mentioned, territory is on the table.
[03:09:05.100 --> 03:09:08.720]   You know, NATO, European Union is on the table.
[03:09:08.720 --> 03:09:14.740]   Also funding and military help from the United States
[03:09:14.740 --> 03:09:16.640]   directly to Ukraine is on the table.
[03:09:16.640 --> 03:09:20.460]   Do you think it's possible to have a fair deal
[03:09:20.460 --> 03:09:23.900]   that from people like you said, far away,
[03:09:23.900 --> 03:09:27.300]   where both people walk away, Zelensky and Putin,
[03:09:27.300 --> 03:09:32.300]   unhappy but equally unhappy and peace is negotiated?
[03:09:32.300 --> 03:09:37.380]   - Equally unhappy is a very hard balance to strike,
[03:09:37.380 --> 03:09:38.220]   probably.
[03:09:38.220 --> 03:09:43.740]   I think my concern is about the part of the equation
[03:09:43.740 --> 03:09:46.460]   that involves people just being desperately unhappy,
[03:09:46.460 --> 03:09:50.380]   laying the foundations for more trouble to come.
[03:09:50.380 --> 03:09:52.820]   I couldn't imagine what that looks like,
[03:09:52.820 --> 03:09:54.740]   but that's, once again, these are things
[03:09:54.740 --> 03:09:59.740]   that escape human control in the details.
[03:09:59.740 --> 03:10:03.080]   - So laying the foundation for worse things to come.
[03:10:03.080 --> 03:10:06.920]   So it's possible you have a ceasefire
[03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:11.680]   that lays the foundation for a worse war
[03:10:11.680 --> 03:10:16.680]   and suffering in a year, in five years, in 10 years.
[03:10:16.680 --> 03:10:19.820]   - Well, in a way, we may already be there
[03:10:19.820 --> 03:10:23.720]   because ratifying the use of force to change borders
[03:10:23.720 --> 03:10:28.720]   in Europe was a taboo since 1945, and now look where we are.
[03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:32.300]   If that is validated,
[03:10:32.300 --> 03:10:37.300]   then it sets up incentives for more of the same.
[03:10:37.300 --> 03:10:41.020]   - If you look at the 20th century,
[03:10:41.020 --> 03:10:43.420]   it's what we've been talking about,
[03:10:43.420 --> 03:10:48.420]   with horrendous global wars that happened then,
[03:10:48.420 --> 03:10:49.820]   and you look at now,
[03:10:51.260 --> 03:10:54.480]   and it feels like, just living in the moment,
[03:10:54.480 --> 03:10:59.480]   with the war in Ukraine breaking the contract
[03:10:59.480 --> 03:11:03.660]   of you're not supposed to do territorial conquest anymore
[03:11:03.660 --> 03:11:05.520]   in the 21st century,
[03:11:05.520 --> 03:11:10.520]   that then the just intensity of hatred
[03:11:10.520 --> 03:11:15.700]   and military tension in the Middle East
[03:11:15.700 --> 03:11:19.600]   with Israel, Iran, Palestine,
[03:11:19.600 --> 03:11:24.600]   just building, and then China, calmly,
[03:11:24.600 --> 03:11:29.680]   but with a big stick, talking about Taiwan.
[03:11:29.680 --> 03:11:32.320]   Do you think a big conflict may be on the way?
[03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:36.840]   Do you think it's possible that another global war happens
[03:11:36.840 --> 03:11:38.740]   in the 21st century?
[03:11:38.740 --> 03:11:45.160]   - I hope not, but I think so many predictions
[03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:49.060]   reach their expiration dates and get invalidated.
[03:11:50.060 --> 03:11:55.060]   Obviously we're confronting a dire situation in the present.
[03:11:55.060 --> 03:11:59.980]   - So as a historian, let me ask you for advice.
[03:11:59.980 --> 03:12:04.180]   What advice would you give on interviewing world leaders,
[03:12:04.180 --> 03:12:08.500]   whether it's people who are no longer here,
[03:12:08.500 --> 03:12:10.060]   some of the people we've been talking about,
[03:12:10.060 --> 03:12:13.540]   Hitler, Stalin, Mao, or people that are still here,
[03:12:13.540 --> 03:12:18.220]   Putin, Zelensky, Trump, Kamala Harris, Netanyahu,
[03:12:18.220 --> 03:12:22.500]   Xi Jinping, as a historian,
[03:12:22.500 --> 03:12:24.780]   is it possible to have an interesting conversation?
[03:12:24.780 --> 03:12:26.100]   Maybe as a thought experiment,
[03:12:26.100 --> 03:12:29.060]   what kind of conversation would you like to have
[03:12:29.060 --> 03:12:33.180]   with Hitler in the 1930s or Stalin in the 1920s?
[03:12:33.180 --> 03:12:35.140]   - Well, first of all, I mean, the answer's very clear.
[03:12:35.140 --> 03:12:37.740]   I would never presume to advise you
[03:12:37.740 --> 03:12:42.060]   about interviewing world leaders and prominent people
[03:12:42.060 --> 03:12:45.180]   because the roster that you've accumulated
[03:12:45.180 --> 03:12:46.700]   is just astonishing.
[03:12:46.700 --> 03:12:49.780]   But I know what I might aim for.
[03:12:49.780 --> 03:12:54.780]   And that is, I think in historical analysis,
[03:12:54.780 --> 03:12:59.260]   in trying to understand the role of a particular leader,
[03:12:59.260 --> 03:13:02.500]   the more one understands about their prior background
[03:13:02.500 --> 03:13:06.460]   and formative influences, the better a fix
[03:13:06.460 --> 03:13:08.300]   I think one gets on the question
[03:13:08.300 --> 03:13:10.780]   of what are their expectations?
[03:13:10.780 --> 03:13:14.580]   What is the, in German, there's a beautiful word for this.
[03:13:14.580 --> 03:13:16.940]   The Germans managed to mash together several words
[03:13:16.940 --> 03:13:18.780]   into one even better word.
[03:13:18.780 --> 03:13:21.500]   And in German, it's erwartungshorizont,
[03:13:21.500 --> 03:13:24.340]   the horizon of expectation.
[03:13:24.340 --> 03:13:29.340]   So in the case of figures like Churchill or Hitler,
[03:13:29.340 --> 03:13:32.180]   their experience of World War I
[03:13:32.180 --> 03:13:35.660]   shaped their actions in World War II.
[03:13:35.660 --> 03:13:41.060]   Their values were shaped in their childhood.
[03:13:42.220 --> 03:13:47.220]   Is there a way of engaging with someone you're interviewing,
[03:13:47.220 --> 03:13:53.820]   even obliquely, that gives a view in on their sense
[03:13:53.820 --> 03:13:57.220]   of what the future might hold?
[03:13:57.220 --> 03:14:00.420]   And I mean that, obviously, such people are expert
[03:14:00.420 --> 03:14:03.900]   at being guarded and not being pinned down,
[03:14:03.900 --> 03:14:06.300]   but the categories in which they're thinking,
[03:14:06.300 --> 03:14:11.180]   a sense of what their own ethical grounding might be
[03:14:11.180 --> 03:14:14.580]   or their ethical code that gives hints to their behavior.
[03:14:14.580 --> 03:14:17.660]   It gets said, and again, it's a cliche 'cause it's true,
[03:14:17.660 --> 03:14:20.260]   that one of the best measures of a person,
[03:14:20.260 --> 03:14:24.300]   especially a leader, is how they treat people
[03:14:24.300 --> 03:14:26.340]   from whom they don't expect anything.
[03:14:26.340 --> 03:14:29.380]   Are they condescending?
[03:14:29.380 --> 03:14:33.780]   Are they, on the contrary, fundamentally interested
[03:14:33.780 --> 03:14:37.300]   in another person, even if that person can't help them
[03:14:37.300 --> 03:14:38.820]   or be used in some way?
[03:14:40.220 --> 03:14:43.700]   Speaking of prominent world leaders to interview,
[03:14:43.700 --> 03:14:45.460]   there's Napoleon.
[03:14:45.460 --> 03:14:48.100]   Napoleon, psychologically, must have been
[03:14:48.100 --> 03:14:52.420]   a quite amazing person to make a bid for mastery of Europe
[03:14:52.420 --> 03:14:55.500]   and then already thinking about the mastery of the world.
[03:14:55.500 --> 03:14:58.820]   But contemporaries who met Napoleon
[03:14:58.820 --> 03:15:01.700]   said that it was very disturbing to talk with him
[03:15:01.700 --> 03:15:05.540]   because meeting with him one-on-one
[03:15:05.540 --> 03:15:08.560]   revealed that he could talk to you
[03:15:08.560 --> 03:15:11.660]   but look like he was looking right through you,
[03:15:11.660 --> 03:15:13.820]   as if you were not fully real.
[03:15:13.820 --> 03:15:18.820]   You were more in the nature of a character on a chessboard.
[03:15:18.820 --> 03:15:22.140]   And for that reason, some of them called Napoleon
[03:15:22.140 --> 03:15:24.560]   the master of the sightless stare.
[03:15:24.560 --> 03:15:26.660]   So if you're talking with a world leader
[03:15:26.660 --> 03:15:28.380]   and he or she has a sightless stare,
[03:15:28.380 --> 03:15:30.340]   that's probably a bad sign.
[03:15:30.340 --> 03:15:34.340]   But there might be other inadvertent clues or hints
[03:15:34.340 --> 03:15:39.340]   about the moral compass or the future expectations
[03:15:39.340 --> 03:15:41.960]   of a leader that emerge
[03:15:41.960 --> 03:15:44.280]   in one of your wonderful conversations.
[03:15:44.280 --> 03:15:46.860]   - Yeah, you put it brilliantly in several ways,
[03:15:46.860 --> 03:15:51.860]   but the moral compass, sneaking up to the full nuance
[03:15:51.860 --> 03:15:54.000]   and complexity of the moral compass.
[03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:56.400]   And one of the ways of doing that
[03:15:56.400 --> 03:15:59.920]   is looking at the various horizons in time
[03:15:59.920 --> 03:16:02.160]   about their vision of the future.
[03:16:02.160 --> 03:16:05.580]   I imagine it's possible to get Hitler
[03:16:05.580 --> 03:16:07.700]   to talk about the future of the Third Reich
[03:16:07.700 --> 03:16:13.380]   and to see in ways like what he actually envisions that as
[03:16:13.380 --> 03:16:14.840]   and similar with Stalin.
[03:16:14.840 --> 03:16:19.220]   But of course, funny enough,
[03:16:19.220 --> 03:16:22.300]   I believe those leaders would be easier to talk to
[03:16:22.300 --> 03:16:24.420]   because there's nothing to be afraid of
[03:16:24.420 --> 03:16:26.320]   in terms of political competition.
[03:16:26.320 --> 03:16:30.500]   Modern leaders are a little bit more guarded
[03:16:30.500 --> 03:16:32.300]   because they have to,
[03:16:32.300 --> 03:16:37.280]   they have opposition often to contend with.
[03:16:37.280 --> 03:16:38.120]   - And constituencies.
[03:16:38.120 --> 03:16:39.980]   - And constituencies.
[03:16:39.980 --> 03:16:43.700]   You did a lot of amazing courses,
[03:16:43.700 --> 03:16:46.340]   including four, the great courses.
[03:16:46.340 --> 03:16:50.300]   On the topic of communism, you just finished the third.
[03:16:50.300 --> 03:16:54.840]   So you did a series of lectures on the rise of communism,
[03:16:54.840 --> 03:16:57.580]   then communism and power,
[03:16:57.580 --> 03:17:00.380]   and then decline and fall.
[03:17:00.380 --> 03:17:01.860]   - Right of communism, decline of communism.
[03:17:01.860 --> 03:17:06.180]   - So when I was sort of listening to these lectures,
[03:17:06.180 --> 03:17:08.500]   I can't possibly imagine the amount of work
[03:17:08.500 --> 03:17:11.620]   that went into it.
[03:17:11.620 --> 03:17:16.620]   Can you just speak wisely as what was that journey like
[03:17:16.620 --> 03:17:18.340]   of taking everything you know,
[03:17:18.340 --> 03:17:20.900]   your expertise on Eastern Europe,
[03:17:20.900 --> 03:17:25.220]   but just bringing your lens, your wisdom,
[03:17:25.220 --> 03:17:27.160]   your focus onto this topic
[03:17:27.160 --> 03:17:29.900]   and what it takes to actually bring it to life?
[03:17:29.900 --> 03:17:32.100]   - Well, journey is probably just the right word
[03:17:32.100 --> 03:17:36.940]   because it's this week that the third of that trilogy,
[03:17:36.940 --> 03:17:39.600]   decline of communism is being released.
[03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:43.340]   And it felt like something that I very much wanted to do
[03:17:43.340 --> 03:17:48.340]   because the history that's narrated there
[03:17:48.340 --> 03:17:52.980]   is one that is so compelling and often so tragic
[03:17:52.980 --> 03:17:55.120]   that it needs to be shared.
[03:17:55.120 --> 03:18:00.620]   The vast amount of material that one can include
[03:18:00.620 --> 03:18:02.460]   is probably dwarfed by the amount
[03:18:02.460 --> 03:18:05.020]   that actually ends up on the cutting room floor.
[03:18:05.020 --> 03:18:07.720]   One could probably do an entire lecture course
[03:18:07.720 --> 03:18:10.740]   on every single one of those lecture topics
[03:18:10.740 --> 03:18:12.380]   that got broached.
[03:18:12.380 --> 03:18:15.440]   But one of the great satisfactions
[03:18:15.440 --> 03:18:18.700]   of putting together a course like this
[03:18:18.700 --> 03:18:22.420]   is also being able to give further suggestions for study
[03:18:22.420 --> 03:18:24.420]   to the listeners.
[03:18:24.420 --> 03:18:29.420]   And in some cases, to introduce them to neglected classics
[03:18:29.420 --> 03:18:33.580]   or books that make you want to grab somebody by the lapels
[03:18:33.580 --> 03:18:36.420]   and say, "You've got to read this."
[03:18:36.420 --> 03:18:39.340]   There's probably few things that are as exciting
[03:18:39.340 --> 03:18:44.340]   as a really keen and targeted reading recommendation.
[03:18:44.340 --> 03:18:47.620]   In addition, I've also done other courses
[03:18:47.620 --> 03:18:50.880]   on the history of World War I,
[03:18:50.880 --> 03:18:55.880]   on the diplomatic history of Europe from 1500 to the present,
[03:18:55.880 --> 03:18:58.980]   a course on the history of Eastern Europe,
[03:18:58.980 --> 03:19:02.120]   and also a course on dictatorships
[03:19:02.120 --> 03:19:03.740]   called "Utopia and Terror,"
[03:19:03.740 --> 03:19:06.420]   and then also a course on explorers
[03:19:06.420 --> 03:19:09.700]   and a course on turning points in modern history.
[03:19:09.700 --> 03:19:13.460]   And every single one of those is so rewarding
[03:19:13.460 --> 03:19:16.260]   because you learn so much in the process,
[03:19:16.260 --> 03:19:17.740]   and it's really fantastic.
[03:19:17.740 --> 03:19:19.740]   - And I should highly recommend
[03:19:19.740 --> 03:19:22.220]   that people sign up to the...
[03:19:22.220 --> 03:19:23.520]   First of all, this is the great courses
[03:19:23.520 --> 03:19:25.060]   where you can buy the courses individually,
[03:19:25.060 --> 03:19:28.460]   but I recommend people sign up for Great Courses Plus,
[03:19:28.460 --> 03:19:30.500]   which I think is like a monthly membership
[03:19:30.500 --> 03:19:34.580]   where you get access to all these courses,
[03:19:34.580 --> 03:19:35.800]   and they're just incredible.
[03:19:35.800 --> 03:19:39.240]   And I recommend people watch all of yours.
[03:19:39.240 --> 03:19:43.020]   Since you mentioned books, this is an impossible question,
[03:19:43.020 --> 03:19:44.340]   and I apologize ahead of time,
[03:19:44.340 --> 03:19:46.620]   but is there books you can recommend
[03:19:46.620 --> 03:19:49.400]   just in your own life that you've enjoyed,
[03:19:49.400 --> 03:19:55.580]   whether really small or some obvious recommendations
[03:19:55.580 --> 03:19:59.820]   that you recommend people read?
[03:19:59.820 --> 03:20:03.180]   It is a bit like asking, "What's your favorite band?"
[03:20:03.180 --> 03:20:04.100]   That kind of thing. - That's right, that's right.
[03:20:04.100 --> 03:20:07.060]   Well, would a book that got turned into a movie
[03:20:07.060 --> 03:20:09.300]   be acceptable as well?
[03:20:09.300 --> 03:20:10.140]   - Yes. (laughs)
[03:20:10.140 --> 03:20:14.980]   - So in that case, all of us reflect on our own childhoods,
[03:20:14.980 --> 03:20:19.980]   and that magical moment of reading a book
[03:20:19.980 --> 03:20:23.740]   or seeing a movie that really got you launched
[03:20:23.740 --> 03:20:25.940]   on some particular set of things
[03:20:25.940 --> 03:20:27.320]   that you're gonna find fascinating
[03:20:27.320 --> 03:20:28.500]   for the rest of your life.
[03:20:28.500 --> 03:20:30.920]   And there's a direct line to the topics
[03:20:30.920 --> 03:20:32.620]   we were talking about today
[03:20:32.620 --> 03:20:36.660]   from myself in the Chicagoland area as a kid
[03:20:36.660 --> 03:20:39.860]   seeing the film of "Dr. Zhivago,"
[03:20:39.860 --> 03:20:42.500]   and then later reading the novel
[03:20:42.500 --> 03:20:44.660]   on which it was based by Postanak.
[03:20:44.660 --> 03:20:47.900]   And even though the film had to be filmed
[03:20:47.900 --> 03:20:49.420]   on location in Spain,
[03:20:49.420 --> 03:20:52.100]   pretending to be revolutionary Russia,
[03:20:52.100 --> 03:20:56.660]   it was magical for the sheer sweep
[03:20:56.660 --> 03:21:01.660]   and tragedy and human resilience that it showed.
[03:21:01.660 --> 03:21:05.900]   The very way in which a work of literature
[03:21:05.900 --> 03:21:09.360]   or of cinematography could capture so much,
[03:21:09.360 --> 03:21:14.420]   still, I'm still amazed by that.
[03:21:14.420 --> 03:21:15.860]   And then there's also,
[03:21:15.860 --> 03:21:19.920]   in the spirit of recommending neglected classics,
[03:21:19.920 --> 03:21:21.700]   my favorite author.
[03:21:21.700 --> 03:21:26.500]   My favorite author is now a late Canadian author
[03:21:26.500 --> 03:21:29.220]   by the name of Robertson Davies,
[03:21:29.220 --> 03:21:34.220]   who wrote novel after novel
[03:21:34.220 --> 03:21:41.460]   in a mode that probably would get called magical realism,
[03:21:41.460 --> 03:21:43.380]   but is so much more.
[03:21:43.380 --> 03:21:47.100]   Robertson Davies was heavily influenced
[03:21:47.100 --> 03:21:51.620]   by Carl Jung and Jungian philosophy,
[03:21:51.620 --> 03:21:54.360]   but in literary form,
[03:21:54.360 --> 03:21:56.420]   he managed to create stories
[03:21:56.420 --> 03:22:00.560]   that blend the mythical, the mystical,
[03:22:00.560 --> 03:22:03.300]   and the brutally real
[03:22:03.300 --> 03:22:07.380]   to paint a picture of Canada as he knew it,
[03:22:07.380 --> 03:22:08.900]   Europe as he knew it,
[03:22:08.900 --> 03:22:10.580]   and the world as he knew it.
[03:22:10.580 --> 03:22:15.180]   And he's most famous probably for "The Depthford Trilogy,"
[03:22:15.180 --> 03:22:18.940]   three novels in a series that are linked,
[03:22:18.940 --> 03:22:20.700]   and they're just masterful,
[03:22:20.700 --> 03:22:22.340]   if only there were more books like that.
[03:22:22.340 --> 03:22:25.660]   - "The Depthford Trilogy," "Fifth Business,"
[03:22:25.660 --> 03:22:29.260]   "The Emanticore," "World of Wonders,"
[03:22:29.260 --> 03:22:30.980]   and you got a really nice beard.
[03:22:30.980 --> 03:22:32.460]   - Yes, it was an amazing beard.
[03:22:32.460 --> 03:22:35.700]   Very 19th century.
[03:22:35.700 --> 03:22:37.240]   - Okay, beautiful.
[03:22:38.540 --> 03:22:43.540]   What advice would you give to young people today
[03:22:43.540 --> 03:22:47.180]   that have just listened to us talk about the 20th century
[03:22:47.180 --> 03:22:49.960]   and the terrifying prospects of ideals
[03:22:49.960 --> 03:22:51.700]   implemented into reality?
[03:22:51.700 --> 03:22:53.700]   And by the way, many of the revolutions
[03:22:53.700 --> 03:22:58.700]   are carried out by young people.
[03:22:58.700 --> 03:23:02.480]   And so the good and the bad and the ugly
[03:23:02.480 --> 03:23:04.220]   is thanks to the young people.
[03:23:04.220 --> 03:23:05.540]   So the young people listening today,
[03:23:05.540 --> 03:23:07.140]   what advice would you give them?
[03:23:07.140 --> 03:23:08.440]   - Well, it comes down to one word,
[03:23:08.440 --> 03:23:10.120]   and that one word is "read."
[03:23:10.120 --> 03:23:13.620]   As a college teacher,
[03:23:13.620 --> 03:23:17.560]   I'm concerned about what I'm seeing unfolding before us,
[03:23:17.560 --> 03:23:20.700]   which is classes, not my classes,
[03:23:20.700 --> 03:23:25.700]   but classes in which students are asked to read very little,
[03:23:25.700 --> 03:23:29.500]   or maybe in some cases, not at all,
[03:23:29.500 --> 03:23:33.200]   or snippets that they are provided digitally.
[03:23:33.200 --> 03:23:37.880]   Those have their place and can be valuable,
[03:23:37.880 --> 03:23:40.780]   but the task of sitting down with a book
[03:23:40.780 --> 03:23:42.320]   and absorbing its message,
[03:23:42.320 --> 03:23:43.940]   not agreeing with it necessarily,
[03:23:43.940 --> 03:23:46.420]   but taking in the implications,
[03:23:46.420 --> 03:23:49.940]   learning how to think within the categories
[03:23:49.940 --> 03:23:54.420]   and the values of the author
[03:23:54.420 --> 03:23:58.220]   is going to be irreplaceable.
[03:23:58.220 --> 03:24:03.220]   And my anxiety is that with college bookstores
[03:24:03.840 --> 03:24:08.840]   now moving entirely to the paperless format,
[03:24:08.840 --> 03:24:12.620]   it changes how people interact with texts.
[03:24:12.620 --> 03:24:15.300]   And if the result is not a renaissance
[03:24:15.300 --> 03:24:18.500]   and a resurgence of reading, but less reading,
[03:24:18.500 --> 03:24:19.660]   that will be dreadful
[03:24:19.660 --> 03:24:21.540]   because the experience of thinking your way
[03:24:21.540 --> 03:24:26.540]   into other people's minds that sustained reading offers
[03:24:26.540 --> 03:24:31.700]   is so crucial to human empathy,
[03:24:31.700 --> 03:24:35.600]   a broadening of your own sensibilities of what's possible,
[03:24:35.600 --> 03:24:38.720]   what's in the full range of being human,
[03:24:38.720 --> 03:24:40.320]   and then what's best.
[03:24:40.320 --> 03:24:42.760]   What are the best models for what has been thought
[03:24:42.760 --> 03:24:46.080]   and felt and how people have acted?
[03:24:46.080 --> 03:24:50.040]   Otherwise, we fall prey to manipulators
[03:24:50.040 --> 03:24:53.760]   and the ability of artificial intelligence
[03:24:53.760 --> 03:24:57.440]   to give us versions of realities that never existed
[03:24:57.440 --> 03:25:00.240]   and never will and the like.
[03:25:00.240 --> 03:25:02.440]   - It's a really interesting idea.
[03:25:02.440 --> 03:25:04.700]   So let me give a shout out to Perplexity
[03:25:04.700 --> 03:25:08.340]   that I'm using here to sort of summarize
[03:25:08.340 --> 03:25:10.680]   and take quick notes and get little snippets of stuff,
[03:25:10.680 --> 03:25:12.380]   which is extremely useful.
[03:25:12.380 --> 03:25:16.380]   But books are not just about information transfer.
[03:25:16.380 --> 03:25:18.740]   It's just as you said,
[03:25:18.740 --> 03:25:20.940]   it's a journey together with a set of ideas
[03:25:20.940 --> 03:25:22.100]   and it's a conversation.
[03:25:22.100 --> 03:25:25.660]   And getting a summary of the book,
[03:25:25.660 --> 03:25:28.580]   as the cliche thing is,
[03:25:28.580 --> 03:25:31.380]   it's really getting to the destination without the journey.
[03:25:31.380 --> 03:25:33.900]   And the journey is the thing that's important,
[03:25:33.900 --> 03:25:35.020]   thinking through stuff.
[03:25:35.020 --> 03:25:38.480]   And I've actually learned, I've been surprised.
[03:25:38.480 --> 03:25:40.080]   I've learned, I've trained my brain
[03:25:40.080 --> 03:25:42.900]   to be able to get the same thing from audiobooks also.
[03:25:42.900 --> 03:25:44.420]   It's a little bit more difficult
[03:25:44.420 --> 03:25:46.300]   because you don't control the pacing.
[03:25:46.300 --> 03:25:48.020]   Sometimes pausing is nice,
[03:25:48.020 --> 03:25:49.660]   but you can still get it from audiobooks,
[03:25:49.660 --> 03:25:53.300]   so it's an audio version of books.
[03:25:53.300 --> 03:25:55.680]   And that allows you to also go on a journey together
[03:25:55.680 --> 03:25:56.940]   and sometimes more convenient
[03:25:56.940 --> 03:25:58.420]   'cause you can take it to more places with you.
[03:25:58.420 --> 03:25:59.260]   - That's right.
[03:25:59.260 --> 03:26:00.980]   - But there is a magical thing,
[03:26:00.980 --> 03:26:04.720]   and I also trying to train myself mostly to use Kindle,
[03:26:04.720 --> 03:26:07.220]   the digital version of books.
[03:26:07.220 --> 03:26:11.780]   But there is unfortunately still a magical thing
[03:26:11.780 --> 03:26:13.980]   about being there with the page.
[03:26:13.980 --> 03:26:16.320]   - Well, audiobooks are definitely not to be scorned
[03:26:16.320 --> 03:26:18.300]   because as people have pointed out,
[03:26:18.300 --> 03:26:22.660]   the original traditions of literature were oral, right?
[03:26:22.660 --> 03:26:27.320]   So that's actually the 1.0 version, right?
[03:26:27.320 --> 03:26:29.940]   And combining these things is probably the key.
[03:26:29.940 --> 03:26:34.060]   I think one of the things I find so wonderful
[03:26:34.060 --> 03:26:36.740]   about the best lectures that I've heard
[03:26:36.740 --> 03:26:40.580]   is it's a chance to hear someone thinking out loud,
[03:26:40.580 --> 03:26:41.860]   not laying down the law,
[03:26:41.860 --> 03:26:46.860]   but taking you through a series of logical moves,
[03:26:46.860 --> 03:26:52.460]   imaginative leaps, alternative suggestions,
[03:26:52.460 --> 03:26:57.460]   and that's much more than data transfer.
[03:26:57.460 --> 03:27:01.580]   - The use case of AI as a companion as you read
[03:27:01.580 --> 03:27:05.100]   is really exciting to me.
[03:27:05.100 --> 03:27:09.740]   I've been using it recently to basically, as you read,
[03:27:09.740 --> 03:27:11.700]   you can have a conversation with a system
[03:27:11.700 --> 03:27:13.700]   that has access to a lot of things
[03:27:13.700 --> 03:27:15.620]   about a particular paragraph.
[03:27:15.620 --> 03:27:18.500]   And I've been really surprised how my brain,
[03:27:18.500 --> 03:27:20.380]   when given some extra ideas,
[03:27:20.380 --> 03:27:23.100]   other recommendations of books,
[03:27:23.100 --> 03:27:25.040]   but also just like a summary of other ideas
[03:27:25.040 --> 03:27:26.280]   from elsewhere in the universe
[03:27:26.280 --> 03:27:28.180]   that relates to this paragraph,
[03:27:28.180 --> 03:27:31.500]   it sparks your imagination and thought
[03:27:31.500 --> 03:27:35.740]   and you see the actual richness in the thing you're reading.
[03:27:35.740 --> 03:27:37.780]   Now, nobody's, to my knowledge,
[03:27:37.780 --> 03:27:41.580]   has implemented a really intuitive interaction
[03:27:41.580 --> 03:27:43.060]   between AI and the text.
[03:27:43.060 --> 03:27:48.060]   Unfortunately, partially because the books are protected
[03:27:48.340 --> 03:27:51.380]   under DRM, and so there's like a wall
[03:27:51.380 --> 03:27:54.100]   where you can't access, the AI can't access the thing.
[03:27:54.100 --> 03:27:56.140]   So if you want to play with that kind of thing,
[03:27:56.140 --> 03:27:59.500]   you have to break the law a little bit,
[03:27:59.500 --> 03:28:01.260]   which is not a nice thing, not a good thing.
[03:28:01.260 --> 03:28:06.260]   But just like with music, Napster came up.
[03:28:06.260 --> 03:28:11.660]   People started illegally sharing music.
[03:28:11.660 --> 03:28:14.500]   And the answer to that was Spotify,
[03:28:14.500 --> 03:28:16.700]   which made the sharing of music, revolutionized everything
[03:28:16.700 --> 03:28:18.620]   and made the sharing of music much easier.
[03:28:18.620 --> 03:28:20.180]   So there are some technological things
[03:28:20.180 --> 03:28:22.700]   that can enrich the experience of reading,
[03:28:22.700 --> 03:28:27.140]   but the actual painful, long process of reading
[03:28:27.140 --> 03:28:31.820]   is really useful, just like boredom is useful.
[03:28:31.820 --> 03:28:32.660]   - That's right.
[03:28:32.660 --> 03:28:33.500]   - It's also called just sitting there--
[03:28:33.500 --> 03:28:34.620]   - Underrated virtue.
[03:28:34.620 --> 03:28:36.700]   - Yeah, yeah, and of course,
[03:28:36.700 --> 03:28:40.980]   you have to see the smartphone as a enemy, I would say,
[03:28:40.980 --> 03:28:44.860]   as of that special time you have to think
[03:28:44.860 --> 03:28:48.420]   because social media companies are maximized
[03:28:48.420 --> 03:28:51.220]   to get your engagement, they wanna grab your attention.
[03:28:51.220 --> 03:28:54.300]   And they grab that attention by making you
[03:28:54.300 --> 03:28:56.060]   as brain dead as possible and getting you
[03:28:56.060 --> 03:28:57.840]   to look at more and more and more things.
[03:28:57.840 --> 03:28:59.780]   So it's nice and fun, it's great,
[03:28:59.780 --> 03:29:02.700]   recommend it highly, it's good for dopamine rush.
[03:29:02.700 --> 03:29:07.700]   But see it as a counter force to the process
[03:29:07.700 --> 03:29:12.940]   of sitting with an idea for a prolonged period of time,
[03:29:12.940 --> 03:29:16.300]   taking a journey through an expert,
[03:29:16.300 --> 03:29:20.100]   eloquently conveying that idea and growing
[03:29:20.100 --> 03:29:25.140]   by having a conversation with that idea
[03:29:25.140 --> 03:29:26.700]   in a book is really, really powerful.
[03:29:26.700 --> 03:29:29.900]   So I agree with you totally.
[03:29:29.900 --> 03:29:33.580]   What gives you hope about the future of humanity?
[03:29:33.580 --> 03:29:36.100]   We've talked about the dark past.
[03:29:36.100 --> 03:29:41.580]   What gives you hope for the light at the end of the tunnel?
[03:29:41.580 --> 03:29:45.980]   So we talked indeed about a lot of latent,
[03:29:45.980 --> 03:29:48.540]   really damaging and negative energies
[03:29:48.540 --> 03:29:49.900]   that are part of human nature.
[03:29:49.900 --> 03:29:53.540]   But I find hope in another aspect of human nature,
[03:29:53.540 --> 03:29:57.020]   and that is the sheer variety
[03:29:57.020 --> 03:30:01.660]   of human reactions to situations.
[03:30:01.660 --> 03:30:06.660]   The very fact that history is full of so many stories
[03:30:07.220 --> 03:30:11.860]   of amazing endurance, amazing resilience,
[03:30:11.860 --> 03:30:17.860]   the will to build up even after the horrors have passed.
[03:30:17.860 --> 03:30:22.940]   This to me is an inexhaustible source of optimism.
[03:30:22.940 --> 03:30:24.620]   And there are some people
[03:30:24.620 --> 03:30:27.900]   who condemn cultural appropriation
[03:30:27.900 --> 03:30:31.460]   and say that borrowing from one culture to another
[03:30:31.460 --> 03:30:33.060]   is to be condemned.
[03:30:33.060 --> 03:30:35.540]   Well, the problem is a synonym
[03:30:35.540 --> 03:30:38.900]   for cultural appropriation is world history.
[03:30:38.900 --> 03:30:43.900]   Trade, transfer of ideas, influences,
[03:30:43.900 --> 03:30:47.500]   valuing that which is unlike your own culture
[03:30:47.500 --> 03:30:50.980]   is also a form of appropriation, quite literally.
[03:30:50.980 --> 03:30:55.980]   And so that multitude of human reactions
[03:30:55.980 --> 03:31:00.100]   and the fact that our experience is so unlimited
[03:31:00.100 --> 03:31:03.380]   as history testifies, gives me great hope for the future.
[03:31:03.380 --> 03:31:05.740]   - Yeah, and the willingness of humans
[03:31:05.740 --> 03:31:08.180]   to explore all of that with curiosity,
[03:31:08.180 --> 03:31:12.700]   even when the empires fall and the dreams are broken,
[03:31:12.700 --> 03:31:13.660]   we rise again.
[03:31:13.660 --> 03:31:15.140]   - That's right, unceasingly.
[03:31:15.140 --> 03:31:15.980]   (Lex laughs)
[03:31:15.980 --> 03:31:18.740]   - Vejas, thank you so much for your incredible work,
[03:31:18.740 --> 03:31:20.700]   your incredible lectures, your books,
[03:31:20.700 --> 03:31:22.540]   and thank you for talking today.
[03:31:22.540 --> 03:31:24.440]   - Thank you for this, such a fun chat.
[03:31:24.440 --> 03:31:27.100]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:31:27.100 --> 03:31:28.900]   with Vejas Ludovicius.
[03:31:28.900 --> 03:31:30.060]   To support this podcast,
[03:31:30.060 --> 03:31:33.060]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[03:31:33.060 --> 03:31:36.900]   And now let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.
[03:31:36.900 --> 03:31:41.820]   History repeats itself, first as a tragedy,
[03:31:41.820 --> 03:31:43.840]   second as a farce.
[03:31:43.840 --> 03:31:46.300]   Thank you for listening.
[03:31:46.300 --> 03:31:48.320]   I hope to see you next time.
[03:31:48.320 --> 03:31:50.900]   (upbeat music)
[03:31:50.900 --> 03:31:54.320]   (upbeat music continues)
[03:31:54.320 --> 03:32:04.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
