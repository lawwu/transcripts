[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.320]   All right, next question is from Nathaniel.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.000]   He asks, "How do I plan a wedding without drowning in minutia?"
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.680]   He goes on to explain that he's getting married in a month.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.560]   Partner's amazing, but he's getting overloaded with minor details.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.760]   Um, all right.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.760]   Wedding planning.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.080]   I was very young when I got married, so I don't remember a lot of this.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.360]   And our wedding was informal.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.760]   I think I, based on some of the weddings I've been to recently, I now understand
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.000]   it as a more complicated procedure, uh, than it once was.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.240]   So here's the, I would say the big point I would deliver here, Nathaniel,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.560]   is that these vendors work for you.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.120]   You're paying them.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.960]   So you have a lot of flexibility in setting the standards by which your
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.120]   interactions are going to happen.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.240]   Most vendors are not productivity gurus.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.520]   Right?
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.240]   So left to their default is going to be like, I don't know.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.120]   I'm just going to shoot you off a text message or an email.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.920]   I have a bunch of clients.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.960]   I'm just like, all day long.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.040]   And you could get sucked into that.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.560]   And then you're all day long.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.280]   It would be the technical description of what it's like to fall
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.280]   into the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.280]   I say, you should figure out, here's how I want to work with you.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.040]   Here's how I want to communicate, where we want to store information, how we
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.960]   deal with various types of interactions that will happen common in our relationship.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.200]   Here's how it's going to work.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.480]   Okay.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.280]   I'm paying you.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.720]   So you kind of have to say yes.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.600]   And you can engineer these interactions to be much less ad hoc, much less
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.880]   haphazard and require much less on demand attention.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.000]   So for example, you might use dedicated email addresses, a dedicated address for
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.960]   the planning itself, or even multiple dedicated addresses for different
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.400]   aspects of the planning, wedding planning, office hours could be a critical idea.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.000]   I have 30 minutes put aside every day.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.360]   Maybe it's during your drive home.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.640]   Right.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.520]   I don't know when it is.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.840]   This is the time that you just keep every time one of these vendors is like, okay,
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.840]   we're not sure about, uh, like the lilies.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.000]   We have a different type of purple.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.440]   We're not sure if it's going to work or we need your, your, your, uh,
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.680]   approval and this or that you always just say until they have it.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.480]   Seared into their brain.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.600]   Call me during, you know, four to four to four 30.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.320]   You can always call me.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.760]   Don't even bother emailing me about just call me then I'm always here.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.840]   And you know what?
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.800]   They will love that.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.520]   Vendors love just like any type of client.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.400]   They really do love the clarity.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.480]   I know exactly how to get an answer.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.880]   I don't have to send something out there and try to remember it.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.000]   And is it going to be like all my other jerk clients and forget to respond to this?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.640]   I can always just call Nathaniel.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.800]   I always call him at four.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.960]   He's always there.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.480]   There's 50 or 60% of your communication.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.640]   Uh, agree on processes in advance.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.080]   If like, this is what we're going to do.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.320]   Okay.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.360]   We're picking the flowers.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.440]   Let's talk this through in our initial meeting.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.360]   Like what's going to happen here.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.160]   This'll happen.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.480]   We'll have to see these samples.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.480]   We'll have to give you some approval.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.560]   You're gonna build a sample thing.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.440]   You'll have these questions.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.720]   Figure out the whole process in advance and sit there and write it down.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.200]   Here's how we're going to do it.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.360]   By this date, you'll put this here.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.880]   We have a conversation for a half hour here.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.280]   We'll deal with all of these things.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.560]   Put the photos up here.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.480]   I will, you figure out the whole process.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.640]   It all goes onto your calendar.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.480]   It's all written down.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.920]   They see it.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.480]   You see it.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.320]   Not a single ounce of planning energy has to be further invested
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.640]   in this particular interaction.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.000]   You have it all figured out again.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.960]   Vendors like clients in general want clarity more than they want.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.080]   Like, oh, I can just reach you at any point.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.000]   Reaching you at any point is not the big deal.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.120]   The big deal is getting you to actually do stuff and not them have to not worry about it.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.480]   Clarity trumps accessibility.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.400]   Finally, wedding planning is actually a good situation in which hiring a part-time
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.280]   assistant is worth it.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.800]   It's a type of work where a part-time assistant is actually quite useful.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.120]   It's like very specific.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.680]   It doesn't require domain knowledge about like what you do for a living.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.440]   You're spending, and this is looking at the official estimate of the average
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.640]   wedding budget of 2022, you're spending "all of your money" anyways.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.000]   So the cost of a few hundred dollars a month for the part-time assistant is nothing.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.440]   And it could make a really big difference.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.160]   Pay for a good one.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.600]   It's worth it.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.440]   And have them be the point of contact, like three or four of these vendors.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.120]   You talk to them.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.360]   So if you can't get your vendors to call you at the same time, you have a half hour
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.160]   conversation every other day with your assistant.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.560]   We're like, here's all the things going on.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.800]   You're like, great.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.160]   Here's my answer to this, my answer to that.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.280]   For this one, get me a sample.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.400]   For this one, get on my calendar, you know, a meeting day.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.720]   And the very last suggestion I would have, Nathaniel, is have a certain half day where
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.000]   this is when you do the meetings that have to happen.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.440]   And you just build your work schedule around leaving, whatever, Friday noon to four clear.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.480]   So it's really easy when people like, all right, well, we got to call.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.440]   We got to talk about this.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.960]   He's like, yeah, just grab a time, use a calendar, have this time open in the same
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.600]   same period.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.680]   Now, the reason why I'm going into sub steps about wedding planning, I need to
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.040]   qualify this so it doesn't get back to my wife.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.440]   And she's like, wait a second, what do you want to?
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.720]   Why are you thinking so much about wedding planning?
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.160]   The reason why I'm getting into this is because what I just went through there applies
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160]   to many different professional relationships you might have in your life.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.560]   Big conferences you're trying to organize.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.480]   A new client that you're trying to get on board, a new service you're offering, whatever.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.080]   There's lots of professional situations in which a lot of haphazard ad hoc
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.440]   interactions going to have to happen to make it pull off.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.680]   Do not in those situations just default to let's just rock and roll, man.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.840]   Here's my text message.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.240]   I have WhatsApp going.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.800]   I'll check email all the time.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.000]   And let's just the don't do that.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.440]   Take the time up front to be like, how are we going to structure these interactions and all
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.880]   the different types of things I just talked about and my suggestions for Nathaniel for
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.240]   wedding planning can apply to any number of other professional situations in which a
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.520]   complicated thing involving many different vendors or clients and peers, colleagues has to
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.360]   come together. Structure it.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.960]   Do not just rock and roll.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   Thank you.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
