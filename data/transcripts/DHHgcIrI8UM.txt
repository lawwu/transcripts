[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   Don't just say good job, but make sure you're telling the person specifically
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.940]   what was good and what they could do more of.
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.840]   Like the purpose of praise is to let them know what to do more of.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.400]   In fact, if you think about radical candor as helping someone else scratch
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.800]   an itch on an unreachable spot in your back, you know, you got to say, yeah,
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.600]   that's good or no, that's not good.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.100]   And you need to be able to say both.
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.800]   So praise is really important, but let's say this is not praise.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.300]   This is a little criticism.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.800]   You want to give someone who you love and who knows that you love them.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.800]   Hopefully, you know them well enough to know how things land for them.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.000]   So you want to go in, make sure that you're humble, that you're not sure
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.600]   you're right.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.700]   To me, I call it candor and not the truth.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.000]   Candor implies here's how I understand the situation.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.600]   I'm also really curious to know how you understand the situation.
