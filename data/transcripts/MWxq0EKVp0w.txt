[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:17.680]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6, reading from verse 10 to verse 13. From
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:25.880]   verse 10 to verse 13 in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians. "Finally,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.840]   my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:43.040]   of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:51.440]   against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.480]   darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore, take
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:08.320]   unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.600]   having done all, to stand."
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.720]   We come back once more to discuss and to consider together this most important and vital statement
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:28.040]   which the apostle makes here at the end of this great epistle to the Ephesians. We are
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.800]   doing so for a number of reasons. There are those perhaps who, hearing a text like this
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.440]   and hearing the reading at the beginning from the book of the prophet Ezekiel and the book
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.800]   of the prophet Isaiah, may wonder what all this is about and what relevance it can possibly
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.840]   have to the individual Christian life or to the life of the community as a whole. Well,
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.280]   we have been at pains to point out that there is nothing perhaps which is quite so relevant
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.040]   to our individual and corporate conditions this morning as this very passage which we
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.760]   are looking at together.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.280]   For after all, the most important thing we can ever discover is the nature of this life
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.880]   and of this world in which we find ourselves. The apostle's first intent in writing this,
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.280]   of course, was to help these Ephesians, and through them all subsequent Christians who
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.800]   should ever read these words, in the living of the Christian life. The apostle's theme,
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.920]   if you like, in a sense, is that of sanctification and of holiness. And you notice the way in
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.080]   which he deals with that, how different it is from our method. I wonder when you last
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.280]   heard in a convention on holiness or sanctification a series of addresses on the devil and on
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.360]   demons. No, you probably haven't heard it, because we have all become so subjective.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.280]   We start with ourselves, we end with ourselves, we want a little message that will make us
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.240]   feel nice and comfortable, offer us victory, and deliver us. That isn't how the New Testament
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:18.920]   deals with sanctification. It shows us the nature of the conflict. It instructs us. It
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.800]   teaches us. And according to the apostle here, a man who doesn't realize that he has to
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.440]   fight not flesh and blood, not men, but these principalities and powers, the wiles of the
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:38.840]   devil, and so on, he is the merest tyrant and is certainly doomed to defeat. So there
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.560]   is nothing more practical than this from the standpoint of living the Christian life. The
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.640]   apostle in writing to the Corinthians says, you remember, in his second epistle, second
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.520]   chapter, verse eleven, "We are not ignorant of his devices." He says, "I know something
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.880]   about the wiles of the devil, what he tries to do in a church and amongst Christian people.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.000]   We are not ignorant of his devices." And it's because he wasn't ignorant of the devices
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.080]   of the devil that he was able to instruct and to teach and to help Christian people.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.040]   And that is what he's doing here at this point also. But as I've been reminding you,
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.240]   there is a sense in which one rarely doesn't understand the whole purpose of salvation
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.120]   unless one understands this. Why did the Son of God come into this world? Well, to put
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.120]   it broadly, we can put it like this with the apostle John. He came that he might destroy
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.640]   the works of the devil. That's what the apostle, the inspired apostle says. That the
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:48.040]   Lord Jesus Christ came into the world and did all he did, that he might destroy, disannul,
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.480]   undo the works of the devil. So if we don't know what the works of the devil are, how
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:02.200]   can we possibly understand the purpose of God in sending his Son into this world?
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.520]   So you see, this is something which is quite basic and fundamental. But as I've been
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.080]   saying, it's essential to an understanding of the state of the world as it is this morning.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.680]   We hope to deal with this at greater length on another occasion. But unless you and I
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.480]   are awake to the fact that there are demonic forces and powers obviously at work in the
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:34.120]   world today, well then we must be very blind indeed. So this is essential to an understanding
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.760]   of the whole condition of the human race at this moment and the course of history.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.680]   And if you want another practical reason for considering it all, you may have noticed a
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.680]   kind of recrudescence in an interest in spiritism and psychic phenomena. You always get that
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.840]   after wars, you always get it at a time of trouble and of difficulty and of crisis. It's
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.080]   becoming popular. It's creeping into the life of the Christian church, alas. And so
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.560]   it's important that we should understand the teaching that we're given here in order
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:21.080]   that we may recognise spiritism for what it really is, the work of demons. I hope also
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.120]   to touch on that on a later occasion.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:31.120]   But now here are therefore some good general reasons why we should consider this. I'm
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.280]   taking this time in introducing my subject this morning because I'm well aware of the
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.160]   fact that this kind of teaching is strange today, not only to the world but even to the
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:49.120]   church. It's unusual. It's been forgotten. That is the supreme tragedy of course. This
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.040]   is the height of the devil's subtlety and ability that he has so successfully concealed
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:02.600]   himself or transported himself into an angel of light that so many people no longer believe
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:09.480]   in the devil at all and are not aware of his existence and indeed regard any consideration
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:16.240]   of the devil as more or less of a joke and thereby of course put themselves into a very
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.120]   serious condition. Listen to what the apostle Peter has to say about such people in the
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:30.720]   second epistle and in his second chapter beginning at verse 10. He's talking about certain people
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.440]   who have gone astray. He says, "But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:45.960]   of uncleanness and despise government. Presumptuous are they, self-willed. They are not afraid
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:54.280]   to speak evil of dignities." That's it. "Speak evil of dignities, whereas angels,
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:00.320]   which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.640]   the Lord." The angels don't speak disparagingly and jocularly about the devil and demons.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.720]   No, they, though they are much greater than we are, he says, greater in power and might,
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.280]   they bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord. "But these as natural
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:25.640]   brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:33.800]   not, and shall perish utterly in their own corruption." Then let's reinforce that
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:39.840]   with a word from the epistle of Jude to show you the seriousness of this matter and how
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.400]   there is nothing more monstrous than that people should joke about the devil and regard
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:51.520]   that as the height of jocularity. When you're talking about the devil and about evil spirits,
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:09:00.400]   look at it in the epistle of Jude in the eighth verse and so on. He says, "Likewise also,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:09.840]   these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. Yet
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:17.680]   Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses,
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:26.040]   durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, 'The Lord rebuke thee.' But these
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:32.400]   speak evil of those things which they know not, but what they know naturally as brute
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.720]   beasts in those things they corrupt themselves." Very well then, we are reminded that we are
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:45.400]   dealing here with not only a vitally important subject, but one which we must handle carefully
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:53.800]   and with great reverence. And what we have discovered is this, that there are great powers
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:01.000]   of evil at work in this world. We looked at them according to the apostle's description
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:10.160]   of them last Sunday morning. The devil, principalities, powers, the world rulers of this darkness,
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:18.320]   spirits of evil and of wickedness, in high or in heavenly places. Now then, here then
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.760]   is the position, as the apostle paints it to us, and as we find it taught elsewhere
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:31.760]   in the Bible, that while we are living in this world, passing through this world, we
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:37.360]   are not confronted merely by the problem of meeting men and human ability and difficulties
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:43.880]   which arise from men and women, human nature as such. But at the back of all this, there
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:52.160]   are these unseen mighty spiritual powers and forces. Very well.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:58.440]   Now the next question that surely must arise from our consideration is this. Where have
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:06.940]   these forces come from? How have they ever come into being at all? Or, if you like it
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:18.600]   in another form, if we say that these unseen spiritual forces are evil, what is the origin
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:25.680]   of evil? Where has evil come from? Now there is a great question, isn't it? And a very
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.840]   important question. It's a very important question from the standpoint of our belief
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:36.360]   in God. There are many people today who are atheists, they don't believe in God, and
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:43.600]   it's very largely because of this very question. They are troubled by this problem of evil
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:50.680]   and the origin of evil. So it's very important that as Christian people we should have some
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.160]   understanding of this, not only for our own peace of mind, but in order that we may be
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:02.080]   able to help others. Or let me put it the other way round. It has often happened that
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:09.720]   when people have come to understand the true nature of evil, they have come to a belief
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:15.840]   in God. Now there was a man, a philosopher, who was well known and popular a few years
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.960]   ago. I refer to the late Dr. Job. I'm not expressing any opinion as to what I think
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:28.720]   of his opinions, but I do say this, that he said in a book, that whereas once he was an
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.960]   atheist, but had now come to believe in God, he said that the thing that had brought him
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:41.600]   to that belief was the realization as the result of the Spanish Civil War, and then
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:49.680]   the Second World War, that there were obviously spiritual forces of evil. He couldn't explain
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:55.200]   these events merely in human terms. He came to believe in the whole category in the realm
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:02.160]   of the spiritual, and ultimately that brought him to believe in the being of God. So you
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.880]   see it is very important that we should understand this. Our faith is not complete if we don't
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:14.040]   understand this. Our belief in God is involved, I say, in the understanding of this particular
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:22.240]   subject. And therefore we are bound to meet it and to face it. And in addition, as I say,
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.200]   you'll never understand the whole course of the history of the world if you don't
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:33.560]   understand this teaching. You won't understand the past. You won't understand the present.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.120]   And still less will you have any real hope with regard to the future. Very well, let's
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:46.000]   see what the Bible tells us about this. What is the origin of the devil, the principalities
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.640]   and powers, the spirits of wickedness in the heavenly places, the rulers, the world rulers
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:14:00.920]   of the darkness of this world? Well now, before we look at the biblical answer to the question,
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.720]   let me remind you that this is a problem that has engaged the minds and the thoughts of
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:15.960]   men throughout the running centuries. There was a view held for a very long time in the
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:27.840]   ancient world that evil came from a God who was virtually equal to the Lord God Almighty
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:35.480]   in power and in strength. They said there was a good God, there was an evil God. They
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:41.960]   called this the demiurge. And they verily believed that that was the explanation. And
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:50.440]   that these two gods were equal in their eternity and in their powers. Many of them believed
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.480]   that it was this evil God that had created this world altogether. Others believed it
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.120]   was the good God who had created the world, but that the other had interfered with it
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:08.320]   and so on. Now there was an ancient view which held sway for many a century. Others believed,
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:16.400]   and many still believe this, they believe in the eternity of evil. They say evil is
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:23.360]   something that is in the very warp and woof of the whole creation. And it's not something
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:32.640]   that has come into being, it was always there. Evil is an eternal quality in and of itself.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:39.080]   It's always been, well, because it is something that is inherent in the constitution of things.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:45.560]   They don't attempt to explain its origin, they just postulate that evil is something
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:52.280]   that always has been, absolutely eternal in and of itself.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:58.480]   And then coming to the third view which I just want to mention in passing, the prevailing
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:08.880]   view today is this, that there is no such thing as evil at all. That what has been called
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:16.000]   evil is really just the absence of good, or the absence of perfection. This is the view,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   of course, that arises out of the whole theory, supposition of evolution. You see, the view
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.760]   is that everything is developing and growing and advancing. Well, obviously, they say,
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.280]   we haven't arrived at absolute perfection yet, and until you arrive at perfection there
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:41.880]   will be certain defects, there will be certain blemishes, there will be an element of incompleteness.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:47.960]   And that is, they say, what has always been called evil. But it's wrong. It isn't
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.560]   positive, it's only negative. It's just that things are not what they ought to be,
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.280]   they haven't arrived at this ultimate perfection. It's a lack of qualities, rather than a
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:02.840]   positive entity in and of itself. A mere negative condition, rather than a positive one.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:08.360]   Now, of course, you can see at a glance how vitally important it is whether that view
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.520]   is true or whether it isn't true. If this view is true, well then, all we need is a
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.080]   little patience. Of course, we may need to wait a few million years before this great
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.480]   process will advance and evolve until we've arrived at perfection, but in any case, it's
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.800]   going to happen. So, we must put up with things as they are and exhort one another to make
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.720]   the best of it while we are here and consider ourselves unfortunate that we are living now
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:38.000]   and not in the number of millennia that are to come. But it will, of course, immediately
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.960]   affect one's whole view of man and his ultimate destiny, of life and what can be done with
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:49.540]   the world at this present time. Well, now, there are some of the views outside the Bible.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:55.800]   But come, let us turn to the biblical view and be positive. I'm not wasting your time
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:01.160]   in dealing with those other theories. They're hardly worthy of it. And we will see that,
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:08.280]   of course, as we look at the biblical teaching. Here is the biblical teaching. The Bible starts
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:22.100]   with God, "In the beginning, God." God over all, God from everlasting to everlasting,
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:33.300]   God self-subsistent and existent within himself. But God in his own inscrutable wisdom is determining
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:43.780]   to create, and first and foremost, creating the hosts of heaven. God created the hosts
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:50.100]   of heaven for his own purpose, for his own ends, in order that they might serve certain
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:55.820]   purposes and functions and that they might carry out his behests. The author of the epistle
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:01.700]   to the Hebrews says, "Are they not all ministering spirits?" He is referring to the angels.
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:08.660]   In other words, the Bible teaches that God created, first and foremost, the heavens and
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:16.420]   these denizens or citizens of the heavenly regions, which seem to be divided into angels
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:24.100]   and principalities and powers. Now, these were all made and created by God, and they
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:33.780]   were all, of course, perfect and complete and entire. There is the starting point. Now,
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.020]   we are not talking about the earth. We are not talking about the world at the moment.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:44.740]   We are talking about these heavenly realms and regions, and God creating these spiritual
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:50.700]   entities, angels, principalities, powers. We are not given many details about them,
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.380]   but if you look at the book of Revelation, you will read there, of course, it is all
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:20:00.700]   in symbols about certain beasts and elders and so on. Well, there are gradations, there
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:06.860]   are divisions of office, which we do not understand perfectly, but we can sum it up like that.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:15.620]   Angels, principalities, powers, all perfect, all glorious, and all under God and ministering
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:26.140]   for God and to God. Very well, what happened? What is the next step? Well, now, here we
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:32.940]   come to the very essence of the biblical teaching about this matter. We start with the person
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:42.260]   and personality of the devil again. Now, it is perfectly clear that the devil was originally
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:50.420]   one of these bright, angelic creatures made by God. If you want proof of that, I have
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.860]   already given you two in those portions we read at the beginning, but take the book of
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:21:00.980]   Job in the first chapter and the sixth verse. Now, there was a day when the sons of God
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:09.940]   came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. Now, the sons
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:15.860]   of God in the Old Testament generally stand for the angels. And here we are told that
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:22.700]   a day came when the angels presented themselves before God, and amongst these sons of God
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:31.100]   was Satan, the devil. Satan also came among them. And in the same way, if you read again
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:40.580]   at your leisure those passages out of Ezekiel 28 and Isaiah 14, you will be driven and compelled
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:48.460]   to come to the same conclusion. Lucifer, son of the morning. The description there, though
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:55.700]   primarily perhaps meant to apply to Babylon and to the Chaldean power, is generally agreed
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:01.020]   to extend well beyond that. That is the custom, of course, in prophecy. You start with the
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:05.620]   immediate, but you use that for a further light, in the same way as you find it on the
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:10.940]   other side. You will read many prophecies which appear to refer to King David alone,
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:16.060]   but obviously they go beyond David and they point to the Messiah. There are promises made
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.420]   to the children of Israel which primarily refer clearly to their coming back from the
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:25.460]   captivity of Babylon, but they are too big for that. They are pictures of the Christian
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:30.260]   salvation, the salvation of the soul, and that is why they are quoted in the New Testament
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:34.660]   to show the fulfilment of the prophecy. Well, now, it is exactly the same on this negative
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:44.020]   side. In describing the fall of Tyrus, or the fall of Babylon, the prophets were inspired
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:50.380]   to go beyond that. Tyrus and Babylon are just earthly powers that are opposed to God, so
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:55.660]   they are symbols, if you like, of the power of the devil and his forces. And so what is
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:03.100]   said about them rarely is applicable to him. And thus we find that this great power is
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:10.380]   described as wandering backwards and forwards, was in the Garden of Eden, amongst these precious
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:17.820]   gems. In other words, the whole impression is that the devil was one of these great angels,
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:23.500]   one of these created powers which God brought into being, that they might serve him and
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:30.820]   that he might use them to his own honour and to his own glory. Very well. There is the
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:40.420]   great original picture. But something has obviously happened. What is it? How do you
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:47.420]   explain the origin of evil? Where have evil and sin come from? Now, the answer that is
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:56.540]   given here is that there is what we may describe as a pre-cosmic fall. When I say "cosmic,"
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:01.100]   I am thinking of this universe that you and I dwell in and inhabit, the universe as we
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:10.340]   know it. But according to the Bible, before this cosmos was created, there was a tremendous
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:17.620]   calamity, a fall, a pre-cosmic fall. What does that mean? Well, it is the thing that
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:26.220]   is described, you see, in Ezekiel 28 again and Isaiah 14. If you want a reference to
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.460]   it in the New Testament, you will find it in the first epistle to Timothy in the third
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:35.300]   chapter and the sixth verse, where you will read this. The apostle is telling Timothy
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:43.380]   not to ordain a novice as an elder or as a bishop. He says, "Not a novice, lest being
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:53.780]   lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the devil." A most significant statement.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:59.700]   Take that with the two passages from the Prophets, and this is what you find.
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:06.140]   Here amidst all these bright angelic beings was this outstanding one, Lucifer, son of
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:17.260]   the morning, one of the greatest, the ablest, the most powerful of them all. He became ambitious.
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:23.460]   The term "ambition," you remember, was used concerning him. He became dissatisfied
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:30.500]   with his position of subservience to God. He desired to be as God himself. So he rebelled
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:36.700]   against God. He raised himself against God with his ambition, lifted up with pride, as
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:45.900]   Paul puts it there in 1 Timothy. Lifted up with pride. He withstood God. He became a rebel.
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:55.780]   And the result of this was that he fell. He was punished, of course, for that. And not
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:06.460]   only that, he lost his perfection. And he lost the freedom that he had formerly enjoyed.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:14.700]   But here is the great principle which we must lay hold of. God, again in his own inscrutable
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:20.860]   wisdom, allowed this to happen. And it doesn't seem to me to be very difficult to understand,
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:27.340]   if one may speak with reverence, why God allowed that. I have reminded you that these beings
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:34.380]   were created perfect. And anything that is perfect must have absolute freedom of will.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:39.860]   So obviously these beings had complete freedom of will. Anything that's perfect must be
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.900]   free. Adam, as created perfect, was free. Adam had free will. Nobody else has ever had
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:51.900]   it since, but Adam had it. And it is this very quality of freedom that shows the possibility
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.500]   of rebellion and of falling, and of therefore the origin of evil. Well, thus it came to
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:02.860]   pass that God, having created this being perfect, he exercised the freedom of his will in a
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:09.420]   wrong direction through pride and being lifted up, and so he fell. And fell under condemnation
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:22.900]   and fell under punishment. But the story doesn't end there. In addition to doing this himself,
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:28.900]   it is made clear that the devil at the same time persuaded certain other of these angelic
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:35.780]   beings and powers and principalities to follow him and to do the same thing. Now let me give
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.300]   you my scriptural warrant for saying that. You've got it, for instance, in the book
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:45.700]   of Revelation chapter 12, verse 4. Again, remember, it's symbolic and it's imagery,
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:52.100]   but here it is. He's talking about that great dragon, the devil. His tail drew the
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:59.500]   third part of the stars of heaven and it cast them to the earth. That is surely a symbolic
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:04.780]   way of saying that the devil, when he fell himself, dragged down with him some third
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:10.300]   of these great powers whom God had created in that way. Then there's a statement like
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:16.060]   this in the second epistle of Peter, chapter 2, verse 4. "For if God spared not the angels
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:22.380]   that sinned, but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:28.100]   be reserved unto judgment." And then the statement goes on, "But what I'm emphasizing
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:33.620]   is that the angels sinned, some of them, and they were cast down to Tartarus, to hell,
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:38.460]   and were delivered into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment." And you'll
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:43.780]   get the same thing in the sixth verse of the epistle of Jude.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:50.340]   Now then, here you see is the picture that is given. Still remember, this is before the
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:57.580]   creation of the world. The devil influences these others and together they rebel against
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:07.780]   God. And so they fall, they become evil, and they are under God's condemnation. But they
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:14.580]   are sufficiently great in power and in number to form and to establish a kingdom, a kingdom
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:23.500]   of evil, a kingdom of darkness. And the whole ambition and the object of all the activities
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:32.380]   of the devil and his cohorts is to be against God. The devil lifted up with pride, fell,
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:39.140]   and now, of course, because of his fall, he is animated by a hatred, an intense hatred
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:44.900]   of God. He has only one ambition, and that is to destroy God's works, to produce chaos.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:49.080]   God is a God of order. The devil is intent upon producing chaos.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.700]   Now you see, you begin to see the relevance of all this. The world has been a place of
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:57.300]   chaos, hasn't it? And we know it is a place of chaos today. Well, here it is, you see,
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:02.780]   these great powers, they have established a kingdom, and now there is a great warfare.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:08.460]   God and his bright angelic hosts, and the heaven against the kingdom of the devil, the
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:16.820]   kingdom of darkness, the forces, the spirits of evil that are set against.
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:25.820]   Now there in its essence is the biblical explanation of the origin of evil. That is how it has
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:34.740]   ever come into being at all. This tremendous event there in the angelic and in the heavenly
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:41.340]   realm, right above us all together. Now I am emphasizing this again for this selfsame
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:48.700]   reason. The whole tragedy of the world today, as I see it, is that we are so utterly earthbound.
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.940]   You see, we start with men, we start with the world. It is us ourselves, and especially
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:57.700]   the twentieth century. But my dear friend, if you want to understand the twentieth century,
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:01.780]   the first thing you have got to do is not only to go back to the beginning in Eden,
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:08.100]   you have got to go back into eternity, before the world was ever made. And there you will
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:14.340]   see this great alignment of forces, good and evil, light and darkness, God and the devil
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:22.140]   and their forces. Now all that is made perfectly clear.
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:30.180]   There is one other thing that I mention. It is not quite so clear. It is partly speculative.
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.500]   But I mention it because it may have a very great significance, and it certainly does
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:43.140]   help one's understanding of certain problems and certain aspects of the Christian faith.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:49.220]   There are those who believe that this great cataclysmic event which took place in that
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:32:03.380]   pre-cosmic fall, when the devil and the angels fell, involved also an original material creation.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:11.460]   And they say that it helps them to understand the second verse in the Bible. Let me read
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:15.540]   it to you. I will read the first two verses of Genesis.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:21.020]   In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. That is verse one.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:33.020]   Verse two, And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:40.540]   the deep. And the deep there really means the chaos. The earth was without form and
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:48.260]   void. Darkness was upon the face of the deep. It is a description of a state of chaos.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:56.340]   Well now, this is the idea, the speculation. That before this cosmos that you and I are
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:03.380]   aware of, there was an original creation. That verse one in Genesis is really a reference
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:10.180]   to the great original. It is a general statement that God has made everything. Then they say
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:17.340]   that God had made a world, a cosmos, in which these angelic principalities and powers, they
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:23.180]   lived and they functioned and they dwelt. But when they fell in their rebellion and
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:32.260]   pride and disobedience, God punished their universe also. And it was reduced to a state
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:41.140]   of chaos. So that what is described in Genesis is the restoration, the recreation of this
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:48.980]   original creation which had got into a state of chaos and of darkness. Now I say that this
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:55.660]   is something about which we cannot be certain. And that this is more or less a speculation,
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:34:02.540]   but I think there is a great deal to be said for it. I cannot imagine God's act of creation
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:10.380]   passing through a chaotic state at any point at all. I cannot believe that. I cannot believe
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:17.860]   that God's creation as made by God was in any stage a kind of abyss, a void, a chaos.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.580]   Oh no, that doesn't fit in with God's work. Look at it in creation, look at it in
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:28.140]   nature, look at it everywhere. Every step and stage is characterized by that same perfection
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:33.740]   of form. Inquiet perhaps, underdeveloped, not yet perfect, but it's all right at its
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:39.660]   particular stage. It's never chaotic. The most rudimentary form, the most embryonic
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:44.940]   form is never chaotic. There's never this sense of void, but we are told that the Spirit
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:56.460]   brooded upon this chaos, this deep. So it may very well be true. And if it is true,
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:02.220]   you see, it provides a very complete answer to the people who say that they don't believe
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:07.740]   the book of Genesis because of the findings of the geologists who are looking at nature
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:12.700]   and at the material universe say, "But look here, there's evidence here that these rocks
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:18.620]   or these formations have existed for millennia." Very well, they may be right, they may be
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:23.540]   wrong. We mustn't believe everything even a geologist says. But even granting that they're
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:29.540]   right, the answer may be that all that they're discovering is just the result of that great
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:37.700]   original catastrophe when with the fall of the angels and of the devil, there was also
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:46.980]   this punishment of the whole universe in this destruction, this chaos that resulted. I don't
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:52.180]   emphasize that, I just put it to you for your consideration. However, the thing that we
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:58.500]   must be clear about is this, that there before the cosmos as we know it now was this tremendous
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:06.620]   event and you've got your powers and forces of evil. The next step is this one. God creating
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:15.220]   the world as you and I now know it, I mean by that God creating this present cosmos,
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:23.300]   what is described there in the first chapter of Genesis. And God made it perfect, as all
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:31.220]   God's works are perfect, God made it perfect. Everything was perfect, men included. So here
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:38.580]   is a perfect creation, paradise. God looked upon it all and saw that it was good and God
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:45.220]   was pleased and was satisfied with it. There is God's perfect world and all was harmony
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:54.060]   and peace and men living in fellowship with God. But then the question arises, well then
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:59.500]   if that was so, how is the world as we see it now? And you're familiar with the answer,
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:06.020]   aren't you? Oh yes, God has made this and he delights in it, he sees it's good. But
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:11.260]   the forces of evil, the devil and the fallen angels and the principalities and powers with
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:16.700]   their evil desire and their unhealthy ambition and their hatred of God, they look upon it
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:24.100]   and they're determined to destroy it. So the devil came and tempted the woman and through
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:34.500]   the woman the man. In other words, the fall of men. Everything that we have described
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:40.380]   in the third chapter of the book of Genesis, that's precisely what it's saying. Evil
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:45.260]   didn't start there, it was already there. The devil satan came in taking the guise of
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:50.980]   a serpent. But it was he who did it. And we see his object, it's against God. And man
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:55.980]   of course is the object now of attack because he's God's perfect creation. And God has
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:00.500]   made man in his own image and he's made man Lord of creation. He is the governor of
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:06.740]   the world. But the devil came in and he tempted him and men responded and he fell. What's
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:12.380]   the result? Well now the results of the fall of course are endless. I'm simply concerned
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:19.620]   to emphasize one particular aspect on this occasion. It's this. That men by listening
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:27.980]   to the devil became the slave of the devil. He became a citizen of the devil's kingdom.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:34.700]   He got under the power of the devil. And so you will find the devil described in the Bible
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:40.020]   as the God of this world. The prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:47.260]   in the children of disobedience. This is the result of man's fall. He has put himself
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:54.620]   under the power of the devil and his evil agencies. He belongs to the devil. Now the
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:59.900]   Bible is full of these descriptions. You remember Saul of Tarsus meeting our Lord on the road
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:04.020]   to Damascus and being commissioned to go and do his work. What was he told to do? He said
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:08.780]   I'm sending you to be a minister and a witness unto the people. What for? Well he says to
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:15.940]   open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:23.100]   God. The implication is that as they are, they're under the power of Satan. And so it's
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:27.540]   not surprising that when Paul comes to write to the Colossians he says this, "Who hath
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:33.980]   delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:41.980]   dear Son." Man is in the kingdom of darkness. He's in the kingdom of the devil. He's
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:48.500]   under the power of the devil. Under the dominion of sin. Sin shall not have dominion over you,
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:53.260]   says Paul to Christians. It had dominion over you before you became Christians. Or listen
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.940]   to our Lord's description again which I quoted last Sunday. He said, "When a strongman
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:05.980]   armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace." Now that is the Lord Jesus Christ's
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:11.780]   description of the world apart from himself. The strongman armed, here's the devil. What's
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:17.780]   the world? His palace. The goods, he keepeth his goods in peace. Who's that? Mankind as
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:25.900]   the result of sin. So the terrible consequence of the fall was, you see, that man, he's
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:31.060]   not himself any longer. He's a slave of the devil. He's the goods of the strongman
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:36.580]   armed. He's under the power and the dominion of Satan and sin and evil. Take the Apostle
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:42.620]   John's description of it again. In the first epistle, chapter 5, verse 19, he says, "Ye
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:51.260]   are of God little children, and the whole world lieth in that wicked one." What a terrible
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:58.300]   description. The whole world apart from Christian people is in the embrace of the wicked one,
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:04.220]   is in the arms of Satan. He's got them and he's holding them and he's dominating
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:12.580]   over the whole of their life. That's what the Bible tells us about the origin of evil
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:22.220]   and of sin. That's why man is as he is, you see. That pre-cosmic fall led to the cosmic
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:27.380]   fall, the fall of man. And what's the result? The whole course of man's history, the whole
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:34.220]   of his story has been entirely changed. Man, from the moment he fell through listening
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:41.780]   to Satan, is no longer free. He's the slave of Satan. He's the underling of the God
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:49.260]   of this world. He is no longer the Lord of creation. He is mastered by these things and
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:54.020]   in many senses their servant, yet though he still has great ability, he's the victim
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.780]   of his own forces. "Ah, but you say, look, he split the atom." I know, but he's
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:03.060]   the slave of the atomic power, isn't he? You see, the whole position has been reversed.
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:08.060]   Man has lost his freedom. He is no longer the Lord of creation. He is the slave of the
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:16.460]   devil and of hell. So that you have to realize that the real problem of the world this morning
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:24.980]   is only rarely and truly understood in the light of this great spiritual conflict between
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:34.540]   God and the devil. So the problem confronting us is not what can be done to man. And that's
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:39.340]   why acts of Parliament are not going to solve our problem, nor international conferences.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:43.100]   At the back of men there's something else. There are these unseen powers. It's the
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.220]   devil. Man's merely the instrument that's being used. He's the pawn upon the table,
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:54.860]   as it were. But it's at the back of men you see these other forces. The forces that
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:43:03.180]   are determined to produce a state of chaos, to upset God's universe. And there, then,
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:11.780]   I say, is the starting point of all our considerations. We wrestle not against flesh and blood. We
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:16.940]   can deal with men because they're of like powers with ourselves. But we wrestle not
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:21.780]   against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the world rulers of
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:28.620]   this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places. And the devil, my friends,
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:34.620]   is infinitely more powerful than we are. Read your Old Testament. He's defeated every
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:40.020]   saint, every patriarch, every prophet. There is none righteous, no, not one. All have sinned
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:44.460]   and come short of the glory of God. No man has ever been able to stand up against the
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:53.060]   devil. He's too powerful. He is this bright spirit, son of the morning, Lucifer. Great
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:58.780]   in his power, great in his understanding, great in his authority, great in the forces
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:05.380]   which he can marshal. That's the position. And man is helpless in his hands. Strong man
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:14.660]   on keepeth his goods in peace. Very well, we've got to leave it at that for this morning.
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:21.700]   But there, in a sense, you see, is the introduction to this matter. Now we have seen what's at
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:26.820]   the back of it all and how it's all come into being. But we shall have to go on, of
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:32.180]   course, to consider what these powers and forces are doing in detail, so that we may
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:38.420]   see how this wisdom of theirs and this power and understanding and brilliance and authority
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:45.500]   and ability, how all that is actually used in practice against nations, against individuals,
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:51.860]   the great problem of evil and man fighting these powers as he passes through this world.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:58.980]   Now then, there, I say, is the introduction to it all. You must have faced the problem
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:04.460]   of the origin of evil. You don't think if you haven't faced that. We are meant to think,
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:09.740]   my friends, and the Bible encourages us to and it helps us to, and it has its explanation.
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:15.140]   There is the origin of it all. Don't start with man, don't start even with the world.
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:26.700]   Go back, go back beyond it. In the heavenly places, the original calamity took place.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:38.140]   And the world is but the chosen scene of this mighty battle between God and the devil. Is
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:43.540]   this discouraging? Well, as I said last Sunday morning in closing, I say again, far from
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:50.540]   discouraging, I find it to be most encouraging, because now I understand what's happening.
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:46:00.540]   But still more I know this, that the Lord reigneth, he's over all, and he has sent somebody
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:05.300]   into this world who has been able to master the strongman armed and to rob him of his
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:17.460]   armor. The Christian not only is aware of the forces arranged against him, he is one
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:23.940]   who is able to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. He can put on the
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:32.660]   whole armor of God. And though he is fighting Lucifer, star of the morning, the devil, principalities
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:43.700]   and powers, he can stand and continue to stand and be finally more than conqueror. May God
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:49.220]   give us grace and wisdom to consider these things, to meditate upon them, that we may
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:57.780]   take unto ourselves the whole armor of God, that we may be able to stand in the evil day
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:10.140]   and having done all things, to stand. Amen.
