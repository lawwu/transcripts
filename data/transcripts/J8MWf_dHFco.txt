[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Pastor John, you're coming off a six-week writing leave, and last time you talked to
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.720]   us about what you have learned about the writing process, especially at the conceptual and
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.040]   research levels in the early stages of the process.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.380]   Now talk to us about writing itself.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.840]   How does this work for you, and what lessons can you share with us writers from this recent
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.000]   six-week writing leave?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.960]   Right, so I've got 15 things that I learned, and seven of them last time, and we didn't
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.080]   even get to the point of writing yet, but dealt with that really frustrating stage,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:48.760]   for me anyway, of doodling and trying to conceptualize and trying to organize, and it is a very frustrating
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.380]   time.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.000]   What gets the breakthrough for me, and it did this time, it has every time, is number
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.920]   eight, start writing.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.040]   I said last time, pick one subtopic in the big topic of your book, and put down some
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.720]   general ideas underneath it that you might tackle, and now I'm saying, start writing
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.520]   on that subtopic.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:20.140]   Under God and His guiding work by the Spirit, the actual process of writing is the most
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.400]   important guide to how you're going to conceive your book.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.000]   I know that sounds backwards to people.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   They think, "God, I can say first."
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.840]   The actual process of writing is the most important key to the door of knowing what
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.480]   you think about this topic.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.600]   People think they get that backwards.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:52.480]   The actual process of writing is the most important portal by which new light shines
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.880]   into your mind on the topic.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.280]   So you discover by writing, you see by writing, you understand by writing, you conceptualize
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280]   by writing.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.760]   I mean, conceptualize the structure of what you're going to do by writing.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.760]   One of the biggest mistakes, I think, people make at every stage on this is they think
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.720]   that discovery, seeing, understanding, conceptualizing must come before the writing.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.920]   That is paralyzing, and it fails to see that writing is a revelatory act.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.640]   It doesn't just record what you've thought.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.120]   It is thinking.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.640]   It is, and it's the most effective way to think because there it is in front of you,
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.160]   and now you're not jumbled when you're three sentences into it.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.120]   So that's number eight, maybe the most important thing I say.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:56.040]   Number nine, since new ideas and issues and questions are always coming as you write,
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.880]   keep another file or sheet going to bullet those ideas.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.740]   So I did that on the computer.
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.720]   As I'm writing, I've got underneath this Word document another document called Ideas,
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.560]   and I'm flipping back and forth all the time, jotting down ideas that later could be dealt
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.240]   with because when I write, my mind just becomes fertile, and until I write, it is one big
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.960]   mess.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:29.140]   Number 10, as you write by hand or by computer, say out loud what you are writing.
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.400]   This will help you write for the ear.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.600]   Even if readers don't read your book out loud, and most of them won't, I know that, most
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:46.920]   people, not everybody, but most people unconsciously hear your words in their head.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.360]   That's the way most people read, and you're writing for most people.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:58.520]   If those words that you have on paper flow with effective sound and rhythm and pacing
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:06.280]   and cadence and balance and parallels and images, then the act of reading will be clearer
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.320]   and much more enjoyable.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.000]   I don't know any way to write like that without writing out loud.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.200]   I talk to guys who are writing sermons all the time because when they give the sermons
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.800]   or read the sermons, I say, "You don't talk like that, and you don't even know what you're
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.600]   doing until you hear yourself doing it."
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.960]   That's number 10.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:36.440]   Number 11, when you have said all you can on that first subtopic, stop and pick out
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.360]   another subtopic to write on.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.720]   Make a few idea lists and then get going on that.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.000]   Don't worry whether, "Well, is this going to be chapter 2 or 13?"
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.240]   It doesn't really matter where it's going to fit.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.560]   Just write what you know next about this issue, and what will happen is over time, the ideas
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.360]   for how to put the pieces together will emerge.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:05.000]   Number 12, you may be three weeks into the project, like me, writing every day before
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.360]   you have a clear sense of what the focus of the book is going to be.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.540]   For me, it was longer than three weeks.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.760]   It took me almost to the end of six weeks before I gave up on my initial conception.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.240]   Gave it up and said, "Okay, that is the book I intended to write.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.720]   It's not the book I'm going to write.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.240]   I'm going to get rid of that idea and do what I'm really doing."
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.400]   That's number 12.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.440]   Number 13, feel free to track down some sources or read a bit about something you're writing
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.680]   about, but beware of this.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.560]   I'm talking about pausing in the writing to do some research.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.560]   Beware of this.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.080]   It's a great book killer.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.720]   Perfectionists rarely write books.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.440]   They're too busy reading everything.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.640]   Realize that your book will be one small contribution.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.040]   Humble yourself.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.760]   You're not writing the final book, and that's a great liberator.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:09.840]   No book says it all, so don't suspend your writing indefinitely while you research something
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.120]   to have the last word on it.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.520]   Here, I really should put in a qualifier because I'm not talking about major scholarly books.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.520]   I know that if you're writing a major scholarly book and you're bumping up to an issue that's
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.120]   just got to be dealt with, you may have to spend weeks researching that and figuring
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.120]   that out.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.600]   I'm not talking about that kind of major scholarly work.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:39.040]   Number 14, as your idea list grows from all that's coming into your head as you write,
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.360]   don't be paralyzed by focusing on it and saying, "No way will I ever be able to deal with all
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.840]   those issues that are coming to my mind."
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.320]   Stay focused on what you're writing and then do another topic.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:07:01.840]   I love the image that a big, big, big tree will fall over with chop, chop, chop, chop,
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.560]   a thousand chops, and the focus is, "Can I sink the ax in this time just as good as I
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.560]   can sink it?
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.040]   And tomorrow, I'm sinking it again.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.760]   And the next day, I'm sinking it again."
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.680]   That tree's going to fall if you have the discipline to keep doing what's in front of
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.680]   you.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:25.280]   And lastly, number 15, expect divine serendipity in answer to your prayers.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:34.440]   For example, I happened to be listening totally randomly to a podcast by Andrew Walls, a mission
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:40.840]   scholar at the University of Edinburgh, as I was writing the book about the Bible, and
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:49.120]   he was talking about how Christianity crosses cultures, and in doing so, more of Christ
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.480]   is seen in new cultures than the old cultures saw.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:59.240]   Therefore, the very spread of Christianity is the revelation of more about Christ in
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.240]   the Word.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:07.440]   That just blew me away, and it found its way immediately right into the thing I was writing
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.400]   because it was so relevant for how we know Christ through the Scriptures.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.560]   So did I plan that?
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.800]   God planned that.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:25.880]   And God has plans for people who are trying to honor His Word, stay true, be faithful,
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.440]   help the church, advance the mission.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.320]   So that's what I learned, Tony.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.640]   Those are my 15.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.640]   Excellent.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   Those are very helpful, Pastor John.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.360]   Good rhythm and pacing and cadence is certainly my greatest challenge, and it seems that
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.280]   the poets have an unfair advantage.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.960]   Well, just say it out loud.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.960]   You'll hear it.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.960]   Wonderful.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.960]   Thank you.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.760]   But our listeners are asking, "We still have not talked about the book you just wrote."
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.000]   We need to do that, and we can and we will on Monday.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.480]   Until then, be sure to check out the Ask Pastor John apps for the Apple and Android devices
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.960]   for our recent episodes that you may have missed, and you can also go to our landing

[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.520]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.880]   Have a wonderful weekend.
