[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   From Joel, "I'm getting the recommended eight hours of sleep every night, but constantly
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.120]   feel exhausted both when I wake up and throughout the day.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.040]   I've been watching videos on the importance of limiting screen time before bed and I think
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.160]   I may be a culprit for my bad sleep.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.200]   Do you have any advice on ways to reduce screen time before bed as I find it very addicting
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.520]   and hard to break that habit?"
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.800]   I love the irony of watching videos about how to reduce screen time.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.560]   I imagine him, Joel, up late, late into the night watching videos about how to not watch
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.200]   videos before bed.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.420]   All sorts of contradictions and irony in the online productivity space as the channels
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.240]   are exactly the causes of productivity issues in the first place.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.040]   All right, Joel, a couple of things here.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.120]   I mean, first of all, of course, if you're tired throughout the day and you're getting
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.600]   enough sleep, if you actually are getting enough sleep, go back to the opening segment
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.280]   of the show, make sure that you're not excessively context shifting.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.880]   Some of that tiredness may actually be mental fatigue and not actual rundown tiredness.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.160]   So you want to just set up your day to be less unnecessarily exhausting, but if we're
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.680]   going to focus specifically on this issue of your sleep being disrupted, I mean, I agree
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.740]   that good sleep hygiene can help and going on to, I think the right way to think about
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.540]   it is highly salient, highly distracting, highly arousing content should not be consumed
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.780]   near bed.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.640]   So anything where it's coming through an app that makes money by how much time you look
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.640]   at it, avoiding that, I think is important.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.400]   So you should not go on YouTube before bed.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.840]   You should not go on to Instagram or Twitter or TikTok.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.320]   Anything that's attention engineered is going to be a problem because, again, these services,
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.960]   those services work services you don't pay to use work by getting you to look at the
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960]   service longer.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.580]   So they're going to be pressing buttons within your brain to get a response that makes you
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.080]   very engaged and aroused emotionally and wanting to actually come back and keep watching more.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.640]   That's not a great state to be in if you want to go to bed.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.960]   So if you're going to be looking at a screen before bed, a general rule of thumb here is
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.940]   look at things where they don't make money off of you spending more time on it.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.840]   So if there's a The Office on Peacock, like I watch an episode or two of The Office because
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.120]   it's comforting and it's dumb, that's going to have much less of a negative impact, right?
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.200]   These streaming services make money by you paying a subscription fee, so they want to
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.920]   make sure there's stuff on there you like, but they don't particularly care if you binge
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.120]   for seven hours in a row or not, they're just, here's, we have a bunch of shows we think
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.120]   you'll like.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.580]   So there's a real difference.
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.720]   They both seem like screens, but watching a comforting, somewhat boring show could actually
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.560]   help your brain calm down in a way that watching TikTok videos or following YouTube recommendations
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.220]   might actually get your brain fired up.
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.100]   So the intent of the platform, is it an engagement or is it customer experience, makes a difference
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.640]   on how it's going to affect your sleep.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.480]   The other thing I want to throw in here, that's sort of the curve ball, is another common
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.140]   sleep disruptor is not necessarily what you do right before bed, but what's happening
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.880]   inside your head.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.040]   If your head is keeping track of a lot of open loops, to use a term from David Allen,
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.640]   tasks that you're responsible for, projects you need to work on, ideas that might lead
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.120]   to cool opportunities.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.420]   If you have a lot of these things that exist primarily in your head, and if you forget
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.620]   about them, it's going to be a problem.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.060]   Your brain is going to have a hard time falling asleep because it feels like the juggler where
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.580]   the things it's juggling are very fragile and valuable and doesn't want to drop anything,
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.900]   so it has to keep moving.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.700]   So ironically, one of the biggest things you can do to help you sleep at night is be better
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.120]   about how you control your work during the day, being better about how you shut down
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.240]   your work at the end of the day.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.840]   Organizational systems that are built around notions like full capture and planning.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.800]   So every task that you need to do that you've committed to is captured in a trusted location
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.360]   that you review regularly, so your brain doesn't have to keep track of it.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.280]   It makes a huge difference for your sleep.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.280]   Multiscale planning.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.760]   I have a plan for my season, which gets turned into plans for my week, which gets turned
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.680]   into plans for my day, so that my brain doesn't have to just keep thinking, "Hey, what am
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   I working on?
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.680]   What should I be working on?
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.700]   Should I be thinking more about this or that?"
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.720]   Helps you sleep.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.280]   Having in general a good shutdown routine.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.800]   Okay, the day is over.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.480]   Before I shut down work, let me check all of the inboxes, my email, my plan, making
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.360]   sure that everything has a place, anything that came up has been written down.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.640]   I know what's happening tomorrow.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.320]   There's nothing I need to be keeping track of.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.320]   We have a good plan.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.320]   Everything's captured.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   Great.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.560]   I can check that shutdown complete checkbox in my time block planner or have a ritual
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.600]   or phrase I say, and so later, if my mind starts to get ruminative about work, I can
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.600]   say, "No, no, no.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.520]   I checked that checkbox in my time block planner.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.520]   I said that phrase.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.560]   That means I successfully reviewed and shut down all open loops.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.480]   I don't have to worry about things till tomorrow."
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.080]   That makes a big difference for sleep.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.640]   All right, so to summarize, we have a couple different things going on here.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.400]   Be careful about what screens you expose yourself to before bed.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.480]   It's probably going to be easier if you have a bedtime screen habit to just change what
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.560]   you look at than it will be to just cold turkey stop looking at a screen before bed.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.200]   Just shift your screens to things that's not emotionally salient or emotionally arousing.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.880]   And then care a lot about how you organize your work, open loops, shutdowns, and multi-scale
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.880]   planning.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.400]   And finally, make sure that some of your daytime exhaustion is not actually from context shifting
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.960]   as opposed to sleep disruption.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.200]   Those are my three points, Joel.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.160]   I think all three of those things combined will make a difference.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.720]   I'm noticing, Jesse, we got, not only do we have a bunch of J names in a row, but the
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.880]   next name is literally JJ.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.880]   It's as if we go through our questions alphabetically.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.880]   I like it.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.440]   Unfortunately, it's the last of the J names.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.440]   I wish we had more.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.240]   But anyways, let's get, after John and Joel, let's get rolling with what JJ has to ask
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.240]   us.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.240]   Yep.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.080]   So JJ has to say, "I'm constantly feeling stressed during the evenings when I'm not
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.520]   at work because I feel like I'm wasting time.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.560]   I want to constantly be improving myself, but I also want to take time to do fun things,
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.400]   video games, see friends, et cetera.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   What should I do?"
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   Right.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.160]   So this could be an issue for people who care a lot about productivity writ large is evenings
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.160]   can be stressful.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:31.480]   It can be stressful because if you're not doing anything structured, you feel just unnerved.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.640]   You practice multi-scale planning.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.480]   Your workday is time block planned.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.380]   It's connected to a weekly plan and a seasonal plan, and it can feel unnerving to be just
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.960]   around, feel unproductive.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.420]   But then you're worried about like, well, what do I want to do is if I treat my day
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.480]   like my workday, that's exhausting because it's also really hard to be very structured
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.480]   during the workday.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.440]   So this can be in a dilemma like JJ is in as well.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.640]   So the two things I recommend in this situation is one, clear separation between work and
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.640]   non-work.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   Okay.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.560]   So clear shutdown routine.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.640]   We just talked about this in the answer that I gave to Joel in the previous question.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.960]   So you really can shut down work.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.440]   That'll help your mind leave the work productivity mindset of we are constantly trying to keep
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.960]   track of what's going on and making sure nothing's being misplaced and we're making good use
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.960]   of your time.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.960]   You want to clear shutdown.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.440]   So your mindset can shift.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:29.200]   But the second thing I would advise is that especially if you're an organized person,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.400]   having no plan is overrated.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.760]   We often tell ourselves that the solution to maybe the exhaustion we feel from work
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.760]   is nothingness.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:47.680]   The goal is if I could just have nothing to do, then no plan, no intention.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.800]   That will be the opposite of being, having too much to do and I'm going to find relaxation
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.480]   and rejuvenation actually does not work that way for a lot of people.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.880]   Especially if you're organized, having nothing to do, having no plan is stressful and you
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.720]   get that unnerving feeling that you talk about.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.160]   So what's the right thing to do?
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.520]   Sketch a plan, but make sure that plan is varied and rejuvenating and interesting.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.560]   The problem that people have, what stresses us out about work is not the fact that we
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.640]   have things to do.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.320]   It's not the fact that we have a plan.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.800]   It's just that we have too many things to switch back and forth behind us because the
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   work is hard.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.800]   The work is stressful.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   It's not the plan itself.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.480]   It's what the plan is actually is in the plan.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.960]   Work is hard.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.360]   You sketch a plan after you're shut down.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.180]   It shouldn't be a detailed time block plan and be like, yeah, I want to get a reading
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.160]   session in and work out and then why don't we watch this show with the kids that I've
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.160]   been reading about?
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.880]   I think it's going to be special and I want to make sure that I have a, go for a walk
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.880]   before we get ready for bed.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.080]   You sort of sketch a plan of things that are meaningful and useful for the family and useful
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.720]   for yourself and varied and rejuvenating, and it's not a tight minute by minute plan.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.200]   You're actually going to feel much better about that.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:59.720]   So again, the key to get away from the stress of a busy work day is not to significantly
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.560]   reduce what you do.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.120]   It's not the significantly reduce the idea of having a plan is to make the things you
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.720]   do much better, to make the things that you've planned to do fun or interesting or useful
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.600]   to the world beyond the world of work and completely unconnected.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.200]   So shut down work, shift to non-work mode, but then say, I want to hit the pillow proud
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.200]   tonight.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.040]   Like what do I want to do with my time that makes this an evening that I'm proud of?
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.840]   And it has nothing to do with productivity.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.960]   It's not how do I achieve this or get ahead of this?
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.080]   It's like, how do I like get time to read this book I really like?
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.880]   How do I get some one-on-one time with like my oldest son who I haven't seen recently?
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:41.760]   You want to make intentional use of your time, which is separate from some notion of optimizing
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.920]   time or maximizing output.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.760]   So doing little can be stressful.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.400]   I mean, that's the, there's so many books, Jesse, there's a while where do nothing, how
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   to do nothing.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.400]   The art of doing nothing.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.560]   It was this whole notion of what we need to do is nothing.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.560]   Doing nothing stresses a lot of people out.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.160]   Like humans don't like to do nothing.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160]   Because people are like really afraid of being bored.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.600]   And boredom is actually a useful human emotion, right?
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:12.120]   We feel such a strong, distasteful, uh, emotional reaction that doing nothing is because we're
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.560]   evolved to actually want to be doing things.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.240]   That's what drives humans to unlike a cat who's completely happy.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.060]   If I can lay in the sun for seven hours and I'm a cat, it's a good day, right?
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.720]   Cats don't get bored.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.400]   Humans do, but that is the drive that's like, okay, well, what else are we going to do?
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.400]   Well, I don't know.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.840]   Let's invent fire or organize a political system or invent religion.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.240]   Like the boredom is part of what drove humans that take advantage of this larger brain that
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.240]   we grew.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.680]   So, you know, we shouldn't, boredom is important indicator.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.600]   The key is, I mean, again, people are not stressed out by doing things, they're stressed
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.040]   out by what they're doing.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.840]   The reasonableness of what they're doing, whether they have enough time to do it, the,
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.160]   the actual demands of the work they're doing.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160]   That's what's stressful.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.160]   Not the doing itself.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:03.200]   I mean, you can stop your work and be reading and woodworking and, you know, movies and
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.400]   watching sports, all sorts of things you can do, which are things, but they're very different
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   than work.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.040]   It's really the content of activity.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.840]   Not so much the, uh, planning around activity.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.560]   Planning itself is not too stressful.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.040]   Actually Lex had, um, Yuval Harari on like a couple weeks ago and I listened to that.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.680]   They were talking about like civilization and boredom and stuff like that.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.680]   Oh, interesting.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.240]   Yuval is real big on, um, the conceptual, the cognitive conceptual developments in human
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.240]   evolution that just unlocked everything.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.240]   I'll listen to that one.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   It was just before the Isaacson one.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.240]   I think.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.440]   Um, I saw someone the other day attribute sapiens to me.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.440]   That's pretty good.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   They said Cal Newport's book sapiens.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.800]   I sold like millions and millions of copies.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.800]   I was like, I like that.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   I suppose.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.600]   I mean, it's probably bad news for Yuval Harari, but I guess good news for me.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.880]   I was like, I'll take it.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.880]   I'll take it.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.360]   Hey, if you liked this video, I think you'll really like this one as well.
