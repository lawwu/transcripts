[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   The following recording in the Great Biblical Doctrine series by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.800]   was originally recorded on paper tape, which has unfortunately deteriorated over the years.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.320]   We have now restored this using digital technology, but unfortunately some background
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.720]   interference does remain. We do apologize for this and hope that it doesn't spoil
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.200]   your enjoyment of this study in the Book of Revelation by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.720]   Most of you remember probably that we are engaged at the moment in a general interpretation of the
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:43.600]   Book of Revelation. I say a general interpretation because it is not my purpose, nor my plan,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:52.640]   nor my idea to go into all the various details. That would obviously take a long time and it would
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.920]   be thoroughly inappropriate in a series which are called Biblical Doctrines. But it is rather
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.520]   important that we should have a general understanding of the teaching of this book,
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:13.600]   because without that our ideas with regard to the second coming of our Lord and the main
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.200]   events in connection with it cannot possibly be clear. So we are engaged in this general
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.920]   consideration of the message of the book. I can summarize what I have said so far more or
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:38.000]   less like this. We have suggested that the book consists of a series of seven revelations or
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.840]   visions, each one parallel to the other, each in a sense dealing with the same thing from a slightly
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.120]   different standpoint and aspect. We are suggesting that the theme is the history of the Christian
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.520]   Church from the first coming of our Lord to his second coming, and that different aspects of the
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:10.000]   history of that period are herein revealed. We further suggested that you can have a major
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.960]   division of the book into two parts, that the first eleven chapters constitute one part,
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:25.840]   and the second eleven chapters another part, and that the division represents something which is
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.520]   of great importance for us to understand. In the first section, chapters one to eleven,
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:40.160]   you are given an account of the conflict of the Lord Jesus Christ and his Church against men,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:49.200]   against human instruments, human beings that are opposed and antagonistic. You are told something
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.160]   of the nature of the conflict and how it ends in the victory and the conquest of the Lord.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.480]   In the second section, chapters twelve to twenty-two, we are given an account of the same
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:10.000]   conflict but on a deeper level. There we are told that we wrestle not rarely against flesh and blood,
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.920]   but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.320]   against spiritual wickedness in high places. In other words, we are shown that the conflict of
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:31.120]   the Lord Jesus Christ and the Church is ultimately a conflict with the devil and with his agencies
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.640]   and associates and assistants. Now then, having given a broad division like that,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.320]   we then went back last Friday night to a little more detailed consideration
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.280]   of the contents of the two sections. We looked at what we had told in chapters one, two, and three,
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.600]   and in chapters four to seven. At that point we had to break off last Friday evening.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.560]   We were given that first picture of the Lord Jesus Christ in the Church,
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:15.120]   and the various states and spiritual conditions of the Church at any time in our history,
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.800]   in any age. That is what you get in the first three chapters.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:25.440]   Then I suggested that in chapters four to seven, having had that great scene in heaven in chapters
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:34.000]   four and five, you come to the opening of the seals of the book, the opening being done by
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.800]   the Lord Jesus Christ himself, who is the Lord of history. I suggested that in the opening of the
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:51.760]   seals we are given a picture and a prophecy of the opposition that God's people encounter in
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.360]   this life and in this world, because they are God's people, because they are Christ's people.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.480]   I gave you some suggestions as to the detailed interpretation.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:12.480]   Forces are arrayed against them. The apostle Paul tells Timothy, "Yea, and all that live godly in
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:19.920]   Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." Here it is prophesied in this book, and it has actually
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.440]   come to pass. It was already happening when John had his vision and when he wrote his book.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.440]   So it is meant to encourage us and to comfort us. You remember the picture of the souls under the
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.240]   altar crying out, "How long, O Lord?" Then how in the sixth seal we were given the answer,
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.280]   "There is a judgment coming, and it will be terrible. These persons who have opposed God's
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.320]   people will cry out to the rocks and the mountains to fall upon them and to hide them
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:58.880]   from the wrath of the Lamb." Well, very well. Then we saw that the redeemed are all the time safe
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.760]   because God knows his perfect number of people, the 144,000. He has already chosen them. They
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.280]   are known unto him. "The foundation of God standeth sure," says Paul again to Timothy,
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.840]   "having this seal. The Lord knoweth them that are his." It is all right. Nothing shall be able
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.200]   to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.600]   Now then, we come to the second subsection of this first major section.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:38.160]   That is the section which runs from chapter 8 to the end of chapter 11.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:46.480]   And the most important section it is. This is the so-called section that deals with the trumpets,
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.480]   the sounding of the trumpets. No longer the seals, but the trumpets.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.480]   The seventh seal, in a sense, introduces the trumpet series.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:05.600]   And this is more or less what we are told. First of all, we are given a picture of the prayer of
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:14.800]   the saints ascending up to God. Yes, but not in and of themselves and not alone. The incense
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:22.240]   which is provided by the Lord Jesus Christ himself is added to them so that as you and I pray,
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:30.240]   our prayers are covered by the incense of the Lord himself and so are presentable to God.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:37.920]   Our prayers go through him, through the incense of his person and of his perfect work.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.760]   Then after that, it is interesting to notice the sequence. It is as the result, as it were,
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:54.960]   of our prayers to God that the trumpet series begin. You find this in the eighth chapter.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:02.320]   Now, there are certain things which are important to observe about this trumpet series.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.000]   You will notice that what happened as the result of the blowing of the trumpets
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:16.080]   only affected a third part all along of the various things that were affected. For instance,
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.360]   we read, "The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood,
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.400]   and they were cast upon the earth, and a third part of trees was burnt up,
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.200]   and all green grass was burnt up." It is the same with the others. "A third part of the sea,
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:38.640]   and a third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and a third part of the ships, etc."
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.160]   "A third part of the rivers, and of the fountains, and so on."
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:50.800]   Now, that is important for this reason, that what happens under this trumpet series is not total.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:58.480]   It is only partial. We must bear that in mind because when we come to consider the
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:05.600]   series in connection with the seals in chapter 16, we shall find that the same things were
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.120]   affected in a total manner. No longer a third, but the whole. But here under the trumpets,
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:17.440]   it is only a third. Now, what does this trumpet series represent?
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:27.040]   Well, surely there can be no question at all about this. Here we are told what happens to the people
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:40.000]   who persecute Christ's people. Under the seals, we saw the things that the world men do to God's
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.560]   people. Now we are given a glimpse into what happens to them because they persecute God's
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:54.160]   people. A trumpet is a sound of warning. Trumpets always stand in the Scriptures for warning,
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.160]   a warning of judgment and a warning of punishment.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:05.280]   And I suggest to you that what we have in this whole trumpet series is an account, as I say,
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:12.720]   of what happens to those who are opposed to God and his Christ and opposed to the Church.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.320]   Now, I think there is very definite proof given of this
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:23.840]   towards the end of the ninth chapter. The trumpets are described in chapters eight and nine,
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.520]   but this is what we read at the end of the ninth chapter.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:35.200]   We read here, "And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues,
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:43.360]   yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:50.000]   of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood, which neither can see nor hear nor walk.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:57.360]   Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication,
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:03.920]   nor of their thefts." In other words, that is the summing up which we are given at the end
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:11.280]   of the trumpet series. In other words, the whole series has a reference to these godless people
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.720]   who are opposed to God and his Christ and the Church and Christ's people, Christian people.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.360]   And the interesting thing that we have to observe, therefore, is this,
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:27.680]   that all these things that are described here as happening to these people
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:37.120]   happen under the hand of God and under the hand of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:43.920]   Now, I emphasize that because I think that oftentimes, as Christian people, we fail to
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:50.000]   remember that. And we tend to think that the things that happen to the ungodly men and women
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.280]   in this world are more or less accidental or happen in the course of nature. They do not.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:01.280]   They happen very definitely as the result of an action taken by the Son of God.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:08.160]   It is he, as it were, who introduces these trumpets with their judgment and with their
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.880]   punishment, so that the things that happen to these people are ordained of God. What are they?
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.960]   Well, you notice that the first thing under the first trumpet is this.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:28.240]   Certain calamities happen in the earth. The first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire,
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.680]   always expressive of judgment, by the way, both hail and fire. You remember it happened at Sodom
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:41.680]   and Gomorrah when God judges a people. This is the picture, hail and fire. This is the judgment of
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:49.920]   God, hail and fire mingled with blood, still more expressive. They were cast upon the earth and a
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   third part of the trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up. Now, that is the symbolical
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:02.960]   way in which this book tells us that certain calamities are going to happen to these people.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:12.320]   The calamities that are sent by God. Now, that is the message and we must not fail to observe that.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.880]   The various calamities that happen, such as earthquakes,
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:25.040]   volcanoes, overflowing, and things like that, all these, according to the scripture,
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:33.280]   are under the hand of God. And it is a part of his way of punishing sin and of announcing and
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:40.240]   publishing to the world that it cannot treat his people with impunity and persecute them.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:45.680]   That he is the Lord and he will punish them for their actions. Let me give you an illustration.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:54.960]   There is no question at all but that this whole trumpet series is a kind of parallel to the plagues
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:02.560]   you remember with which Egypt was afflicted for its treatment of God's people, the children of Israel,
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:08.080]   before they went out in the Exodus. You go back and read your book of Exodus and you will find that
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.000]   God visited them with certain plagues to warn them, to say to them, "Let my people go."
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.200]   Pharaoh would not let his people go, so God visited them with these various plagues, which are very
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:25.440]   reminiscent of these. There was the preliminary warning and because they would not finally listen,
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:31.200]   destruction came upon them. The people of Israel were taken out and Pharaoh and his hosts were
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.680]   destroyed, you remember, in the Red Sea. Well now, this is exactly parallel to that.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:41.920]   And of course, this has been a simple effect of history ever since the first coming of our
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:48.320]   blessed Lord and Savior. The world of men has persecuted the church, oh yes, but things have
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:54.800]   been happening to the world of men. There have been calamities and pestilences, terrible events
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.520]   and happenings. Some of them happen in the earth, but some of them happen in the sea.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:07.040]   That's the second trumpet. Some of them happen in connection with rivers and springs. Certain
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:14.880]   plagues have been visited upon the world of men. Certain diseases have come from rivers polluted
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:21.200]   and springs polluted. And there have been floods and masses of people have been destroyed in that
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:28.000]   way. And these have been judgments of God upon the world. God has been punishing the sin of men,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.600]   and especially their sin of persecuting his saints and people.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:37.040]   Then you remember that we go on to the next, which is much more striking.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:43.440]   Having dealt in this way, the next, we are told, is something that happens in the skies.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.200]   The fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten,
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:56.800]   and so on, and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars, and the third part of
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.840]   them was darkened and the day shone not for a third part of it and the night likewise.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:09.120]   And this is no doubt again a way of describing how certain calamities have happened to men
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:16.880]   as the result of things happening in the skies. Meteors falling down upon the earth and consuming
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.920]   masses of people. There was a meteor reported the other day, you remember, as passing through the
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.120]   sky. A number of people saw it. It didn't fall to earth apparently, but they have fallen to earth
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.240]   in times past. And there have been terrible calamities that have visited the earth from
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:40.880]   the skies. Thunder and lightning and various other forms of calamities. Now these may be used and are
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:49.840]   used at times by God himself in order to punish a godless and a persecuting world. But then when
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:56.000]   you go on to the fifth trumpet, there is something again which in a sense is still more sinister.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:03.760]   Here we are told that to a certain angel was given the key of the bottomless pit. This is at the
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:10.160]   beginning of chapter nine. And he opened the bottomless pit and there rose a smoke out of the
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:16.400]   pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:25.600]   And out of it all there came some terrible locusts. What is this? Well this is what we sometimes speak
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:32.560]   of when we say that at certain periods of history it has been exactly as if hell had been let loose.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:42.560]   As if every restraint had gone and the devil and his forces were allowed to have free play
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:49.440]   amongst men and women in the world. Now the apostle Paul, you remember, teaches that same thing
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:57.040]   in his epistle to the Romans in the second half of that first chapter. He takes the history of
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:02.960]   the world and he tells us how because men began to worship the creatures rather than the creator,
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:10.080]   God gave them over to a reprobate mind. He withdrew his restraints. In other words,
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:16.160]   it's like this devil that opens the bottomless pit and allows the stench of hell to come up
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.000]   without any let or hindrance and it seems to cover the whole world.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.640]   And you remember what it results in. Read that second half of the first chapter of Romans.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:34.160]   Not only sin and immorality but those foul perversions, men lusting after men and women
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:40.160]   after women. God permitted it. God gave them over to a reprobate mind. This book of Revelation
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:47.360]   teaches the same thing. And if you read your history of the world since the Lord first
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:53.600]   came into this world, you will find that there have been periods like that when sin and vice
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:59.920]   and immorality and foulness have been rampant as it were and God's cause seemed to be hidden
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:10.080]   altogether. Yes, but remember, it is God who does it. And I think that there is nothing more
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   tremendous than the realization of this because we are undoubtedly living in such a period
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:22.960]   ourselves. Compare today with a hundred years ago. Compare today with but thirty years ago.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:31.680]   Doesn't it seem as if someone has opened the bottomless pit? You see it? Well, when you
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:37.600]   have your newspapers you see it in them day after day, these horrible foul things as if
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:44.000]   every restraint has gone and violence and crime are loosed and abroad throughout the
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.360]   whole world. But let us remember that that sometimes is something that is allowed and
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:58.240]   almost caused by God. He doesn't cause the sin but he allows it to go unrestrained in
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.200]   order that men might be punished and in order that they might come to their senses. And
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:10.880]   I have no hesitation in saying that the terrible moral problem of this century is undoubtedly
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:17.600]   God's punishment for the pride and the arrogance of men in the last century when they began
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.800]   to criticize this book and to pit themselves against God with their learning and their
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:29.520]   science and their politics and felt they could make a paradise without God. God is withdrawing
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:35.120]   the restraints in this century and we are seeing one of the occasions on which this
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:41.520]   particular fifth trumpet vision is being verified before our very eyes. That's the meaning
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:48.560]   of the fifth trumpet. And then you go on to your sixth trumpet and this is nothing but
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:56.640]   a picture of terrible wars. You read about the horses and about these things in their
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.640]   tales and all the rest of it. It's a most graphic picture all in symbolical form of
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:08.320]   course. Everything in this book is a matter of symbols and for people to interpret this
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:14.960]   about the horses or the pit or the locusts in a literal sense is rarely so pathetic as
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:21.120]   to be rarely tragic. These are all symbols and pictures. And remembering that it was
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:26.720]   a man writing in the first century AD, you can't imagine a more perfect description
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:32.840]   of a horrible war. It's almost a description of modern warfare with armaments, with tanks
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:39.200]   and plate armor over your machines and these various modern instruments of war. It's
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:45.440]   all suggested here in a symbolical manner. But it isn't referring to modern wars only.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:51.640]   It is referring to some of the terrible wars of the centuries which have wiped out such
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:57.820]   masses of men and women. And the thing that I'm impressing is this, that again the teaching
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:05.000]   is this, that these great wars which have brought such calamities to mankind are the
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.600]   punishment of God sometimes. It's God visiting the people who have persecuted his people.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.880]   You see the idea of men of the world always is if they can only get rid of God and of
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.480]   the church and of Christ, they can live their own life and do what they want to do. They're
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:28.720]   trying to get rid of him. But this is what happens. They begin fighting one another and
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:34.920]   they destroy one another in masses. And there have been terrible scenes on earth as the
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:41.920]   result of the great wars of history. They are a means whereby God punishes the sin of
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:52.080]   mankind. So that if you read this trumpet series in that way, I think you will be filled
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:59.560]   with great comfort. You will see that God is controlling everything. And I have no doubt
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:05.600]   in asserting, as I've repeatedly asserted from this pulpit, that the two world wars
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:12.040]   which we've had in this present century are to be explained only in this way. It wasn't
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:18.360]   the Kaiser, it wasn't Hitler. What a fatuous suggestion. It isn't a matter of politics
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:24.360]   or economic conditions. No, no, it's much bigger than that. It's God, I say, addressing
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:30.520]   mankind, punishing the world of men that will not listen to him. And yet you notice what
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:41.480]   we are told here at the very end? That in spite of all this, men will still not repent.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:47.880]   And yet so many Christian people always think and expect if there's a war or a calamity
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.140]   that you're certain to get a great revival. Many thought it at the end of this last great
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:56.360]   world war. Now then, they said, this will bring people to their senses. The book of
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:02.760]   Revelation tells you that it won't. And it never has done. Revivals have never come
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:10.720]   in that way. How materialistic we become and how unspiritual in our thinking. People always
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.080]   seem to think that if there's a terrible earthquake or some horrible disaster, that
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.600]   people are to be so affected that there'll be large numbers who'll turn to Christ.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:28.120]   They become still more infuriated. No, no, men and women are not converted by calamities.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:35.640]   It takes the Holy Spirit to save a soul. So don't expect anything from wars and calamities
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:41.200]   and pestilences. They seem to harden men and women. They seem to infuriate them as they
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:46.960]   did here. The rest of men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:53.280]   of their hands, that they should not worship devils and so on. In fact, they were still
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:25:00.920]   more incensed. You see, history has been verifying this prophecy. It's been happening throughout
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:06.360]   the centuries. It isn't something that's going to happen in the future. These things
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:13.240]   have already been taking place in different forms at different epochs and eras in the
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.800]   history of the world. Well, now then, that brings us to the end of chapter 9. But what
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:24.600]   about chapters 10 and 11, ask someone? Well, there again, you see, we are given the picture
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:31.680]   of the Church. In 8 and 9, we are given this picture of what happens to these godless people
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.080]   who persecute the Church. What of the Church in the meantime? Well, we are told in chapters
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:44.760]   10 and 11. And there is a very interesting statement in chapter 10, you remember it?
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:51.080]   The book that was given to him to eat, and it was sweet in his mouth but became bitter
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:59.200]   in his belly. That again is a picture which you find in the Old Testament, you remember.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:06.560]   What does it mean? It means this. There is nothing so sweet in this world as the gospel
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:14.160]   of redeeming grace. And when you first see it and appreciate it and know it what it is,
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:21.280]   it brings to you a sweetness which nothing else in this world can do. But my dear friend,
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:28.120]   as certainly and as surely as you become a Christian, and because you've become a Christian,
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:35.720]   because you've eaten that word and masticated it and swallowed it, you'll get trouble.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:40.800]   It will lead to suffering. It will lead to persecution. I've already told you about
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:46.400]   that in the seals. I've reminded you of what Paul tells Timothy, that "Yea, all that
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:54.540]   live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." Don't make a mistake about it. Don't listen
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:58.600]   to people who tell you, "You come to Christ and all will be well with you and you'll
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:04.880]   never have another trouble in the whole of your life." It's a lie. It isn't true.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:12.080]   The sweetness is always followed by a bitterness. Christ came not to bring peace in their sins
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:21.880]   but a sword. And as you're enjoying the sweetness of this glorious gospel of redemption,
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.640]   you will find that it may lead to bitterness between you and someone who has always been
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:33.040]   very loving to you until you became a Christian, but who now turns against you. You see how
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:38.920]   true it is? It always happens, doesn't it? Every Christian in this congregation knows
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:44.520]   that this is the simple truth. The sweetness becomes bitterness in that sense. Not that
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:50.400]   the sweetness is gone, but it's followed by a kind of bitterness. It always happens.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:56.520]   And how glorious it is that we should be told this and prepared for it, so that we mustn't
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:02.640]   be upset and almost lose our faith when we find that because we have become Christian
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.160]   that other people turn against us, who used to be so vandalous. You must rather expect
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:13.120]   it. It's a proof of your calling. It's because you are changed and they are not.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:18.600]   And therefore they are bitter towards you. Very well then, there is that there in chapter
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:27.240]   11. But in chapter 11 it's given us in a still more specific manner. I'm not going
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:32.720]   into all the details. I'm giving you the broad principles as I'm saying. In chapter
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:38.920]   11 all this is put before us in the form of two witnesses. And the two witnesses, you
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:45.920]   remember, go on preaching, but then they begin to be persecuted with terrible severity. Who
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:52.920]   are the two witnesses? Many, many answers have been given to that question and I can't
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.480]   prove to you that what I'm going to suggest to you is the right one. You can't prove
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.600]   these things. Nobody can prove them. But I suggest to you that there you've got your
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:06.840]   Old Testament and your New Testament. The law and the gospel that always go together.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.760]   Two witnesses always, remember, Christ sent them out two by two. It is in the mouth of
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:17.440]   two witnesses and here are the two witnesses. The law, the gospel, and the one needs the
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:22.840]   other. The law prepares for the gospel and the gospel reflects its radiance upon the
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:27.720]   law. You can't really understand one as it were without the other. They always go together,
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:35.720]   the two witnesses. Yes, and they are persecuted in a most terrible and terrifying manner.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:43.320]   Indeed, at the end we are told that they are actually killed. And the world at this point
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:52.080]   is full of rejoicing and of exultation. Listen to this. I'm reading in chapter 11, verse
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:57.000]   8, "And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:05.600]   is called Sodom and Egypt." You notice it's all symbols. "Where also our Lord was crucified,
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:10.600]   and they of the people," listen to this, "and they of the people and the kindreds and tongues
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:16.520]   and nations shall see their dead bodies three and a half days, and shall not suffer their
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:22.400]   dead bodies to be put in the graves. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:29.840]   them and make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.320]   them that dwelt on the earth." What does that mean? Well, surely we know something about
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:42.000]   that. Whenever the attack of the world and the flesh and the devil is powerful against
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.520]   the gospel, the world always rejoices. It thinks this is marvelous. It makes fun of
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:57.400]   the Lord God himself and of Christ and of the church and of Christian people. It's been
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:06.280]   doing so in this present century. Infidelity has been arrogant and boastful. It's been
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:14.640]   indulging in a lot of braggadocio. All this has been ridiculous. Yes, but my friends,
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.680]   it's going to get even worse than that. Do you remember something that our blessed Lord
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:27.360]   himself once said? He said, "When the Son of Man is come, shall he find faith on the
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:36.200]   earth?" There is a day coming, you see, prophesied by him and prophesied here, when it will almost
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   look as if the Christian witness and testimony will finally have been destroyed. And the
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:49.680]   world will be congratulating itself for its advance and its development, how it's outgrown
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:55.440]   this folklore, this childishness. God will have been put one side, Christ and his cross
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.300]   will have been forgotten, and they'll send presents to one another. They're so marvelous.
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:05.200]   The world will be such a glorious place. Man will be so amazing. That's what they're going
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:14.640]   to do. So let us not be surprised if even we live to see something like that. It isn't
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.240]   quite as bad as that yet. We've known it up to a measure. We know something of this
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:25.800]   ribald laughter of the world, this utter ridiculing of us because we are Christians and still
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.520]   believe the Old Testament and the New. But it will get worse and worse before the end,
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:38.240]   so that all men will say it's finished. But it won't be finished, because after three
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.760]   and a half days the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.760]   feet, and great fear fell upon all that saw them. And they heard a great voice from heaven
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:56.280]   saying unto them, "Come up here." And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud, and their
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:01.840]   enemies beheld them. And go on reading when you get home to the end of the chapter, and
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:08.120]   you'll see the woes that will come upon this world that in its blasphemy thought it had
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:15.960]   defeated God and had ended His Christ and the glorious testimony of salvation. That's
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:24.280]   the prophecy. In other words, chapter 11, verses 15 to 19 take you right on again to
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:32.320]   the final judgment. The end of the world once more. We came there at the end of the series
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:40.520]   of seals, and in exactly the same way we come to that same end here at this end of the trumpet
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:46.640]   series. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead that
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:51.160]   they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants, the prophets
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:56.600]   and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great, and shouldest destroy
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:02.200]   them which destroy the earth. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and so on. And
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:08.760]   the ark of the testament were revealed. It's the final judgment.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:14.800]   Now that's the trumpet series. You see, in a sense we've been covering the same period
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:23.060]   of history exactly as we covered in the seals. But this time our eye has not been so much
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:30.160]   upon God's people as upon those who persecute God's people. The warnings, the threatenings,
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:34.920]   the judgments, but still they won't repent, and on and on it goes, leading to a great
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.840]   climax at the end. And then when they think they're triumphant, sudden destruction cometh
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:49.120]   upon them as a thief in the night. Very well, there is the trumpet series. But still we
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:58.920]   are only at the end of our first major section, so that we are far from being at the end of
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:09.200]   the book. The second section, as I've already reminded you more than once, goes on to deal
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:20.640]   with the same things again, but shows us all this at a very much deeper level.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:26.920]   There at the beginning of chapter 12, you remember, you go back again to the incarnation.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:32.560]   The man-child that is born of this woman, the woman Israel, he was born of the seed
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:38.400]   of David according to the flesh. He is the son of David, he is the son of Abraham. That's
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:45.560]   the woman that brings him forth. Do you remember how at once an attempt is made to destroy
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:54.080]   him? And eventually he was crucified, but he was taken up to heaven. And then we are
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:36:04.640]   given this picture of these tremendous and mighty forces that are arrayed against him,
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:11.840]   and especially as he is represented by his people, his seed, this other seed of the woman,
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:17.480]   you remember, that is there in that wilderness, this great spout of water that's sent after
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:22.640]   to try to destroy them, but it doesn't succeed. I need to give you something to consider until
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:32.440]   we meet again. In this section, the chapters 12 to 14, a description of the great antagonists
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:40.320]   of the Lord Jesus Christ and his church. The first is the dragon, which is none other than
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:47.680]   the devil himself. Read chapter 12 for an account of him. He was driven out of heaven
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:54.360]   and came down upon the earth, and there he begins to attack. We'll go into this again
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:37:00.560]   in greater detail. But then you go on into chapter 13, and you remember a beast was seen
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:07.840]   rising up out of the sea, and you're given a description of him. And he corresponds,
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:14.240]   doesn't he, to that fourth beast in the seventh chapter of Daniel? But he's a composite
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:19.080]   picture. He isn't only the fourth beast. He's like that fourth beast, but he's got
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:24.800]   certain characteristics also of the other previous three beasts in the seventh of Daniel.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:30.720]   What is he then? Well, undoubtedly, this is the great secular power of the world that
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:39.120]   is opposed to Christ and his people. Worldly governments, worldly authorities and powers,
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:45.640]   kings and princes and dynasties and empires and governments throughout the centuries that
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:51.120]   have persecuted God's people. It started with the Roman Empire, and it has continued
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:57.760]   in a measure ever since, and is happening today. The earthly powers that persecute
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:04.520]   the church, the secular powers. And then you remember that second beast that came and arose
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:12.680]   out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it didn't speak like a lamb, you
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:19.740]   remember? This curious mixture of lamb-like qualities and certain other qualities which
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:27.600]   are very contradictory of that. He had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:34.160]   What is this? Well, this is undoubtedly false religion. It looks as if it were a lamb, but
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:42.800]   it speaks like a dragon. False religions have ever persecuted the church of Christ. The
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:48.720]   devil has used them. It is he that gives power unto the beast, the first beast, and the first
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:59.880]   beast gives power to the second beast. False religion! And oh, the havoc they have wrought.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:07.160]   The false Judaism at the very beginning persecuted Christianity terribly. The emperor worship
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:14.280]   in the next centuries, in the Roman Empire, Mohammedanism, all these other religions,
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:19.280]   how they have hated the Christ and his people, and have persecuted them, and the devil has
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:28.520]   used them, all kinds of false religions. Represented sometimes by the papacy, it doesn't matter
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:34.680]   what they are. Any false religion, they are all represented and symbolized in this beast
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:39.320]   that came up out of the earth, and the image that he was able to make, and the miracles
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:44.600]   that he appears to be able to perform, as these religions always have claimed, and still
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:50.480]   claim, that they work miracles and can do marvels, and so they entice people.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:40:00.360]   Three of the great antagonists, but there are more. The great hall at Babylon. What
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:11.280]   is this? Well, this is undoubtedly, surely, the seductive power of the world and sin.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:17.680]   Everything in the world that tends to attract us, and to entice us, and to draw us from
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:28.680]   God and from the Lord Jesus Christ, pictured as a harlot, enticing and attracting, seducing.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:35.040]   We all know something about the way the world would seduce us and draw us from the simplicity
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:40.760]   and the purity that is in Christ. Not always in its rags, let us remember. Anything in
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:47.120]   the world that draws you away and entices you is equally bad. It may be fine culture,
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:52.480]   it may be noble idealism, but if it takes you from Christ, it's a manifestation of
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:58.680]   the seducing, attractive power of the great harlot.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:06.880]   And lastly, all the people who have the mark of the beast in their right hand and in their
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:14.400]   foreheads. Now then, we leave it at that for this evening. But there are the opponents
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:22.280]   of the church, headed up in the dragon, the devil, and the devil uses secular power, false
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:31.520]   religion, the seductive power of the sin of the world and the way of the world. And men
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:37.640]   and women who belong to that realm, who have got the mark of the beast in their foreheads
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:42.280]   and on their hands, and it controls commerce. If you want to get on, you've got to have
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.600]   the mark. It won't look at you if you haven't got it, and so on.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:52.040]   Well now then, there is the description of it. And God willing, next time when we meet
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:59.800]   on April the 22nd, we shall go on to consider how they operate and what happens to them.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:05.800]   And finally, we shall come on to the glorious victory of the Lord Jesus Christ over every
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:13.960]   one of them, and how they are all ultimately cast into the lake of perdition. And the Christ
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:24.200]   and his bride become one and enjoy one another in the eternal glory, forever and forever.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.520]   Amen.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.480]   Let us pray.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:35.400]   Our heavenly Father, we would again thank thee for thy goodness and thy kindness to
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:45.560]   us. O God, we thank thee that thou hast troubled to give us this knowledge. We thank thee
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:52.440]   for its comfort and its consolation. We thank thee for the way in which it proves to us
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:43:00.520]   that this word is thy word, and that it can never be broken. We thank thee that it establishes
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:08.960]   us in the faith, and establishes our faith in thy word and in its infallibility. O God,
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:15.720]   we pray thee, open our eyes more and more to this truth, that we may live by it and
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:22.080]   rest upon it and enjoy it, and go forward in its comfort whatever may chance to meet
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:30.720]   us. O God, we lift up our hearts together in humble praise and thanksgiving, and especially
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:39.560]   for him who, in order that we might enjoy these things, not only came from heaven to
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:48.480]   earth, but even went to the cross with its shame, and bore the agony and the punishment
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:44:00.520]   of our sins, that we might become thine. Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift. We thank
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:08.360]   thee that thou dost enable us to triumph and to prevail and to overcome by the blood of
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:17.480]   the Lamb and by the word of our testimony. And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:23.760]   and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:30.280]   continue with us now this night, throughout the remainder of this hour's short uncertain
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:44.320]   life and earthly pilgrimage, and until the final victory and crowning day. Amen.
