[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.960]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.080]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.700]   Today, we're going to talk all about hearing and balance
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.200]   and how you can use your ability to hear specific things
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.000]   and your balance system in order to learn anything faster.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.520]   The auditory system, meaning the hearing system,
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.680]   and your balance system,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.520]   which is called the vestibular system,
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.000]   interact with all the other systems of the brain and body
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.240]   and used properly can allow you
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.020]   to learn information more quickly,
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.040]   remember that information longer and with more ease,
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.800]   and you can also improve the way you can hear.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.440]   You can improve your balance.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.840]   We're going to talk about tools for all of that.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.260]   This is one area of science where we understand a lot
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.240]   about the cells and the mechanisms in the ear
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.840]   and in the brain and so forth,
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.480]   so we're going to talk about that a little bit,
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.660]   and then we're going to get directly into protocols,
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.800]   meaning tools.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.380]   We're also going to talk about ways
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.920]   in which the auditory and balance systems suffer.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.120]   We're going to talk about tinnitus,
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.920]   which is this ringing of the ears that,
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.420]   unfortunately for people that suffer from it,
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.840]   they really suffer.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.540]   It's very intrusive for them.
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.400]   We're going to talk about some treatments that can work
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.720]   in some circumstances and some of the more recent
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.140]   emerging treatments that I think many people
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.640]   aren't aware of.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.180]   We're also going to talk about this,
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.840]   what seems like kind of a weird fact,
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.800]   which is that 70% of people, all people,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.980]   make what are called autoacoustic emissions.
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.520]   Their ears actually make noises.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.780]   Chances are your ears are making noises right now,
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.440]   but you can't perceive them,
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.560]   and yet those can have an influence on other people
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.800]   and animals in your environment.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.240]   It's a fascinating aspect to your biology.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.080]   You're going to learn a lot about how your biology
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.940]   and brain and ears and the so-called inner ear
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.080]   that's associated with balance,
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.480]   you're going to learn a lot about how all those work.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.420]   You're going to learn a lot of neuroscience.
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.000]   I'll even tell you what type of music to listen to,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.960]   and if you listen to me,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.660]   you can leverage that in order to learn faster.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.580]   Before we begin talking about the science
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.380]   of hearing and balance and tools that leverage hearing
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.360]   and balance for learning faster,
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.340]   I want to provide some information about another way
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.880]   to learn much faster.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.800]   There's a paper that was published recently.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.620]   This is a paper that was published in Cell Reports,
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.400]   an excellent journal.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.500]   It's a peer-reviewed paper from a really excellent group
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.900]   looking at skill learning.
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.840]   Now, previously, I've talked about how
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.300]   in the attempt to learn skills,
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.300]   the vital thing to do is to get lots of repetitions.
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.540]   You've heard of the 10,000 hours thing.
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.180]   You've heard of lots of different strategies
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.980]   for learning faster, 80/20 rule and all that.
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.960]   The bottom line is you need to generate
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.500]   many, many repetitions of something
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.660]   that you're trying to learn,
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.500]   and the errors that you generate
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.340]   are also very important for learning.
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.020]   It also turns out that taking rest
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.520]   within the learning episode is very important.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.380]   I want to be really clear what I'm referring to here.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.860]   In earlier episodes, I've discussed how
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.180]   when you're trying to learn something, it's beneficial,
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.660]   it's been shown in scientific studies,
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.100]   that if you take a 20-minute shallow nap
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.820]   or you simply do nothing after a period of learning,
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.880]   that it enhances the rates of learning
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.060]   and the depth of learning,
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.820]   your ability to learn and remember that information.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.120]   What I'm about to describe are new data
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.620]   that say that you actually should be injecting rest
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.540]   within the learning episode.
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.900]   Now, I'm not talking about going to sleep while learning.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.340]   This is the way that the study was done.
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.940]   The study involved having people learn sequences of numbers
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.300]   or keys on a piano.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.180]   So let's use the keys on a piano example.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.500]   I'm not a musician, but I think I'll get this correct.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.220]   They asked people to practice a sequence of keys,
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.000]   G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.260]   and they would practice that either continually
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.020]   for a given amount of time,
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.300]   or they would just do that for 10 seconds.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.820]   They would play G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G,
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.420]   G-D-F-E-G for 10 seconds,
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.780]   and then they would take a 10-second pause, a rest.
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.460]   They would just take a space or a period of time
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.080]   where they do nothing for 10 seconds.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.420]   Then they would go back to G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G.
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.840]   So the two conditions essentially
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.740]   were to have people practice continually,
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.300]   lots of repetitions,
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.300]   or to inject or insert these periods of 10 seconds idle time
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.520]   where they're not doing anything,
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.860]   they're not looking at their phone,
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.060]   they're not focusing on anything,
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.020]   they're just letting their mind drift
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.620]   wherever it wants to go,
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.260]   and they are not touching the keys on the keyboard.
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.460]   What they found was that the rates of learning,
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.300]   the skill acquisition and the retention of the skills
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.980]   was significantly faster
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.400]   when they injected these short periods of rest,
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.260]   these 10-second rest periods.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.380]   And the rates of learning were,
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.780]   when I say significantly faster, were much, much faster.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.120]   I'll reveal what that was in just a moment.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.460]   But you might ask, why would this work?
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.020]   Why would it be that injecting these 10-second rest periods
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.740]   would enhance rates of learning?
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.300]   What they called them was micro-offline gains
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.180]   because they're sort of taking their brain offline
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.420]   from the learning task for a moment.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.060]   Well, it turns out the brain isn't going offline at all.
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.460]   You've probably heard of the hippocampus,
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.520]   the area of the brain involved in memory,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.220]   and the neocortex, the area of the brain
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.340]   that's involved in processing sensory information.
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.500]   Well, it turns out that during these brief periods of rest,
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.600]   these 10-second rest periods,
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.940]   the hippocampus and the cortex are active in ways
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.780]   such that you get a 20-times repeat of the GDFEG.
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.200]   It's a temporal compression, as they say.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.460]   So basically, the rehearsal continues while you rest,
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.700]   but at 20 times the speed.
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.620]   So if you were normally getting just, let's just say,
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.620]   five repetitions of GDFEG, GDFEG, GDFEG per 10 seconds,
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.080]   now you multiply that times 20.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.720]   In the rest periods, you've practiced it 100 times.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.100]   Your brain has practiced it.
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.100]   We know this because they were doing brain imaging,
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.780]   functional imaging of these people with brain scanners
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.360]   while they were doing this.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.920]   This is an absolutely staggering effect.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.140]   And it's one that, believe it or not,
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.480]   has been hypothesized or thought to exist
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.580]   for a very long time.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.920]   This effect is called the spacing effect,
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.920]   and it was actually first proposed by Ebington in 1885.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.820]   And since then, it's been demonstrated
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.340]   for a huge number of different what they call domains,
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.160]   in the cognitive domain, so for learning languages,
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.240]   in the physical domain, so for learning skills
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.520]   that involve a motor sequence.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.720]   It's been demonstrated for a huge number
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.660]   of different categories of learning.
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.040]   If you want to learn all about the spacing effect
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.480]   and the categories of learning that it can impact,
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.360]   there's a wonderful review article.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.160]   I'll provide a link to it.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.420]   The title of the review article is
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.160]   Parallels Between Spacing Effects
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.100]   During Behavioral and Cellular Learning.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.040]   What that review really does is it ties
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.680]   the behavioral learning and the improvement of skill
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.540]   to the underlying changes in neurons
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.480]   that can explain that learning.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.960]   I should mention that the paper that I'm referring to,
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.040]   the more recent paper that injects these 10-second
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.160]   little micro offline gains rest periods,
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.360]   is the work of the laboratory of Leonard Cohen,
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.280]   not the musician Leonard Cohen.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.320]   He passed away, he was not a neuroscientist,
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.760]   a wonderful poet and musician, but not a neuroscientist.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.420]   Again, the paper was published in Cell Reports,
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.320]   and we will provide a link to the full paper as well.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.200]   So the takeaway is if you're trying to learn something,
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.640]   you need to get those reps in,
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.960]   but one way that you can get 20 times the number of reps in
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.040]   is by injecting these little 10-second periods
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.080]   of doing nothing.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.580]   Again, during those rest periods,
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.880]   you really don't want to attend to anything else
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.800]   as much as possible.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.280]   You could close your eyes if you want,
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.600]   or you can just simply wait
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.720]   and then get right back into generating repetitions.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.400]   I find these papers that Cell Reports
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.960]   and other journals have been publishing recently
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.320]   to be fascinating because they're really helping us
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.400]   understand what are the best protocols
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.080]   for learning anything,
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.760]   and they really leverage the fact
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.400]   that the brain is willing to generate repetitions for us,
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.680]   provided that we give it the rest that it needs.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.760]   So inject rest throughout the learning period,
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.680]   and if you can, based on the scientific data,
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.840]   you would also want to take a 20-minute nap
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.820]   or a 20-minute decompressed period
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.080]   where you're not doing anything after a period of learning.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.960]   I think those could both synergize
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.160]   in order to enhance learning even further,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.000]   although that hasn't been looked at yet.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.540]   Before we begin talking about hearing and balance,
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.740]   I just want to mention that this podcast is separate
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.240]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.500]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.360]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.540]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.040]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.080]   I want to thank the sponsors of today's podcast
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.400]   and make it clear that we only work with sponsors
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.320]   whose products we absolutely love
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.780]   and that we think you will benefit from as well.
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.840]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.900]   Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that, in my opinion,
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.660]   are the very highest quality available.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.900]   The company was founded by two All-American swimmers
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.860]   from Stanford, and everything about their eyeglasses
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.420]   and sunglasses were created with performance in mind.
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.080]   These eyeglasses and sunglasses have a number of features
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.200]   that really make them unique.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.080]   First of all, they're extremely lightweight.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.560]   The optical clarity of the lenses is spectacular.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.260]   And for the sunglasses, they have this really great feature,
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.640]   which is as you move in and out of shadows
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.320]   or as across the day, the amount of sunshine might change,
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.360]   you always experience the world as clear and bright.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.840]   And that can only come from really understanding
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.580]   how the visual system works.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.480]   The visual system has all these mechanisms
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.640]   for adaptation and habituation.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.220]   You don't need to know how those things work,
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.180]   but the folks at Roca clearly do
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.940]   because you put these glasses on
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.020]   and you don't even notice that they're on.
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.380]   They also stay on your face even if you get sweaty.
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.740]   They were designed to be used while active,
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.280]   so running and biking, et cetera, or indoors.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.520]   One thing that I really like about Roca eyeglasses
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.340]   and sunglasses is that the aesthetic is terrific.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.540]   Even though they were designed for performance,
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.980]   unlike a lot of sunglasses out there
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.300]   that were designed for performance
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.920]   that look kind of ridiculous, kind of space age,
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.060]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses, you could wear anywhere.
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.180]   And the aesthetic is really clean
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.860]   and they have a huge number of different styles
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.220]   to select from.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.920]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses,
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.260]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.260]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.420]   That's Roca, R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.620]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.960]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.380]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.120]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.720]   to help you better understand your body
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.620]   and reach your health goals.
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.740]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.660]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.180]   that impact our immediate and long-term health
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.960]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.220]   And now with the advent of DNA tests,
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.980]   we can get further insight and information
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.760]   into how our metabolism is working,
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.580]   how our brain is functioning, how our endocrine system,
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.900]   meaning our hormone system is functioning.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.180]   One of the issues with a lot of companies and programs
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.680]   that involve getting blood and DNA tests, however,
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.020]   is that you get the information back,
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.620]   you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.160]   With Inside Tracker, they make all of that very easy.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.000]   First of all, they can send someone to your home
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.320]   to take the samples if you like,
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.960]   or you can go to a local clinic.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.480]   You get the information back,
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.280]   and of course you get all the numbers and levels
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.460]   of hormone factors, metabolic factors, et cetera,
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.800]   but the dashboard in Inside Tracker provides directives
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.560]   so that if you want to bring those numbers up
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.840]   or bring them down,
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.500]   or if you want to keep them in the same range,
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.440]   it points to specific regimens related to nutrition,
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.440]   exercise, and other lifestyle factors.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.180]   So you can really move around those numbers
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.460]   to best suit your health goals and health status.
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.960]   If you want to try Inside Tracker,
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.980]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.020]   and you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.260]   Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.140]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.540]   Headspace is a meditation app
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.220]   that's backed by 25 published studies.
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.580]   And in addition to those,
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.900]   there are hundreds of studies showing
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.340]   that meditation is beneficial for our brain and for our body.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.740]   One of the challenges, however, is maintaining
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.260]   a meditation practice.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.960]   I started meditating a long time ago,
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.040]   but I found it very hard to keep that practice going.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.300]   Then I discovered the Headspace meditation app,
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.900]   and what I found was that because they have meditations
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.080]   that are very short, as well as some that are longer
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.020]   and some that are much longer,
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.620]   I could maintain my meditation practice.
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.620]   Sometimes I do a short five-minute meditation.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.700]   Sometimes I do 20-minute meditation.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.740]   I try and meditate at least 20 minutes per day,
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.540]   but sometimes, some weeks, I only do it five times a week,
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.140]   and I'll just meditate for longer.
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.100]   So with Headspace, you have the full palette
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.120]   of meditations to select from.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.400]   If you want to try Headspace,
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.600]   you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.360]   And if you do that, you'll get a free one-month trial,
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.220]   so no cost whatsoever,
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.940]   with their full library of meditations.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.020]   That's the best offer that they have.
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.200]   So again, if you want to try Headspace
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.260]   and you want to get access to all their meditations for free,
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.840]   go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.680]   Can you hear me?
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.980]   Can you hear me?
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.380]   Okay, well, if you can hear me, that's amazing,
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.980]   because what it means is that my voice
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.940]   is causing little tiny changes in the airwaves
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.700]   wherever you happen to be,
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.480]   and that your ears and whatever's contained in those ears
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.700]   and in your brain can take those sound waves
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.860]   and make sense of them.
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.500]   And that is an absolutely fantastic
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.140]   and staggering feat of biology,
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.700]   and yet we understand a lot about how that process works.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.140]   So I'm going to teach it to you now in simple terms
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.100]   over the next few minutes.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.880]   So what we call ears have a technical name.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.660]   That technical name is oracles,
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.180]   but more often they're called pinna, the pinna, P-I-N-N-A,
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.360]   pinna.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.980]   And the pinna of your ears,
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.880]   this outer part that is made of cartilage and stuff,
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.120]   is a range such that it can capture sound
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.340]   in the best way for your head size.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.980]   We're going to talk about ear size also,
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.160]   'cause it turns out that your ears change size
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.020]   across the lifespan and that how big your ears are,
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.120]   or rather how fast your ears are changing size
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.140]   is a pretty good indication of how fast you're aging.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.460]   So we'll get to that in a few minutes,
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.820]   but I want to talk about these things that we call ears
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.940]   and some of the stuff contained within them
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.640]   that allow us to hear.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.540]   So the shape of these ears that we have
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.320]   is such that it amplifies high-frequency sounds,
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.120]   high-frequency sounds as the name suggests
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.020]   are the squeakier stuff, right?
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.780]   So low-frequency sound.
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.080]   Costello snoring in the background,
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.760]   that's a low-frequency sound or high-frequency sound, okay?
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.200]   So we have low-frequency sounds and high-frequency sounds
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.860]   and everything in between.
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.860]   Now those sound waves get captured by our ears
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.700]   and those sound waves,
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.060]   for those of you that don't
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.580]   maybe fully conceptualize sound waves,
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.960]   are literally just fluctuations or shifts
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:56.580]   in the way that air is moving toward your ear
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.420]   and through space.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.940]   In the same way that water can have waves,
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.820]   air can have waves, okay?
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.060]   So it's reverberation of air.
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.260]   Those come in through your ears
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.800]   and you have what's called your eardrum.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.280]   And on the inside of your eardrum,
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.880]   there's a little bony thing
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.440]   that's shaped like a little hammer.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.520]   So attached to that eardrum,
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.680]   which can move back and forth like a drum,
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.480]   it's like a little membrane,
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.400]   you've got this hammer attached to it.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.320]   And that hammer has three parts.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.300]   For those of you that want to know,
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.980]   those three parts are called malleus, incus, and stapes.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.880]   It's like, but basically you can just think about it
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.720]   as a hammer.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.280]   So you've got this eardrum and then a hammer.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.040]   And then that hammer has to hammer on something.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.000]   And what it does is it hammers
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.280]   on a little coiled piece of tissue
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.720]   that we call the cochlea,
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.040]   sometimes called the cochlea,
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.020]   depending on where somebody lives in the country.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.900]   So typically in the Midwest, on the East Coast,
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.960]   they call them cochlea.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.720]   And on the West Coast, we call them cochlea.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.280]   Same thing, okay?
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.220]   So this snail-shaped structure in your inner ear
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:05.020]   is where sound gets converted into electrical signals
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.880]   that the brain can understand.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.540]   But I want to just bring your attention
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.000]   to that little hammer
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.200]   because that little hammer is really, really cool.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.400]   What it means is that sound waves come in through your ears.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.280]   That's what's happening right now.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.880]   That eardrum that you have is like a,
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.080]   it's like the top of a drum.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.980]   It's like a membrane, or it can move back and forth.
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.380]   It's not super rigid.
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.800]   And it moves that little hammer.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.960]   And then the hammer goes,
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.100]   doon, doon, doon, doon, doon,
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.060]   and hits this coil-shaped thing
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:34.000]   that we're calling the cochlea, okay?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Now, the cochlea at one end is more rigid than the other.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.440]   So one part can move really easily,
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.300]   and the other part doesn't move very easily.
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.660]   And that turns out to be very important for decoding
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.900]   or separating sounds that are low frequency,
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.680]   like Costello's snoring,
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.280]   and sounds that are of high frequency,
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.000]   like a shriek or a shrill.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.840]   And that's because within that little coiled thing
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.460]   we call the cochlea,
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.740]   you have all these tiny little, what are called hair cells.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.120]   Now, they look like hairs,
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.560]   but they're not at all related to the hairs on your head
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.180]   or elsewhere on your body.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.360]   They're just shaped like hairs.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.740]   We call them hair cells.
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.080]   Those hair cells, if they move,
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.980]   send signals into the brain
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.740]   that a particular sound is in our environment.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.620]   And if those hair cells don't move,
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.320]   it means that particular sound is not in our environment.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.160]   Okay?
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.600]   So just to give you the mental picture of this,
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.860]   sound waves are coming in
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.980]   because there's stuff out there making noises,
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.920]   like my voice.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.980]   It's changing the patterns of air around you
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.940]   in very, very subtle ways.
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.940]   That information is getting funneled into your ears
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.620]   because your pinna's are shaped in a particular way.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.140]   The eardrum then moves this little hammer
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.740]   and the hammer bangs on this little snail-shaped thing.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.980]   And because that snail-shaped thing at one end
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.780]   is very rigid, it doesn't want to move.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.140]   And at the other end, it's very flexible.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:09.660]   It can separate out high-frequency and low-frequency sounds.
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.260]   And the fact that this thing in your inner ear
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.440]   that we call the cochlea is coiled
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.560]   is actually really important to understand
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.660]   because along its length,
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.260]   it varies in how rigid or flexible it is.
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.020]   I already mentioned that before.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.000]   And at the base, it's very rigid.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.420]   And that's where the hair cells, if they move,
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.880]   will make high-frequency sounds.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.940]   And at the top, what's called the apex,
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.980]   it's very flexible and it's more like a bass drum.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.420]   So basically what happens is sound waves come into your ears
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.680]   and then at one end of this thing that we call the cochlea,
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.480]   at the top, it's essentially encoding
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.920]   or only responding to sounds that are like
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.060]   doom, doom, doom, doom.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.760]   Whereas at the bottom,
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.040]   it responds to high-frequency sounds
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.740]   like a cymbal, tss, tss, tss, tss, tss, tss, tss.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.060]   Okay, and everywhere in between,
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.640]   we have other frequencies, medium frequencies.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.660]   Now, this should stagger your mind.
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.720]   If it doesn't already, it should.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.400]   Because what this means is that
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.100]   everything that's happening around us,
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.460]   whether or not it's music or voices or crying or screaming
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.700]   or screaming of delight from small children
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.160]   who are excited 'cause they're playing
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.020]   or 'cause they get cake,
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.340]   all of that is being broken down into its component parts.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.960]   And then your brain is making sense of what it means.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.940]   These things that I've been talking about,
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.700]   like the pinna of your ears and this little hammer
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.740]   and the cochlea, that's all purely mechanical.
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.440]   It has no mind of its own.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.060]   It's just breaking things down into high frequencies,
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.060]   medium frequencies, and low frequencies.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.840]   And if you don't understand sound frequency,
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.060]   it's really simple to understand.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.180]   Just imagine ripples on a pond.
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.780]   And if those ripples are very close together,
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.960]   that's high frequency.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.940]   They occur at high frequency.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.380]   If those ripples are further apart, it's low frequency.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.380]   And obviously, medium frequency is in between.
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.820]   So just like you can have waves in water,
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.140]   you can have waves in air.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.300]   So that's really how it works.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.660]   Now, we are all familiar with light
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.240]   and how if you take a prism and put it in front of light,
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.980]   it will split that light into its different wavelengths,
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.260]   its different colors, red, green, blue, et cetera, right?
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.780]   So like the Pink Floyd, "Dark Side of the Moon" album,
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.820]   I think has a prism and it's converting white light
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.900]   into all the colors,
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.580]   all the wavelengths that are contained in white light.
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.740]   Your cochlea essentially acts as a prism.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.980]   It takes all the sound in your environment
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:46.740]   and it splits up those sounds into different frequencies.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.920]   So you can think of the cochlea of your ear
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.340]   sort of like a prism.
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.620]   And then the brain takes that information
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.100]   and puts it back together and makes sense of it.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.160]   So those hair cells in each of your two cochlea,
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.340]   'cause you have two ears, you also have two cochlea,
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.860]   send little wires, what we call axons,
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:09.580]   that convey their patterns of activity into the brain.
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.180]   And there are a number of different stations
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.780]   within the brain that information arrives at
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.100]   before it gets up to the parts of your brain
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.100]   where you are consciously aware.
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.220]   And because some of you have asked for more names
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.600]   and nomenclature, I'll give that to you.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.140]   If you don't want a lot of detailed names,
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.740]   you can just ignore what I'm about to say.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.940]   But basically the cochlea send information
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.300]   to what's called the spiral ganglion.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.260]   The spiral ganglion, a ganglion, by the way,
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.820]   if you're going to learn any neuroscience,
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.980]   just know that anytime you hear ganglion,
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.100]   a ganglion is just a clump.
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.580]   So it means a bunch of neurons, so a clump of cells.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.140]   So the spiral ganglion is a bunch of neurons
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.540]   that the information then goes off to
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.740]   what are called the cochlear nuclei in the brainstem.
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.980]   Brainstem is kind of down near your neck.
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.860]   Then up to a structure that has a really cool name
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.220]   called the superior olive,
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.780]   because you have one on each side of your brain.
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.900]   And if I were to bring you to my lab
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.340]   and show you the superior olives in your brain
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.180]   or anyone else's brain, they look like little olives.
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.400]   They even have a little divot in them
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.620]   that to me looks like a pimento,
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.300]   but they just call them the superior olive.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.540]   And then the neurons in the superior olive,
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.940]   then they send information up
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.660]   to what's called the inferior colliculus,
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.820]   only called inferior because it sits below
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.700]   a structure called the superior colliculus.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.540]   And then the information goes up
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.340]   to what's called the medial geniculate nucleus,
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.880]   and then up to your neocortex
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.460]   where you make sense of it all.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.900]   Now, you don't have to remember all that,
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.620]   but you should know that there are a lot of stations
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.100]   in which auditory information is processed
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.460]   before it gets up to our conscious detection.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.880]   And there is a good reason for that,
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.660]   which is that more important than knowing what you're hearing
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.900]   you need to know where it's coming from.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:57.700]   It's vital to our survival that if something, for instance,
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.080]   is falling toward us,
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.120]   that we know if it's coming to our right side,
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.220]   if it's going to hit us from behind,
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.260]   we have to know, for instance,
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.620]   if a car is coming at us from our left or from our right,
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.460]   and our visual system can help with that,
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.020]   but our auditory and our visual system collaborate
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:17.820]   to help us find and locate the position of things in space.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.500]   That should come as no surprise.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.380]   If you hear somebody talking off to your right,
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.780]   you tend to turn to your right, not to your left.
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.220]   If you see somebody's mouth moving in front of you,
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.440]   you tend to assume that the sound
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.220]   is going to come from right in front of you.
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:37.220]   Disruptions in this auditory hearing and visual matching
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.660]   are actually the basis of what's called
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.260]   the ventriloquism effect,
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.100]   which we'll talk about in a few minutes in more depth.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.940]   But the ventriloquism effect
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.360]   can basically be described in simple terms
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.460]   as when you essentially think that a sound
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.100]   is coming from a location
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.300]   that it's not actually coming from.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.420]   We'll talk about that in a moment,
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.060]   but what I'd like you to realize
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.020]   is that one of these stations deep in your brainstem
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.320]   is responsible for helping you identify
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.480]   where sounds are coming from
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.880]   through a process that's called interaural time differences.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.980]   And that sounds fancy,
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.980]   but really the way you know where things are coming from,
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.280]   what direction a car or a bus or a person is coming from
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.060]   is because the sound lands in one ear before the other.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.660]   And you have stations in your brain,
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.180]   meaning you have neurons in your brain
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.860]   that calculate the difference in time of arrival
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.340]   for those sound waves in your right versus your left ear.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.240]   And if they arrive at the same time,
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.980]   you assume that thing is making noise right in front of you.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.220]   If it's off to your right,
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.740]   you assume it's over on your right.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.980]   And if the sound arrives first to your left ear,
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.820]   you assume quite correctly
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.940]   that the thing is coming toward your left ear.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.740]   So it's a very simple and kind of a mechanical system
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.900]   at the level of sound localization.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.260]   But what about up and down?
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.240]   If you think about it,
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.860]   a sound coming from above is going to land on your right ear
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.660]   and your left ear at the same time.
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.740]   A sound from below is going to land on your right ear
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.520]   and your left ear at the same time.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.700]   So the way that we know where things are
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.220]   in terms of what's called elevation,
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.700]   where they are in the up and down plane
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.300]   is by the frequencies.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:25.460]   The shape of your ears actually modifies the sound
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.780]   depending on whether or not it's coming straight at you
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.740]   from the floor or from high above.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.340]   And so already at the level of your ears,
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.140]   you are taking information about the outside world
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:40.740]   and determining where that information is coming from.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.100]   Now, this all happens very, very fast in a subconscious,
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.220]   but now you know why.
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.680]   If people really want to hear something,
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.620]   they make a cup around their ear.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.280]   They essentially make their ear
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.720]   into more of a fennec fox type ear.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.360]   If you've ever seen those cute little fennec fox things,
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.800]   they have these big spiky ears.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.440]   They kind of look like a French bulldog,
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.400]   although they're kind of the fox version
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.440]   of the French bulldog.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.080]   These big, tall ears,
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.200]   and they have excellent sound localization.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.200]   And so when people lean in with their hand like this,
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.040]   if you're listening to this,
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.220]   I'm just cupping my hand at my ear,
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.840]   I'm giving myself a bigger pinna.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.280]   Oh yeah, and if I do it on the left side, I can do this side.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.760]   And if I really want to hear something,
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.640]   I do it on both sides, okay?
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.320]   So this isn't just gesturing.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.400]   This actually serves a mechanical role.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.980]   And actually, if you want to hear
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.360]   where things are coming from
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.700]   with a much greater degree of accuracy,
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.240]   this can actually help
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.940]   because you're capturing sound waves
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.160]   and funneling them better.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.600]   It's really remarkable, this whole system.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.660]   So you've got these two ears,
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.820]   and because of the differences in the timing
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.560]   of when things arrive in those two ears,
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.520]   as well as these differences in the frequencies
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.880]   that certain things sound,
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.060]   or I should say the differences in the frequencies
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.280]   that arrive at your ears,
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.920]   depending on whether or not the thing is above you
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.600]   or right in front of you or below you,
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.440]   you're able to make out
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.320]   where things are in space pretty well.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.120]   So now you're probably starting to realize
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.600]   that these two things on the side of our head
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.720]   that we call ears are there for a lot more
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.840]   than hanging earrings on or for other aesthetic purposes
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.620]   or for putting sunglasses on top of.
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.260]   They are very powerful devices
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.140]   for allowing us to capture sound waves from our environment.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.620]   Now I have a question for you,
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.960]   which is, can you move your ears?
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.520]   Turns out that unlike other animals,
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.900]   humans are not terrifically good at moving their ears.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.240]   Other animals can move their ears even independently.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.880]   So Costello is pretty good at raising his ears,
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.760]   the two of them together.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.280]   He can't really move his ears separately.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.480]   Some dogs can do that really well.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.740]   In fact, sighthounds and some scent hounds
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.480]   do that exquisitely well.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.440]   Some animals like deer and other animals
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.080]   that really have a very acute hearing
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.960]   will put one ear down to a very particular angle
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.180]   and will tilt the other one
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.520]   and they will actually capture information
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:15.040]   about two distant sound-making organisms.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.940]   Those could be hunters coming after them
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.600]   or other animals coming after them.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.220]   They are very good at doing this.
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.440]   We're not so good at it,
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.960]   but about 60% of people it's thought
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.520]   can move their ears consciously
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.240]   without having to touch their ears.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.680]   So can you do that?
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.520]   Maybe you should try it.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.920]   Ask someone to look at you
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.440]   and see whether or not you can do it.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.680]   The typical distances that people can move it
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.300]   is usually no more than two or three millimeters.
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.940]   It's subtle, but can you flap your pinna
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.720]   with just using mental control?
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.460]   If you can, or if you can't,
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.180]   try looking all the way to your right
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.560]   or all the way to your left.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.920]   Obviously, if you're driving a car
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.480]   or doing something or exercising,
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.780]   don't put yourself in danger right now,
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.380]   but if you move your eyes all the way to your left,
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.020]   which I'm doing now, or all the way to my right,
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.000]   you might feel a little bit of a contraction of the muscles.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.800]   It's that control ear movement, all right?
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.780]   Now I want to ask you this.
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.560]   Can you raise one eyebrow?
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.640]   I'm not very good at it.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.580]   I can do a little bit,
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.040]   but it's mostly by like cramping down my face on one side,
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.280]   and I certainly can't raise my right eyebrow.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.620]   I can only do my left eyebrow.
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.460]   I'm trying to talk while I'm doing this,
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.040]   so this is why it looks strange.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.120]   People who can raise one eyebrow very easily
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.840]   almost always can move their ears
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.480]   without having to touch them.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.520]   It's controlled by the same motor pathway,
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.440]   and there does seem to be a small
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.200]   but statistically significant sex difference
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.180]   in the ability to move one's ears.
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.480]   Typically, men can do this more than women can,
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.080]   although plenty of women can move their ears as well.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.960]   Now, if you think that is all a little strange
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.540]   or off topic, it's not,
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.400]   because what we're really talking about here
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.480]   is a system of the brain, but also of the body,
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.400]   of the musculature for localizing things in space,
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.220]   and so you might find it interesting to note
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.640]   that one of the things that we share very closely
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.960]   with other primates, with non-human primates,
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.480]   like macaque monkeys and chimpanzees,
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.520]   if you look at their ears,
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.780]   their ears are remarkably similar to our ears,
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.840]   or rather our ears are remarkably similar to their ears.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.620]   The eyes of certain monkeys, like macaque monkeys,
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.920]   are remarkably similar to human eyes.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   This is one of the reasons
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.080]   why if you look at a baby macaque monkey,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.300]   it has this unbelievably human element to it,
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.020]   but the ears of these primates is very similar to our ears,
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.620]   our ears similar to their ears.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.180]   If you're interested in ear movements
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.440]   and what they could mean,
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.240]   and some of the things that ear movements correlate with
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.540]   in other aspects of our biology,
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.700]   there's a nice paper, actually, a scientific paper.
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.940]   The author's last name is Code, C-O-D-E.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.600]   It was published in 1995.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.020]   I'll give a reference to that.
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.480]   It's a review article that discusses
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.920]   some of the sex differences in ear movement control,
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.980]   as well as the relationship
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.160]   between ear movements and eye movements,
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.840]   and it's a pretty accessible paper.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.380]   It's one that I think any of you
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.020]   who are interested in this topic could parse fairly easily,
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.860]   and there's some very interesting underlying biology
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.200]   and some theories as to why humans
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.320]   would have this so-called vestigial
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.920]   or ancient carryover of a system for moving our ears.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:43.000]   Now, if ear movement seems strange,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.780]   next I want to talk about a different feature
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:49.900]   of your hearing and ears that's even stranger,
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.220]   but that has some really interesting implications
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.620]   for your biology,
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:59.120]   and I'm guessing that you've not heard of this.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.820]   What I'm about to describe are called
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.160]   autoacoustic emissions,
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.180]   and autoacoustic emissions, as the name suggests,
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.880]   are sounds that your ears make.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.220]   Believe it or not,
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:18.220]   70% of people make noises with their ears,
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.380]   but they don't actually detect them.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.820]   Like I said, you've never heard of this.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.580]   Okay, that's not what I mean,
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:28.700]   but what I do mean is that 70% of people's ears
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.060]   are making noise that's cast out of the ear,
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.560]   and these autoacoustic emissions
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.380]   actually can be detected by microphones.
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.420]   Sometimes they can be detected by other people in the room
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.480]   if they have very good hearing.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.580]   Now, it turns out that women,
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.140]   or I should be technical here,
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.620]   females who report themselves as heterosexual
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.660]   have a higher frequency, not frequency of sound,
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.840]   but a higher frequency of autoacoustic emissions
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.420]   than do men who report themselves as heterosexual.
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:04.220]   Women who report themselves as homosexual or bisexual
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:09.540]   make fewer autoacoustic emissions than heterosexual women.
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:13.620]   These are data that come from Dennis McFadden's lab
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.700]   at the University of Texas, Austin.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.460]   He actually discovered these,
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.380]   what are called sexual dimorphisms
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.480]   and differences based on sexual orientation
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.540]   without looking for them.
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:27.180]   He was studying hearing, he's a auditory scientist,
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.060]   and people were coming into his laboratory
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.380]   and they were detecting these autoacoustic emissions,
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:35.060]   and they started to notice the group differences
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.260]   in autoacoustic emissions.
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.300]   So they started asking people about their sex
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.300]   and about their sexual orientation,
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:45.580]   and these differences fell out of the data, as we say.
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.440]   And it's interesting because autoacoustic emissions
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.900]   are not something that we associate with sex
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.360]   or sexual dimorphism,
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.860]   but what these data really underscore is,
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.740]   first of all, a lot of us are making noises with our ears,
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.420]   some of us more than others,
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:04.220]   and that exposure to certain combinations of hormones
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.100]   during development are very likely shaping
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.700]   the way that our hearing apparati,
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.540]   meaning the cochlea and the pinna and all sorts of things,
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.340]   how those develop and how those function
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.620]   throughout the lifespan.
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:19.160]   We did do an episode on hormones and sexual development,
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.940]   which gets much deeper into the other effects
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.380]   that hormones have on the developing brain and body.
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.660]   If you want to check out that episode,
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:29.820]   we will put a link to it in the captions.
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.920]   So now I want to shift to talking about
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.340]   ways to leverage your hearing system, your auditory system,
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.860]   so that you can learn anything,
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.900]   not just auditory information, but anything faster.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.920]   I get a lot of questions about so-called binaural beats.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.220]   Binaural beats, as their name suggests,
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:52.480]   involve playing one frequency of sound to one ear
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.180]   and a different frequency of sound to the other ear.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:59.200]   So it might be doon, doon, doon, doon to your right ear,
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.620]   and it might be doon, doon, doon, doon, doon, doon,
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.060]   to the left ear.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.820]   And the idea is that the brain
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.300]   will take those two frequencies of sound,
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.260]   and because the pathways that bring information
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.860]   from the ears into the brain eventually cross over,
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.940]   they actually share that information
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.640]   with both sides of the brain,
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.500]   that the brain will average that information
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.020]   and come up with a sort of intermediate frequency.
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.340]   And the rationale is that those intermediate frequencies
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:32.340]   place the brain into a state that is better for learning.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.660]   And when I say better for learning,
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.620]   I want to be precise about what I mean.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.400]   That could mean more focus for encoding
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.820]   or bringing the information in.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.720]   As you may have heard me say before,
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.240]   we have to be alert and focused in order to learn.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.440]   There is no passive learning
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.140]   unless we're little tiny infants.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:54.760]   So can binaural beats make us more focused?
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.760]   Can binaural beats allow us to relax more if we're anxious?
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.300]   I know some people, they go to the dentist
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.360]   and the dentist offers binaural beats
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.640]   as they drill into your teeth and give root canals
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.580]   and things of that sort,
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.820]   probably causing some anxiety
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.720]   just describing those things right now.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.440]   But those are available in several dentists,
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.840]   many dental practices.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.460]   Their binaural beats have been thought
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.500]   to increase creativity,
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.620]   or at least have been proposed to increase creativity.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.320]   So what are the scientific data say about binaural beats?
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.640]   There are a number of different apps out there
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.980]   that offer binaural beats.
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.500]   There are a number of different programs.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.420]   I think you can also even just find these on YouTube
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.380]   and on the internet, but typically it's an app
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.120]   and you'll program in a particular outcome that you want,
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.400]   more focused, more creative, fall asleep,
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.500]   less anxious, et cetera.
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.420]   So what are the scientific data say?
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.040]   So believe it or not, the science on binaural beats
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.500]   is actually quite extensive and very precise.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:53.500]   So sound waves are measured typically in hertz or kilohertz.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.780]   I know many of you aren't familiar
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.900]   with thinking about things in hertz or kilohertz,
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.700]   but again, just remember those waves on a pond,
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.780]   those ripples on a pond.
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.660]   If they're close together,
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.420]   then they are of high frequency.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.700]   And if they're far apart, then they are low frequency.
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.840]   So when you hear more hertz,
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.660]   what you're essentially hearing is higher frequency, right?
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.320]   And so if it's many more kilohertz,
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.540]   then it's much higher frequency
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.500]   than if it's fewer hertz or kilohertz.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.220]   And so you may have heard of these things as delta waves
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.680]   or theta waves or alpha waves or beta waves, et cetera.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.320]   Delta waves would be big slow waves, so low frequency.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.660]   And indeed there's quality evidence
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.060]   from peer-reviewed studies that are not sponsored
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.800]   by companies that make binaural beat apps
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.780]   that tell us that delta waves like one to four hertz,
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.300]   so very low frequency sounds, think Costello's snoring,
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:51.300]   can help in the transition to sleep and for staying asleep.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.020]   And that theta rhythms, which are more like four to eight hertz
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:39:00.020]   can bring the brain into a state of subtle sleep
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:04.340]   or meditation, so deeply relaxed, but not fully asleep.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.020]   And then you can sort of ascend the staircase of findings
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.980]   here, so to speak, and you'll find evidence
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.760]   that alpha waves, eight to 13 hertz,
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.300]   can increase alertness to a moderate level.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.340]   That's a great state for the brain to be in
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:20.620]   for recall of existing information, okay?
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.420]   And that beta waves, 15 to 20 hertz,
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:27.300]   are great for bringing the brain into focus states
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:31.660]   for sustained thought or for incorporating new information
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.100]   and especially gamma waves, the highest frequency,
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.680]   the most frequent ripples of sound, so to speak,
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.600]   32 to 100 hertz for learning and problem solving.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:45.920]   Now, all of this matches, or I should say maps onto
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.540]   what I've said before about learning really nicely,
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.860]   which is that you need to be in a highly alert state
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.840]   in order to bring new information in,
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.440]   in order to access a state of mind
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.600]   in which you can tell your brain,
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.860]   or the brain is telling itself, okay, I need to learn this.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.440]   This is why stress and unfortunate circumstances
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.440]   are so memorable is because our brain gets
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.080]   into a really high alert system.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.380]   Here, we're talking about the use of binaural beats
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.200]   in order to increase our level of alertness
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.140]   or our level of calmness.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.260]   Now, that's important to underscore
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.720]   because it's not that there's something
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.780]   fundamentally important about the binaural beats.
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.380]   They are yet another way of bringing the brain
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.480]   into states of deep relaxation through low-frequency sound
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.380]   or highly alert states for focused learning
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:33.460]   with more high-frequency sound.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.780]   So they are effective,
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.020]   and I'll review a little bit of the data in detail.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.860]   They're effective, but it's not
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.920]   that they're uniquely special for learning.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.900]   It's just that they can help some people
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.460]   bring their brain into the state
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.820]   that allows them to learn better.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:55.020]   So there are a lot of studies that allowed us to arrive,
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.740]   or I should say allowed the field to arrive
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:02.660]   on these parameters of slow, low-frequency waves
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:03.900]   are going to bring you into relaxed states,
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.840]   high-frequency waves into more alert states.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:11.620]   There's very good evidence for anxiety reduction
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.260]   from the use of binaural beats.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:18.300]   And what's interesting is the anxiety reduction
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.980]   seems to be most effective when the binaural beats
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.280]   are bringing the brain into delta,
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:30.240]   so those slow, big waves like sleep, theta, and alpha states.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.300]   And I'll link to a couple of these studies,
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:36.020]   although I will probably link more to the list
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.020]   that really segregates them out one by one
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.120]   so you can see them all next to one another.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.580]   There's good evidence that binaural beats
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.860]   can be used to treat pain, chronic pain.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:47.620]   There's three studies in peer-reviewed journals
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.560]   which I took a look at,
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.580]   and they seem to be of good quality,
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.280]   not sponsored research, as we say,
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.940]   not paid for by any specific company.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.140]   Binaural beats have been shown
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:00.740]   to modestly improve cognition, attention,
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.700]   working memory, and even creativity.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:07.420]   But the real boost from binaural beats appears to be
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.980]   for anxiety reduction and pain reduction.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.700]   Some people might find these beneficial
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:16.100]   for these oral surgeries, right?
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.800]   Believe it or not, there are people who would rather
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.680]   have the entire root canal or cavity drilled
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.420]   without Novocain, and that's because they sometimes
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.340]   have a syringe phobia or something of that sort,
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.120]   or they just don't like being numb from the Novocain,
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.100]   or maybe there's an underlying medical reason.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.340]   But I think most people don't enjoy
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.300]   getting their teeth drilled,
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.700]   even if they have Novocain in there or a root canal.
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.500]   And so it seems that binaural beats can be effective
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.620]   in that environment, and you don't have to go
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.980]   into that sort of extreme environment
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.260]   to benefit from binaural beats.
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:50.260]   Binaural beats are a either relatively inexpensive thing
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.720]   to access, most of the apps are pretty inexpensive.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.480]   I don't have a favorite binaural beats app
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.880]   to recommend to you.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.140]   I confess I did use binaural beats a few years ago.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:04.020]   I kind of shifted over to other what I call NSDR,
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.520]   non-sleep deep breath protocols in favor of those.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.580]   But many people like binaural beats
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.720]   and say that they benefit from them,
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.440]   especially while studying or learning.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.580]   I think part of the reason for that relates to the ability
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.380]   to channel our focus when we have some background noise.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.140]   And this is something I also get asked about a lot.
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:27.140]   Is it better to listen to music and have background noise
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.820]   when studying, or is it better to have complete silence?
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.380]   Well, there's actually a quite good literature
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.200]   on this as well, but not so much as it relates
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.900]   to binaural beats, but rather whether or not people
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:41.500]   are listening to music, so-called white noise,
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.580]   brown noise, believe it or not, there's white noise
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.080]   and there's brown noise, there's even pink noise,
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.700]   and how that impacts brain states that allow us
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.340]   to learn information better or not.
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.100]   So now I'd like to talk about white noise.
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.940]   And I want to be very clear that white noise has been shown
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:02.480]   to really enhance brain states for learning
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:06.460]   in certain individuals, in particular in adults.
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.460]   But white noise actually can have a detrimental effect
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.040]   on auditory learning and maybe even the development
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.900]   of the auditory system in very young children,
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.940]   in particular in infants.
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.880]   So first I'd like to talk about the beneficial effects
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.280]   of white noise on learning.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.460]   There are some really excellent studies on this.
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:29.340]   The first one that I'd like to just highlight is one
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:32.200]   that's entitled Low-Intensity White Noise Improves
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.980]   Performance in Auditory Working Memory Task, an FMRI study.
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:40.980]   This is a study that explored whether or not learning
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:45.100]   could be enhanced by playing white noise in the background.
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:48.860]   But the strength of the study is that they looked
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.620]   at some of the underlying neural circuitry
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:52.820]   and the activation of the neural circuitry in these people
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:54.380]   as they did the learning task.
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:58.220]   And what it essentially illustrates is that white noise,
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:01.980]   provided that white noise is of low enough intensity,
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.880]   meaning not super loud, right?
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.100]   Not imperceptible, so not so quiet that you can't hear it,
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.740]   but not super loud either.
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.740]   It actually could enhance learning to a significant degree.
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.540]   And this has been shown now for a huge number
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:18.280]   of different types of learning.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:21.940]   There's a terrific article as well,
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.540]   as in a somewhat obscure journal, at least obscure to me,
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.240]   which is the effects of noise exposure
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.260]   on cognitive performance and brain activity patterns.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:32.660]   That's a study involving 54 subjects.
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:36.400]   They basically were evaluated for mental workload
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.700]   and attention under different levels of noise exposure,
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.020]   background noise, and different,
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:43.480]   essentially loudness of noise.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.740]   And the reason I like this study is that they looked
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.940]   at different levels of noise and types of noise,
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.440]   and they varied a number of different things,
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.780]   as opposed to just doing a kind of two-condition,
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:55.260]   either white noise or no white noise type thing.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.620]   And what they found, again, is that provided
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.680]   the white noise is not extremely loud,
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.920]   it could really enhance brain function
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.500]   for sake of learning any number
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.420]   of different kinds of information.
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:10.420]   Now, that's all great, but it really doesn't get
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.900]   to the kind of deeper guts of mechanism.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.380]   And as a neuroscientist, what I really want to see is not
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.660]   just that something has an effect, that's always nice.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.320]   It's always nice to see in a nice peer-reviewed study
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.220]   without any kind of commercial biases that there's an effect.
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.260]   Okay, binaural beats can enhance learning,
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.460]   or listening to white noise not too loud
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:28.940]   can enhance learning.
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.580]   But you really want to understand mechanism,
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:34.780]   because once you understand mechanism,
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.300]   not only does it start to make sense,
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.660]   but you can also imagine ways
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.660]   in which you could develop better tools and protocols.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.500]   So I was very relieved to find, or I should say excited
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.180]   to find this study published
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:48.460]   in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience.
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.620]   This is a 2014 paper.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:54.700]   White noise improves learning by modulating activity
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.380]   in dopaminergic midbrain regions
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.620]   and the right superior temporal sulcus, okay?
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:00.500]   Now, I don't expect you to know
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.460]   what the right superior temporal sulcus is.
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.500]   I don't expect you to know
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.260]   what the dopamine midbrain region is,
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.260]   but if you're like me,
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.740]   you probably took highlighted notice
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.220]   of the word dopaminergic.
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.660]   Dopamine is a neuromodulator,
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.840]   meaning it's a chemical that's released in our brain
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.020]   and body, but mostly in our brain,
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:23.020]   that modulates, meaning controls the likelihood
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.780]   that certain brain areas will be active
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.480]   and other brain areas won't be active.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.740]   And dopamine is associated with motivation.
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.500]   Dopamine is associated with craving.
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.800]   Motivation is associated with all sorts of different things,
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.220]   including movement.
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:37.220]   But what this study so nicely shows
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:42.900]   is that white noise can really enhance the activity
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.720]   of neurons in what's called the substantia nigra VTA.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:50.220]   The substantia nigra VTA is a very rich source of dopamine,
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:53.620]   and that's because it's very chock-a-block full
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.500]   of dopamine neurons.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:58.140]   It's an area of the brain that is perhaps
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:01.260]   the richest source of dopamine neurons.
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.740]   And you actually can see this brain region
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:06.100]   under the microscope, if you take a slice of brain
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.200]   or you look at a brain without even staining it
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.460]   for any proteins or dopamine or anything,
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:13.980]   it's two very dark regions at the kind of bottom
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.500]   of the brain, and the reason it's called substantia nigra,
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.220]   nigra meaning dark, is because the dopamine neurons
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:25.740]   actually make something that makes those neurons dark.
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:28.300]   And so you've got these two regions down there
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.560]   that contain dopamine and can release dopamine
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.960]   and essentially activate other brain regions
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.680]   and activate our sense of motivation
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.700]   and activate our sense of desire
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.020]   to continue focusing and learning.
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.460]   But you can't just snap your fingers
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:42.500]   and make them release dopamine.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.940]   You actually have to trigger dopamine release from them.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:46.520]   Now, that trigger can be caused
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.080]   by being very excited about something
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.540]   or the fact that that thing gave you a lot of pleasure
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:55.160]   in the past, or you're highly motivated by fear or desire.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.600]   But what's so interesting to me is that it appears
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:02.020]   that white noise itself can raise
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.280]   the what we call the basal, the baseline levels of dopamine
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.440]   that are being released from this area,
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.280]   the substantia nigra.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.000]   So now we're starting to get a more full picture
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.660]   of how particular sounds in our environment
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:20.420]   can increase learning, and that's in part, I believe,
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:24.700]   through the release of dopamine from substantia nigra.
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:28.220]   So I'm not trying to shift you away from binaural beats,
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.820]   if that's your thing, but it does appear
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.860]   that turning on white noise at a low level, not too loud,
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:35.100]   you may say, "Well, how loud?"
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:36.140]   And I'll tell you in a moment,
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.360]   but not too loud can allow you to learn better
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.280]   because of the ways that it's modulating
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.660]   your brain chemistry.
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:47.040]   So how loud or how soft should that white noise be
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.020]   while you learn?
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:52.460]   Well, in these studies, it seemed that white noise
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.300]   that could be heard by the person,
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.820]   so it wasn't imperceptible to them,
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:58.740]   so it was loud enough that they could hear,
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:03.740]   but not so loud that they felt it was intrusive
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:05.740]   or irritating to them, okay?
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.640]   So that's going to differ from person to person
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.860]   because people have different levels of auditory sensitivity.
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:11.820]   It's going to depend on age,
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:13.800]   going to depend on a number of different factors.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.600]   So I can't tell you turn to level two
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.900]   on your volume controller.
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:18.740]   That's just not going to work.
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.080]   Also, I don't know how far you are
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.580]   from a given speaker in the room,
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.440]   or if you've got earphones in your head,
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.060]   or you've got speakers in the room,
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:27.760]   or if it's coming out of your computer.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.960]   I don't know those things.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.420]   So what you're going to have to do is adjust that white noise
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.860]   to a place where it's not interfering
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:35.080]   with your ability to focus,
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.800]   but rather it's enhancing your ability to focus.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:41.200]   I think a good rule of thumb is going to be
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.860]   to put it probably on the lower third
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:46.080]   of any kind of volume dial,
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.160]   as opposed to in the upper third
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.480]   where it would really be blasting.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:55.840]   And really blasting any noise, frankly, is not good,
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.200]   but that's especially not good,
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.440]   meaning it's especially bad, if you have headphones in.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.460]   I do want to mention something about headphones
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.000]   before I talk about white noise in the developmental context
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.640]   and why it can be dangerous there.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.460]   When you put headphones in your ears,
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:17.720]   it has this incredible effect of making the sounds
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.680]   like they come from inside your head,
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.640]   not from out in the room.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.720]   And now that might seem like kind of a duh,
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.880]   but that's actually really amazing, right?
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.720]   Your brain assumes that the sounds
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.120]   are coming from inside your head,
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.020]   as opposed from the environment that you're in
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.600]   the moment you put headphones in.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:34.940]   So if you're listening to an audio book,
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:37.240]   or maybe you're listening to this podcast with headphones,
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.100]   that's very different than when you're listening
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.640]   to something out in the room and there are other sounds,
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:42.600]   other sound waves,
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.200]   especially if you use these noise cancellation headphones.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.100]   So if you're going to use white noise
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:50.560]   to enhance studying or learning of any kind,
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.000]   or this also could be for skill learning,
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.620]   motor skill learning while you're exercising,
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:58.200]   my suggestion would be that if you're using headphones
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.280]   to keep it quite low, right?
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.380]   This is an effect on the midbrain dopamine neurons.
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:05.840]   That's a background effect of raising the baseline
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.680]   of dopamine release.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.880]   The way that dopamine neurons fires, they're always firing.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.680]   Yours are firing right now, so are mine.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.960]   When something exciting happens, they fire a lot.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.360]   And when something disappointing happens,
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.280]   that firing, the release of dopamine
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.960]   goes down below baseline.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.560]   What you're talking about here is raising
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.620]   your overall levels of attention and motivation,
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.440]   which translate to better learning,
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:26.280]   by just tickling those neurons a little bit,
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.100]   raising the baseline firing, okay?
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.280]   So you're not turning up the white noise
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.060]   to the point where you're feeling amazing.
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.060]   This isn't like turning on your favorite song.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.800]   This is actually the opposite.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.820]   This is about getting that baseline up just a bit, okay?
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:43.420]   So I recommend turning the volume up just a bit
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:46.720]   so that you can focus entirely on the tasks
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.560]   that you're trying to do.
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.240]   And of course, you've turned on white noise,
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.860]   so your attention might drift to that for a moment.
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.840]   Is it too loud? Is it too soft?
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:55.280]   If you can disappear into the work, so to speak,
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.140]   if your attention can disappear into the work,
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:00.280]   then that's probably sufficiently quiet.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.200]   And for those of you that say,
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.560]   "Well, I like really loud music,
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.400]   and if I just blast the music,
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.820]   then I forget about the music,"
[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:08.520]   I don't suggest blasting music.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:12.200]   And this is coming from somebody who really likes loud music.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.640]   I grew up with kind of a loud, fast rules mentality.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.400]   And if you don't know what loud, fast rules means,
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.740]   then I can't help you.
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:22.460]   But there's a time and a place, perhaps,
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.500]   to listen to music loud, but especially with headphones,
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:30.000]   you can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.180]   And unfortunately, because these hair cells
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:34.120]   that we talked about earlier,
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.120]   our central nervous system neurons, they do not regenerate.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.000]   They do not come back.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.940]   Now, along the lines of hearing loss,
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:45.200]   I should just say that the best way
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:49.000]   to blow out your hearing for good, to eliminate your hearing,
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.860]   is to have very loud sounds
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.860]   superimposed on a loud environment, okay?
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.380]   So loud environments can cause hearing loss over time.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:00.300]   So if you work at a construction site clanging really loud,
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:03.700]   or if you work the soundboard in a club or something,
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.740]   you are headed towards hearing loss
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:07.600]   unless you protect your hearing
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.980]   with earplugs and headphones.
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.780]   Nowadays, some of the earplugs are very low profile,
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:13.840]   meaning you can't see them.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.940]   So that's kind of nice, so you're not like the,
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:17.940]   like when I was younger, you didn't want to be the dork
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.360]   to go to the concert with the earplugs,
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.780]   but turns out those dorks were smarter than everybody else
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.700]   because they're not the ones who are craning their neck
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:26.420]   to try and hear trivial things
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:32.440]   at the age of 30 or so because they blew out their hearing.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:35.340]   So if you are working in a loud environment
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:38.660]   or you expose yourselves to a loud environment,
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.980]   you really want to avoid big inflections
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:43.360]   in sound above that.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:47.180]   So loud environment plus fireworks,
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.140]   loud environment plus gunshot,
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:53.580]   loud environments plus very high-frequency intense sound,
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.580]   that's what we call the two-hip model.
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:57.800]   When you, this is also true for concussion,
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.860]   that you can take a kind of a stimulus
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.020]   that normally would be below the threshold of injury,
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:05.140]   you add another stimulus at the same time
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:06.820]   that would be below the threshold of injury,
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:08.800]   and then suddenly you killed the neurons.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.580]   So I don't want to make people paranoid,
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:11.860]   but you do want to protect your hearing.
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:13.600]   It's no fun to lose your hearing.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.160]   If you're going to use headphones
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.040]   and you feel like you want to crank it up all the way,
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:20.740]   just remember that the more that you can get
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:22.060]   out of a lower volume,
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.820]   meaning the longer that you can go listening
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.640]   to things at lower volume,
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:30.120]   the longer you'll be able to hear that music or that thing.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:35.120]   So again, I'm not the hearing cop, that's not my job,
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.740]   but as somebody who's lost
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:38.660]   some of his high-frequency hearing,
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:40.860]   I can tell you it's not a pleasure.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:45.480]   The old argument that it helps you not have to hear
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.260]   or listen to people that you don't want to listen to,
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:48.340]   that it doesn't really work,
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:50.380]   they just send you text messages instead.
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.980]   So what about white noise and hearing loss in development?
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:55.340]   You know, a lot of people with children
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.580]   have these kind of noise machines,
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:59.240]   like sound waves and things like that,
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.980]   that help the kids sleep.
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:03.620]   And look, I think kids getting good sleep
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:05.500]   and parents getting good sleep is vital
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:08.940]   to physical and mental health and family health.
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:13.860]   So I certainly sympathize with those needs.
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:17.020]   However, there are data that indicate
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.780]   that white noise during development
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:22.400]   can be detrimental to the auditory system.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.700]   I don't want to frighten any parents,
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:25.460]   if you played white noise to your kids,
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:27.060]   this doesn't mean that their auditory system
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:29.740]   or their speech patterns are going to be disrupted
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.100]   or that their interpretation of speech
[00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:32.900]   is going to be disrupted forever,
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:37.140]   but there are data published in the journal Science,
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.580]   in Science being one of the three apex journals,
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:42.360]   Science, Nature, Cell, the most stringent journals,
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:46.180]   data published in the journal Science some years ago,
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.300]   actually by a scientist who I know quite well,
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.820]   his name is Edward Chang, he's a medical doctor now,
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:51.900]   he's a neurosurgeon,
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:55.100]   he's actually the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:58.840]   and he runs a laboratory where they study auditory learning,
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:00.440]   neuroplasticity, et cetera.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:04.740]   He and his mentor at the time, Mike Mursinek,
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:08.580]   published a paper showing that if young animals,
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:10.460]   and this wasn't animal models,
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:13.100]   were exposed to white noise,
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:17.140]   so shh, the very type of noise that I'm saying
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.760]   as a older person, and when I say older,
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.940]   I mean somebody who's in their late teens,
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:25.060]   early 20s and older, could benefit from listening to that
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:28.500]   at a low level in the background for sake of learning,
[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:32.040]   well, they exposed very young animals to this white noise,
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:36.600]   it actually disrupted the maps of the auditory world
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.680]   within the brain.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.240]   And we haven't talked about these maps yet,
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.640]   but I want to take a moment and talk about them
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:44.000]   and explain this effect and what it might mean for you
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.560]   if you have kids or if you were exposed
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.620]   to a lot of white noise early on.
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:52.280]   So auditory information goes up into our cortex,
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.740]   into essentially the outside portion of our brain
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:59.520]   that's responsible for all of our higher level cognition,
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.800]   our planning, our decision-making, et cetera,
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.680]   creativity, and up there,
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.920]   we have what are called tonotopic maps.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.400]   What's a tonotopic map?
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.720]   Well, remember the cochlea, how it's coiled,
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.680]   and at one end, it responds to high frequencies,
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.520]   and the other end, it responds to low frequencies?
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:17.720]   Sort of like a piano, the keys sound different
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.960]   as you extend down and up the piano keys,
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.680]   and it's organized in a very systematic way, right?
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:26.280]   It's not all intermixed high frequencies and low frequencies,
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:29.040]   it's organized in a very systematic way
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.700]   from one end to the other.
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:33.640]   Your visual system is in what's called a retinotopic map,
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.860]   so neighboring points in space off to my right,
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:38.900]   like my two fingers off to my right,
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:43.000]   are mapped to neighboring points in space in my brain,
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.420]   and the space right in front of me
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:47.160]   is mapped to a different location in my brain,
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.800]   but it's systematic, it's regular, it's not random,
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.440]   it's not salt and pepper, it goes from high to low
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.960]   or from right to center to left.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.080]   In the auditory system,
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.460]   we have what are called tonotopic maps,
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:02.320]   where frequency, high frequency to low frequency,
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.240]   and everything in between is organized
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.340]   in a very systematic way.
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:09.520]   Now, our experience of life from the time we're a baby
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.640]   until the time that we die is not systematic,
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:15.160]   we don't hear low frequencies at one part of the room
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:16.040]   or at one part of the day,
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.660]   and high frequencies at another part of the room
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:20.400]   and another part of the day, they're all intermixed,
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.480]   but if you remember, the cochlea separates them out
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.560]   just like a prism of light separates out
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:26.740]   the different wavelengths of light,
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:29.980]   the cochlea separates out the different frequencies,
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:33.880]   and the developing brain takes those separated out
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:37.000]   frequencies and learns this relationship
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.860]   between itself, meaning the child, and the outside world.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:48.440]   White noise essentially contains no tonotopic information,
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:52.840]   the frequencies are all intermixed, it's just noise,
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:55.400]   whereas when I speak, my voice has,
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.380]   now I'm getting technical, but it has what's called
[00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:00.100]   a certain envelope, meaning it has some low frequencies
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.440]   and some slightly high frequencies,
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.820]   I can make my voice higher, although I'm not very good
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:05.820]   at that, my voice starts to crack,
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:07.180]   and I can make my voice lower,
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.860]   although not as low as Costello's snore,
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.420]   so it has an envelope, it has a container,
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.020]   white noise has no container,
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:17.400]   it's like all the colors of the rainbow spread out together,
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.860]   which is actually what you get when you get white light,
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.400]   white noise is analogous to white light.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:28.400]   So one of the reasons why hearing a lot of white noise
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.600]   during development for long periods of time
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.360]   can be detrimental to the development of the auditory system
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.120]   is that these tonotopic maps don't form normally,
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.040]   at least they don't in experimental animals.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:43.400]   Now, the reason I'm raising this is that many people I know,
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.800]   in particular friends who have small children,
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:50.800]   they say, I want to use a white noise machine while I sleep,
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:56.160]   but is it okay for my baby to use a white noise machine?
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.740]   And I consulted with various people, scientists about this,
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.080]   and they said, well, you know,
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.360]   the baby is also hearing the parents' voices
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.500]   and is hearing music and is hearing the dog bark,
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.320]   so it's not the only thing they're hearing.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:12.780]   However, every single person that I consulted with said,
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.800]   but you know, there's neuroplasticity during sleep,
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.640]   that's when the kid is sleeping,
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.460]   and I don't know that you'd want to expose a child
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.560]   to white noise the entire night,
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.320]   because it might degrade that tonotopic map.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.880]   It might not destroy it, it might not eliminate it,
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.000]   but it could make it a little less clear,
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.960]   like sort of taking the keys on the piano
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.360]   and taping a few of them together, right?
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.720]   So you've still got the highs and lows
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.080]   in the appropriate order and everything in between,
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.720]   but when you tape the keys together,
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.320]   you don't get the same fidelity,
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.360]   you don't get the same precision
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.760]   of the noise that comes out of that piano.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.920]   So again, I don't want to scare anybody,
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.600]   but I would say if you are in a position
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.600]   to make the choice of either using white noise
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.600]   or something similar,
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.260]   pink noise is just a kind of variation,
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.260]   it's got a little bit more of a certain frequency,
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.200]   just like pink light has a little bit more
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.000]   of a certain wavelength than white light,
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   kind of if you are in a position to make choices
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.860]   about things to put in a young,
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:16.400]   especially very young child's sleeping environment,
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.680]   white noise might be something to consider avoiding,
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.200]   again, I'm not telling you what to do,
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.720]   but it's something to perhaps consider avoiding.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.380]   I don't think most pediatricians
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.300]   are going to be aware of these data,
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:30.200]   but if you talk to any auditory physiologists
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.940]   or an audiologist or somebody
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:34.280]   who studies auditory development,
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.200]   I'm fairly certain that they would have opinions about that.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.440]   Now, whether or not their opinions agree with mine
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.840]   and these folks that I consulted with or not
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.960]   is a separate matter, I don't know 'cause I don't know them,
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.280]   but it's something that I felt was important enough
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.440]   to cue you to, especially since I've highlighted,
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.060]   excuse me, the opposite effect is true in adulthood.
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:56.460]   Once your auditory system has formed,
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.640]   once it's established these tonotopic maps,
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.120]   then the presence of background white noise
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.720]   should not be a problem at all.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.240]   In fact, it shouldn't be a problem at all
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.300]   because you're also not attending to it.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.460]   The idea is that it's playing at a low enough volume
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.080]   that you kind of forget it in the background
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.960]   and that it's supporting learning by bringing your brain
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.200]   into a heightened state of alertness
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.640]   and especially this heightened state of dopamine,
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.800]   dopaminergic activation of the brain,
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.360]   which will make it easier to learn faster
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.680]   and easier to learn the information.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.340]   So now I want to talk about auditory learning
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.000]   and actually how you can get better
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.960]   at learning information that you hear,
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.860]   not just information that you see on a page
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.920]   or motor skill learning.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.560]   There are a lot of reasons to want to do this.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.000]   A lot of classroom teaching,
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.520]   whether or not it's by Zoom or in person
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.960]   is auditory in nature.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.080]   Not everything is necessarily written down for us.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:52.080]   It's also good to get better at listening or so I'm told.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.960]   So there's a phenomenon called the cocktail party effect.
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.040]   Now, even if you've never been to a cocktail party,
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.780]   you've experienced and participated
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.900]   in what's called the cocktail party effect.
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.780]   The cocktail party effect is where you are in an environment
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:08.200]   that's rich with sound, many sound waves
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.520]   coming from many different sources, many different things.
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:14.060]   So in a city, in a classroom, in a car
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.520]   that contains people having various conversations,
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:20.560]   you somehow need to be able to attend
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.880]   to specific components of those sound waves,
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.640]   meaning you need to hear certain people and not others.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.920]   The reason it's called the cocktail party effect
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.920]   is that you and meaning your brain are exquisitely good
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:37.640]   at creating a cone of auditory attention,
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.960]   a narrow band of attention with which you can extract
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.760]   the information you care about
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:46.100]   and wipe away or erase all the rest.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:50.360]   Now, this takes work, it takes attention.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.380]   One of the reasons why you might come home
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:55.960]   from a loud gathering, maybe a stadium, a sports event,
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.200]   or a cocktail party for that matter and feel just exhausted
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.720]   is because if you were listening to conversations there
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.400]   or trying to listen to those conversations
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.720]   while watching the game and people moving past you
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.520]   and hearing all this noise, clinking of glasses, et cetera,
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.360]   it takes attentional effort
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:17.360]   and the brain uses up a lot of energy just at rest,
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.940]   but it uses up even more energy
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.160]   when you are paying strong attention to something,
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.660]   literally caloric energy,
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.480]   burning up things like glucose, et cetera.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.640]   Even if you're ketogenic, it's burning up energy.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:32.660]   So the cocktail party effect has been studied extensively
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:33.840]   in the field of neuroscience.
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.580]   And we now know at a mechanistic level
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:40.740]   how one accomplishes this feat of attending to certain sounds
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:43.480]   despite the fact that we are being bombarded
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.380]   with all sorts of other sounds.
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:46.880]   So there are a couple of ways that we do this.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:51.880]   First of all, much as with our visual system,
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:56.980]   we can expand or contract our visual field of view.
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:59.560]   So we can go from panoramic vision,
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:03.320]   see the entire scene that we are in by dilating our gaze,
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.840]   talked a lot about this on this podcast and elsewhere.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.520]   We can, for instance, keep our head and eyes stationary
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.560]   or mostly stationary.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.560]   You don't have to be rigid about it.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.920]   And you can expand your field of view
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.200]   so you can see the walls and ceiling and floor,
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.360]   can see yourself in the environment.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.720]   That's panoramic view.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.880]   It's what you would accomplish without having to try at all
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.880]   if you went to a horizon, for instance.
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.520]   Or we can contract our field of view.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.720]   I can bring my focus to a particular location,
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.560]   what we call a vergence point, directly in front of me.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:31.480]   Now I'm pointing at the camera directly in front of me.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.320]   Okay, we can do that.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.220]   We can expand and contract our visual field of view.
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:37.200]   Well, we can expand and contract
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.840]   our auditory field of view, so to speak,
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.080]   or our auditory window.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.400]   You can try this next time you are in an environment
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.440]   that's rich with noise, meaning lots of different sounds.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:54.440]   You can just tune out all the noise to a background chatter.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.900]   You kind of just, you try not focus
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.280]   on any one particular sound
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.840]   and you get the background kind of chatter of noise.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.040]   And you'll find that it's actually very relaxing
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.840]   in comparison to trying to listen to somebody
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.560]   at a cocktail party and you're shouting back and forth.
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.560]   Now, if you're very, very interested in that person
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.940]   or getting to know them better, or what they're telling you,
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:15.440]   or some combination of those things,
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.420]   then you'll be very motivated to do it,
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:21.220]   but nonetheless it requires energy and effort and attention.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:23.280]   How do we do this?
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.120]   Well, it's actually quite simple,
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.600]   or at least it's simple in essence,
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:32.720]   although the underlying mechanisms are complex.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:35.900]   Here I have to credit the laboratory
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:39.560]   of a guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R,
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.160]   up at the University of Oregon,
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:45.220]   who essentially figured out that we are able
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:48.040]   to accomplish this extraction of particular sounds.
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:52.160]   We can really hear one person or a small number of people
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.840]   amidst a huge background of chatter
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:59.840]   because we pay attention to the onset of words,
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:03.000]   but also to the offset of words.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.040]   Now, the way to visualize this is if the background noise
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.920]   is just like a bunch of waves of noise,
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.320]   it's literally just sound waves coming every frequency,
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.720]   low frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.200]   If you're at a game, people are shouting,
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.080]   people are talking on their phone.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:20.280]   There's the crack of the ball if somebody actually manages
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:24.420]   to hit the ball, the announcer, et cetera.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:27.300]   But whatever we're paying attention to,
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.620]   we set up a cone of auditory attention,
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:32.280]   a kind of a tunnel of auditory attention
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.400]   where we are listening, although we don't realize it,
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.060]   we are listening for the onset and the offset of those words.
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.660]   Now, this is powerful for a couple of reasons.
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:46.660]   First of all, it's a call to arms, so to speak,
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:50.520]   to disengage your auditory system
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.420]   when you don't need to focus your attention
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.840]   on something particular.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.020]   So if you are somebody, you're coming home from work,
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:09:00.180]   you've had a very long day and you're trying to make out
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:03.420]   a particular conversation on background noise,
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:06.380]   you might consider just not having that conversation,
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:10.420]   just letting your auditory landscape be very broad,
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.880]   almost like panoramic vision.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:17.040]   If you're trying to learn how to extract sound information,
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:22.040]   it could be notes of music, it could be scales of music,
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:24.780]   it could be words spoken by somebody else.
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:27.500]   Maybe somebody is telling you what you need to say
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.260]   for a particular speech or the information
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:32.560]   that you need to learn for a particular topic
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.060]   and they're telling it to you.
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:37.740]   Deliberately paying attention both to the onset
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:41.320]   and to the offset of those words can be beneficial
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:44.860]   because it is exactly the way that the auditory system
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:47.220]   likes to bring in information.
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:50.460]   So one of the more common phenomenon
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:53.460]   that I think we all experience is you go to a party
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:55.780]   and/or you meet somebody new and you say,
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.360]   "Hi," I would say, "Hi, I'm Andrew,"
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.820]   and they'd say, "Hi, I'm Jeff," for instance.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:00.660]   Great, great to meet you.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.920]   And then a minute later, I can't remember the guy's name.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.660]   Now, is it because I don't care what his name is?
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:08.100]   No, somehow the presence
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:10.260]   of other auditory information interfered.
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.740]   It's not that my mind was necessarily someplace else,
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:17.500]   it's that the signal to noise, as we say, wasn't high enough.
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:22.460]   Somehow the way he said it or the way it landed on my ears,
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.660]   which is really all that matters, right,
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:26.440]   when it comes down to learning,
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.820]   is such that it just didn't achieve
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.620]   high enough signal to noise.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:33.940]   The noise was too high or the signal was too low
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.820]   or some combination of those.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.460]   So the next time you ask somebody's name,
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:40.060]   remember, listen to the onset of what they say
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:40.900]   and the offset.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.940]   So it would be paying attention to the j in Jeff
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:47.500]   and it would be paying attention to the th in F, in Jeff.
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.540]   Excuse me, all right?
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:53.140]   And chances are you'll be able to remember that name.
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:58.020]   Now, I don't know if people who are super learners of names
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.360]   do this naturally or not.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.020]   I don't have access to their brains.
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.180]   I don't think they're going to give me access
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:03.500]   to their brains either.
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:07.060]   But it's a very interesting way to take the natural biology
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:08.820]   of auditory attention and learning
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:11.700]   and apply it to scenarios where you're trying to remember
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.540]   either people's names or specific information.
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:17.580]   Now, I do acknowledge that trying to learn every word
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:21.560]   in a sentence by paying attention to its onset and offset
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.020]   could actually be kind of disruptive
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.780]   to the learning process.
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.340]   So this would be more for specific attention.
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:29.520]   Like you're asking directions in a city and somebody says,
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:32.220]   okay, you say you're lost and they say, okay,
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.540]   you're going to go two blocks down,
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:35.860]   you're going to turn left,
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.820]   and then you're going to see a landmark on your right
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:42.820]   and then you're going to go in the third door on your left.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:45.420]   That's a lot of information, at least for me, okay?
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:48.180]   So the way you would want to listen to that is
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.260]   you're going to go down the road.
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:51.240]   See, I already forgot.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.720]   You're going to go left and you're just going to program.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.220]   And instead of just hearing the word left,
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:59.900]   you're going to think the L at the front of left and the T.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:02.140]   You're going to left, okay?
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:05.060]   And then, so you're coding in specific words.
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:07.780]   And what this does is this kind of hijacks
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:09.980]   these naturally occurring attention mechanisms
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:12.500]   that the auditory system likes to use.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:15.460]   It's a little bit of data that for auditory encoding,
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.640]   this kind of thing can be beneficial.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.580]   There are a lot of data that attention
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:23.660]   for auditory coding is beneficial.
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.660]   There are a little bit of data showing
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:29.980]   that deliberately encoding auditory information this way,
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:32.740]   meaning trying to learn auditory information this way,
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:35.580]   can be beneficial or can accelerate learning.
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:39.000]   And some of these features of what I'm describing here
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.580]   map onto some of the work of Mike Merzenich and others
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:46.500]   that have been designed to try and overcome things
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:49.780]   like stutter and to treat various forms
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:52.180]   of auditory learning disorders.
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:56.620]   But more importantly, and perhaps more powerful,
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:59.020]   is the work of Mike Merzenich
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.260]   that was done with his then graduate student,
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:03.700]   Greg Recanzone, that showed that
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:06.700]   using the attentional system,
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:09.380]   we can actually learn much faster
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:12.660]   and we can actually activate neuroplasticity
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:15.980]   in the adult brain, something that's very challenging to do,
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:19.460]   and that the auditory system is one of the main ways
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:22.580]   in which we can access neuroplasticity more broadly.
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.120]   So I just want to take a couple of minutes
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.340]   and describe the work of Recanzone and Merzenich
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:30.500]   because it's absolutely fantastic and fascinating.
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.980]   What they did is they had subjects
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:36.940]   try to learn auditory information,
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:40.020]   except that they told them to pay attention
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:42.400]   to particular frequencies.
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.760]   So now you know what frequencies are,
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:47.420]   so essentially high-pitched sounds or low-pitched sounds.
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:52.300]   What they found was just passively listening
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:56.180]   to a bunch of stuff does not allow the brain to change
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.920]   and for that stuff to be remembered at all.
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.940]   That's not a surprise.
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:03.540]   We've all experienced the phenomenon of having someone talk
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:04.900]   and we see their mouth moving and we're like,
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:06.620]   yeah, this is really important, this is really important,
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:07.980]   we're listening, we're trying to listen,
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.260]   and then they walk away and we think,
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:11.340]   I didn't get any of that.
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:13.340]   And you wonder whether or not it was them.
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:15.020]   Maybe this is happening to you right now.
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:17.720]   You wonder whether or not it was you.
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.740]   You wonder whether or not you have trouble with learning
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.220]   or you have attention deficit.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:23.180]   It could be any number of different things,
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:25.260]   but what Recanzone and Merzenich discovered
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:28.480]   was that if you instruct subjects to listen
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.780]   for particular cues within speech or within sounds,
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:35.740]   that not only can you learn those things more quickly,
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:40.740]   but that you can remap these tonotopic maps in the cortex
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:43.140]   that I referred to earlier.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:45.420]   You actually get changes in the neural architecture,
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:46.980]   the neural circuitry in the brain,
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:50.640]   and this can occur not only very rapidly,
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.100]   but they can occur in the adult brain,
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.860]   which prior to their work
[01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:57.340]   was not thought to be amenable to change.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.420]   It was long thought that neuroplasticity
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:01.220]   could only occur in the developing brain,
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:03.180]   but the work of Recanzone and Merzenich
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:06.780]   in the auditory system actually was some of the first
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:10.700]   that really opened up everybody's eyes and ears
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:14.060]   to the idea that the brain can change in adulthood.
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:16.340]   So here's how this sort of process would work
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:18.340]   and how you might apply it.
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:20.540]   If you are trying to learn music
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:23.520]   or you're trying to learn information
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.180]   that you're going to then recite,
[01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:30.100]   you can decide to highlight certain words
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:33.620]   or certain frequencies of sound
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:36.380]   or certain scales or certain keys on the piano
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:40.220]   and to only focus on those for certain learning bouts.
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:44.320]   So I'll give an example that's sort of real time for me,
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.980]   meaning it's happening right now.
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:51.340]   I know generally what I want to say when I arrive here.
[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:53.280]   I even know specifically certain things
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.500]   that I want to make sure get across to you,
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:58.900]   but I don't think about every single word
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:01.460]   that I'm going to say and the precise order
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.300]   in which I'm going to say those things.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:05.200]   That would be actually very disruptive
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.500]   because it wouldn't match my normal patterns of speech
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:10.540]   and you'd probably think I was sounding rather robotic
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:11.840]   if I were to do that.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:15.780]   So one way that we can remember information is
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:19.140]   as we write out, for instance, something that we want to say,
[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:20.900]   we can highlight particular words.
[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:22.280]   We can underline those.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.660]   If we're listening to somebody
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:28.780]   and they are telling us information,
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:31.740]   we can decide just to highlight particular words
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:34.380]   that they said to us and write those down.
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.980]   Now, of course, we're listening to all the information,
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:38.900]   but the work of Reconzone and Merzenich
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:42.500]   and the work of others, in addition to them,
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:46.620]   his former student or former postdoc, I don't know which,
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:49.540]   Michael Kilgard, who's now got his own lab down in Texas,
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:52.440]   or others, have shown that the queuing of attention
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.700]   to particular features of speech,
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:57.020]   particular components of speech,
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:00.420]   the way in which it increases our level of attention overall
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:04.100]   allows us to capture more of the information overall.
[01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.980]   And so I don't want this to be abstract at all.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:07.880]   What this means is when you're listening,
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:10.380]   you don't have to listen to every word.
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:12.080]   You're already listening to every word.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.380]   All the information's coming in through your ears.
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:18.740]   What you're trying to extract is particular things
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.740]   or themes within the content.
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:22.580]   So maybe you decide, if you're listening to me,
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:26.180]   that you're only going to listen to the word tools
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:27.220]   or you're only going to listen
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:29.820]   to when my voice kind of goes above background.
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:32.700]   You get to decide what you decide to listen to or not.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.940]   And what you decide to focus on
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:37.360]   isn't necessarily as important
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.240]   as the fact that you're focusing.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.540]   So I hope that's clear.
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.780]   The auditory system does this all the time
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:44.020]   with the cocktail party effect.
[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:46.720]   What I'm talking about is exporting certain elements
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.360]   of the mechanisms of the cocktail party effect,
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.820]   paying attention to the onset and offset of words
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:55.500]   or particular notes within music or particular scales,
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.020]   or you can make it even broader
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:00.200]   and particular motifs of music
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.500]   or particular sentences of words or particular phrases.
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.480]   And in doing that,
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.280]   you extract more of the information overall,
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.500]   even though you're not paying attention
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.780]   to all the information at once.
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:13.420]   Now I'd like to talk about a phenomenon
[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:17.900]   that you've all experienced before, which is called Doppler.
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:22.900]   So the Doppler effect is the way that we experience sound
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.840]   when the thing that's making that sound is moving.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.540]   The simplest way to explain this
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:35.380]   is to translate the sound into the visual world once again.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:39.080]   So if you've ever seen a duck or a goose
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.820]   sitting in a pond or a lake,
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:44.420]   and it's kind of bobbing up and down,
[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:46.580]   what you'll notice is that the ripples of water
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:49.360]   that extend out from that duck or goose
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.060]   are fairly regularly spaced in all directions.
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:54.700]   And that's because that duck or goose is stationary.
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:55.540]   It's moving up and down,
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:58.960]   but it's not moving forward or backward or to the side.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:02.100]   Now, if that duck or goose were to swim forward
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:05.900]   by paddling its little webbed feet under the surface,
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:09.080]   you would immediately notice that the ripples of water
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:12.460]   that are close to and in front of that duck or goose
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:15.480]   would be closer together than the ones that trailed it,
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:16.780]   that were behind.
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:19.960]   And that is essentially what happens with sound as well.
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.300]   With the Doppler effect,
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.740]   we experience sounds that are closer to us
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:29.440]   at higher frequency, the ripples are closer together,
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.700]   and sounds that are further away at lower frequency,
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:35.000]   especially when they're moving past us.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.060]   So if you've ever, for instance,
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:39.360]   heard a siren in the distance,
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:41.360]   [hums]
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:50.400]   that's essentially my rendition of a siren.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.860]   I don't know what ambulance or police or what,
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:54.900]   passing you on a street.
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:57.260]   That is the Doppler effect.
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.920]   The Doppler effect is one of the main ways
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:04.920]   that we make out the direction that things are arriving from
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.020]   and their speeds and trajectories.
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:11.680]   And we get very good from a very young age
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:15.280]   at discerning what direction things are arriving from
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:19.300]   and the direction that they are going to pass us in.
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:21.240]   And the Doppler effect has probably saved your life
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:22.980]   many, many times.
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:24.520]   In this way, you just don't realize it
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.940]   because you'll step off the curb
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:29.260]   or you're driving your car and you pull to the side
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:32.120]   so that the ambulance or fire truck can go by
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:37.060]   because you heard that siren off in the distance.
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:38.500]   And then you pull away from the curb
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.960]   and you get back on the road,
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.840]   in part because you don't see it any longer,
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.940]   but also you don't hear any other sirens in the distance.
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:49.000]   Now, some animals such as bats are exquisitely good
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.920]   at navigating their environments according to sound.
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:55.320]   Now, we've all heard that bats don't see.
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.360]   That's actually not true.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.680]   They actually have vision,
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:00.280]   but they just rely more heavily on their auditory system.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:03.520]   And the way that bats navigate in the dark
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.280]   and the way that bats navigate using sound
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:07.880]   is through Doppler.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.120]   Now, they don't simply listen to whether or not
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:14.640]   things are coming at them or moving away from them
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.760]   and pay attention to Doppler
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:18.920]   like the siren example I gave for you
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:22.600]   what they do is they generate their own sounds.
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:27.600]   So a bat, as it flies around is sending out clicks.
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:30.400]   I think that's my best bat sound
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:33.180]   or maybe it's, and they're clicking.
[01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:35.080]   They're actually propelling sound out
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.320]   at a particular frequency that they know.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.180]   Now, whether or not they're conscious of it, I don't know.
[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:41.020]   I've never asked them.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:42.500]   And if I did ask them, I don't think they could answer.
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:43.340]   And if they could answer,
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:45.820]   they couldn't answer in a language that I could understand.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:48.120]   But the bat is essentially flying around,
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.760]   sending out sound waves,
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:52.040]   pinging its environment with sound waves
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.360]   of a particular frequency.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.800]   And then depending on the frequency of sound waves
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.200]   that come back,
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.940]   they know if they're getting closer to an object
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:01.120]   or further away from it.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.860]   So if they send out sounds at a frequency of,
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:06.660]   this was much slower than it would actually occur,
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:10.720]   but let's say one every half second [mumbles]
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.760]   and it's coming back even faster [mumbles]
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.720]   then they know they're getting closer, right?
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.000]   Because of the Doppler effect.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.240]   And if it comes back more slowly,
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.280]   they know that there's nothing in front of them.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:25.840]   So the bat is essentially navigating its world
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:29.380]   by creating these auras of sound
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:32.960]   that bounce back onto them from the various objects,
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.520]   trees, et cetera, buildings, and people.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.360]   It's kind of eerie to think about,
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.200]   but yes, they see you with the,
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.880]   experience you with their sound.
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:40.800]   They sense you.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.440]   And they're using Doppler to accomplish it.
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:48.000]   Now I'd like to talk about ringing in the ears.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   This is something that I get asked about a lot.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.360]   And speaking of signal to noise,
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.540]   I don't know if I get asked about it a lot
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:58.920]   because many people suffer from ringing in their ears
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.400]   or because the people who suffer
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.120]   from ringing in their ears suffer so much
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.460]   that they are more prone to ask.
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:08.280]   So it could be a sampling bias, I don't know,
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:10.400]   but I've been asked enough times
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.780]   and some of the experiences of discomfort
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:15.040]   that people have expressed about having
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:18.100]   this ringing of the ears really motivated me
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:20.640]   to go deep into this literature.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:24.120]   So the ringing of the ears that one experiences
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:29.120]   is called tinnitus, not tinnitus, but tinnitus.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:32.700]   And tinnitus can vary in intensity,
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:36.200]   and it can vary according to stress levels.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:40.520]   It can vary across the lifespan or even time of day.
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:43.360]   So it's very subject to kind of background effects
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.800]   and contextual effects.
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:48.820]   So I think we all know that we should do our best
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:50.160]   to maximize healthy sleep.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.960]   We did a number of episodes on that.
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.760]   Essentially the first four episodes
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.620]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast were all about sleep
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.020]   and how to get better sleep.
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:24:00.120]   We all know that we should try and limit our stress,
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:02.200]   and we had an episode about stress
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.400]   and ways to mitigate stress as well.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:08.440]   However, there are people, it seems,
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.840]   that are suffering from tinnitus
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.400]   for which stress or lack of sleep
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:15.000]   just can't explain the presence of the tinnitus.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.560]   Tinnitus can be caused by disruption to these hair cells
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.640]   that we talked about earlier or damage to the hair cells.
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.200]   So that's another reason why,
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.400]   even if you have good hearing now,
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:30.040]   that you want to protect that hearing
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.560]   and really avoid putting yourself
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.680]   into these kind of two-hit environments,
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.920]   environments where there's a lot of background noise,
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.960]   and then you add another really loud auditory stimulus.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.560]   This also can happen at different times, I should mention.
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.280]   If you go to a concert
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.000]   or you listen to loud music with your headphones,
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.620]   and then you go to a concert
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:52.120]   or you go into a very loud work environment,
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.920]   the hair cells can still be vulnerable.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.560]   And once those hair cells are knocked out,
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.780]   currently we don't have the technology to put them back,
[01:24:58.780 --> 01:24:59.920]   although many groups,
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:03.440]   including some excellent groups at Stanford and elsewhere too,
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.360]   of course, are working on ways
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.720]   to replenish those hair cells and restore hearing.
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:11.520]   There are treatments for tinnitus
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:16.400]   that involve taking certain substances.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.880]   There are medications for tinnitus.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:21.800]   In the non-prescription landscape,
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:24.280]   which is typically what we discuss on this podcast
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.020]   when we discuss taking anything,
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:29.620]   there are essentially four compounds
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:32.560]   for which there are quality peer-reviewed data
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:36.880]   where there does not appear to be any overt commercial bias,
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.040]   meaning that nothing's reported in the papers
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.120]   as funding from a particular company.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:46.120]   And those are melatonin, ginkgo bilboa, zinc, and magnesium.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:49.080]   Now, I've talked about melatonin before.
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:53.080]   I'm personally not a fan of melatonin as a sleep aid,
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.440]   but there are four studies.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:01.560]   First one entitled "The Effects of Melatonin on Tinnitus"
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.680]   and "Sleep."
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:05.780]   Second one, "Treatment of Sensual and Sensory Neural Tinnitus
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:07.640]   with Orally Administered Melatonin,"
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.600]   and then the title goes on much longer,
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.560]   but it's a randomized study.
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:12.600]   I'm not going to read out all of these.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.660]   "Melatonin, Can it Stop the Ringing?"
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:17.720]   which is an interesting article, double-blinded study,
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:20.060]   and "The Effects of Melatonin on Tinnitus."
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:23.840]   Each one of these studies has anywhere from 30
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:26.960]   to more than 100 subjects,
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:29.240]   in one case, 102 subjects, both genders,
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.960]   as they list them out.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.040]   Typically, it's listed as sex, not gender in studies,
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.400]   so it should say both sexes, but nonetheless.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:42.560]   An age range anywhere from 30 years old
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.400]   all the way up to 65 plus.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.780]   I didn't see any studies of people younger than 30.
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:51.980]   All three focused on melatonin,
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:54.600]   not surprisingly because of the titles.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.080]   Looking at a range of dosages,
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.600]   anywhere from three milligrams per day,
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:02.280]   which is sort of typical of many supplements for melatonin,
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:06.440]   still much higher than one would manufacture endogenously
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.320]   through your own pineal gland,
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.280]   but three milligrams in these studies
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.340]   for a duration of anywhere from 30 days
[01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:19.260]   to much longer, in some cases, six months.
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:22.680]   And all four of these studies found modest
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:26.040]   yet still statistically significant effects
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.200]   of taking melatonin by mouth,
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.460]   so it's orally administered melatonin,
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:36.280]   in reducing the severity of tinnitus.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.040]   So that's compelling, at least to me.
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:40.920]   It doesn't sound like a cure.
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:44.420]   And of course, as always, I'm not a physician.
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:46.480]   I'm a scientist, so I don't prescribe anything.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.480]   I only profess things.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.640]   I report to you the science.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:51.040]   You have to decide if melatonin is right for you,
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.100]   if you have tinnitus.
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:56.260]   And certainly, I say that both to protect myself
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:58.360]   but also protect you, you're responsible
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.000]   for your health and wellbeing.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.360]   And I'm not telling anyone to run out
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.240]   and start taking melatonin for tinnitus,
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.300]   but it does seem that it can have some effects
[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:09.480]   in reducing its symptoms.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.120]   Ginkgo boa boa is an interesting compound.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:17.160]   It's been prescribed for or recommended for many,
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:21.840]   many things, but there are a few studies,
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.920]   again, double-blinded studies lasting one to six months,
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.940]   any one that has an impressive number of subjects,
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:32.940]   978 subjects ranging from age 18 all the way up to 65,
[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:38.080]   so on and so forth, that show not huge effects of ginkgo,
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:43.220]   but as they quote, "Limited evidence suggests
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:47.160]   that if tinnitus is a side effect of something else,
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.440]   in particular cognitive decline,"
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:54.440]   so age-related tinnitus might be helped by ginkgo boa boa.
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:58.960]   I won't go through all the details of the zinc studies,
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:01.440]   but it seems that zinc supplementation at higher levels
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.280]   than are typical of most people's intake,
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.280]   so 50 milligrams per day,
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:07.460]   do appear to be able to reduce subjective symptoms
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:09.960]   of tinnitus in most of the people
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.720]   that took the supplemented zinc.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.860]   There aren't a lot of studies on that,
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:16.800]   so I could only find one double-blinded study.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.560]   It lasted anywhere from one to six months, 41 subjects,
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:23.400]   both genders listed out again here, 45 to 64,
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:27.280]   and they saw a decrease in the severity of tinnitus symptoms
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:31.280]   with 50 milligrams of elemental zinc supplementation.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:34.320]   And then last but not least is the magnesium study.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.360]   Again, only a single study.
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.720]   It's a phase two study looking
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:41.000]   at a fairly limited number of subjects,
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.920]   so only 19 subjects,
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:46.460]   taking 532 milligrams of elemental magnesium.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.720]   For those of you that take magnesium,
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.560]   there's magnesium and elemental magnesium,
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:52.280]   and it's always translated on the bottle,
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:54.760]   but it was associated with a lessening of symptoms
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:56.060]   related to tinnitus.
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:59.740]   So for you tinnitus sufferers out there,
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:01.200]   you may already be aware of this.
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.680]   You may already be taking these things
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:06.280]   and had no positive effects,
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:08.440]   meaning they didn't help, maybe not.
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:11.520]   I hope that you'll at least consider these,
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.120]   talk to your doctor about them.
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.240]   I do realize that tinnitus is extremely disruptive.
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.880]   I can't say I empathize
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:21.520]   because I don't from a place of experience, that is,
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.660]   because I don't have tinnitus,
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:24.640]   but for those of you that don't, including myself,
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:27.120]   you can imagine that hearing sounds
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.320]   of things that aren't there
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.400]   and the ringing in one's ears can be very disruptive
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:33.000]   and I think would be very disruptive
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.300]   and explains why people with tinnitus reach out so often
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.360]   with questions about how to alleviate that,
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.840]   and I hope this information was useful to you.
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:44.800]   I'd like to now talk about balance and our sense of balance,
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:48.040]   which is controlled by, believe it or not,
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:50.960]   our ears and things in our ears,
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:55.540]   as well as by our brain and elements of our spinal cord.
[01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:58.160]   But before I do that, I want to ask you another question,
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:00.720]   or I would rather, I'd like to ask you
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:03.360]   to ask yourself a question and answer it,
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:07.240]   which is how big are your ears?
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:10.520]   It turns out that the ears grow our entire life.
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:15.400]   In the early stage of our life, they grow more slowly,
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:19.120]   and then as we age, they grow more quickly.
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:22.120]   You may have noticed, if you have family members
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:25.000]   who are well into their 70s and 80s,
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.840]   and if you're fortunate, into their 90s
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.760]   and maybe even hundreds,
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:33.460]   is that the ears of some of these individuals
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:38.400]   get very, very big relative to their previous ear sizes.
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:41.440]   It turns out that biological age
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:46.180]   can actually be measured according to ear size.
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:47.500]   Now, you have to take a few measurements,
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:49.140]   but believe it or not,
[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:51.880]   there is a formula in the scientific literature.
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:56.560]   If you know your ear circumference,
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:01.320]   so the distance around your ear, ears, plural,
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:05.300]   presumably you have two, most people do, in millimeters,
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:07.460]   so you're going to take the circumference
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:10.140]   of your ears in millimeters, how would you do this?
[01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:11.040]   How would you do this?
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:14.360]   Maybe you take a string and you put it around your ear,
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.420]   and then you measure the string.
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:18.080]   That's probably going to be easier than marching around
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.400]   your ear or somebody else's ear with a ruler
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:21.560]   and measuring in millimeters.
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:23.520]   So what's your ear circumference?
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:26.380]   On the outside, don't go in on the divot or anything.
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:28.020]   You're just going around as if you were going to trace
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:32.320]   the closest fitting oval, assuming your ears are oval,
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:36.000]   closest fitting oval that matches your ear circumference.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.920]   Take that number in millimeters, subtract from it.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:43.240]   Oh, excuse me, I should do this correctly.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:46.060]   Do that for both ears, add them together,
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.840]   add those numbers together, divide by two,
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:50.120]   get the average for your two ears,
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:51.820]   get your average ear circumference
[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:53.520]   from across your two ears.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:58.180]   Then take that number in millimeters, subtract 88.1,
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:04.360]   and then whatever value that is, multiply it times 1.96,
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:07.360]   and that will tell you your biological age.
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:10.700]   Now, why in the world would this be accurate?
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:14.100]   Well, as we age, there are changes in a number
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.760]   of different biological pathways.
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:19.700]   One of those pathways is the pathways related
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:21.760]   to collagen synthesis.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:24.520]   So not only are our ears growing,
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:27.000]   but our noses are growing too.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.380]   My nose seems to be growing a lot, but then again,
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:31.200]   I did sports where I would get my nose broken,
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:32.460]   something I don't recommend.
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:34.180]   So I always point out, you don't get a nose like mine
[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:38.380]   doing yoga, but nonetheless, my nose is still growing
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:39.500]   and my ears are still growing,
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.100]   and I suspect as I get older, if I have the good fortune
[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:44.980]   of living into my 80s and 90s,
[01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:47.300]   my ears are going to continue to grow.
[01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:50.180]   A comparison between chronological age and biological age
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:52.340]   is something that's of really deep interest these days,
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:56.440]   and the work of David Sinclair at Harvard Medical School
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:59.220]   and others, so-called Horvath clocks
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:01.980]   that people have developed, have tapped into
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:05.580]   how the epigenome and the genome can give us some insight
[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:08.520]   into our biological age and how that compares
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:09.800]   to our chronological age.
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:11.980]   Most of us know our chronological age
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.840]   because we know when we were born,
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:16.920]   and we know where we are relative to that now.
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:21.920]   But you can start to make a little chart, if you like,
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:23.860]   about your rates of ear growth.
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:26.320]   Your rates of ear growth actually correlate pretty well
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.640]   with your rates of biological progression
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:32.440]   through this thing that we call life.
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.680]   So it's not something that we think about too often,
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:38.780]   but just like our DNA and our epigenome
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:41.460]   and some other markers of metabolic health
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:43.920]   and hormone health relate to our age,
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:45.980]   so does our collagen synthesis.
[01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:48.020]   And one of the places that shows up the most
[01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:50.260]   is in these two little goodies on the sides of our heads,
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:51.740]   which are our ears.
[01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:54.860]   So even though it's a little bit of a bizarre metric,
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:57.660]   it makes perfect sense in the biological context.
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:59.180]   So let's talk about balance
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:01.660]   and how to get better at balancing.
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:03.300]   The reason why we're talking about balance
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:04.960]   and how to get better at balancing
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:08.880]   in the episode about hearing is that all the goodies
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.540]   that are going to allow you to do that are in your ears.
[01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:15.300]   They're also in your brain,
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:17.680]   but they're mostly in your ears.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:19.940]   So as you recall from the beginning of this episode,
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:24.940]   you have two cochleas that are one on each side of your head
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:27.780]   and that's a little spiral snail-shaped thing
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:30.640]   that converts sound waves into electrical signals
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:33.340]   that the rest of your brain can understand.
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:34.680]   Right next to those,
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:37.420]   you have what are called semicircular canals.
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:41.420]   The semicircular canals can be best visualized
[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:45.340]   as thinking about three hula hoops with marbles in them.
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:48.320]   So imagine that you have a hula hoop
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:51.380]   and it's not filled with marbles all the way around,
[01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:54.740]   it's just got some marbles down there at the base, okay?
[01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:57.280]   So if you were to move that hula hoop around,
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:59.860]   the marbles will move around, [whooshing]
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:00.860]   okay?
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:01.960]   You've got three of those
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:04.760]   and each one of those hula hoops has these marbles
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.820]   that can move around.
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:10.320]   One of those hula hoops is positioned vertically
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.760]   with respect to gravity.
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:15.520]   So it's basically parallel to your nose.
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.520]   It's like this if you're watching on a video,
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.160]   but basically it's upright.
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:23.320]   Another one of those hula hoops is basically
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:27.340]   at a 90-degree angle to your nose.
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:29.740]   It's basically parallel to the floor
[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:33.640]   if you're standing upright now, if you're seated, okay?
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:37.200]   And the other one is kind of tilted
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:40.140]   about 45 degrees in between those.
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:42.860]   Now, why is the system there?
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:45.260]   Well, those marbles within each one of those hula hoops
[01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:49.720]   can move around, but they'll only move around
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:51.660]   if your head moves in a particular way.
[01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:54.520]   And there are three planes or three ways
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:56.300]   that your head can move.
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:37:00.080]   Your head can move up and down like I'm nodding right now.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.620]   So that's called pitch.
[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:05.700]   It's pitching forward or pitching back, okay?
[01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:08.480]   So it's a nod, up and down.
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.540]   Or I can shake my head no, side to side.
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:12.920]   That's called yaw.
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:16.000]   You pilots will be very familiar with this, yaw.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.260]   Not yawn, yaw.
[01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:22.220]   And then there's roll, tilting the head from side to side
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:24.780]   the way that a cute puppy might look at you
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:26.600]   from side to side, okay?
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:29.500]   Where if somebody doesn't really understand
[01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:30.660]   or believe what you're saying,
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:32.820]   they might tilt their head.
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:34.220]   Very common phenomenon.
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:35.500]   I mean, nobody does that to me,
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.640]   but they do that to each other.
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:41.920]   So pitch, yaw, and roll are the movements of the head
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.300]   in each of the three major planes of motion, as we say.
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:49.700]   And each one of those causes those marbles to move
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:54.460]   in one or two of the various hula hoops, okay?
[01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:57.220]   So if I move my head up and down, when I nod,
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:00.040]   one of those hula hoops, literally right now,
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.380]   the marbles are moving back and forth.
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:03.180]   They aren't actually marbles, by the way.
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:08.180]   These are little, kind of like little stones, basically,
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:10.980]   little calcium-like deposits.
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:13.780]   And when they roll back and forth,
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:17.740]   they deflect little hairs, little hair cells
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:18.900]   that aren't like the hair cells
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:21.000]   that we use for measuring sound waves.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.200]   They're not too different,
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:24.560]   but they are different from them,
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.020]   not like the hairs on our heads,
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:30.880]   but they're basically rolling past these little hair cells
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.560]   and causing them to deflect.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:36.140]   And when they deflect downward, the neurons,
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:37.300]   because hair cells are neurons,
[01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:40.680]   send information up to the brain.
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:42.480]   So if I move my head like this,
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:45.540]   there's a physical movement of these little stones
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:48.400]   in this hula hoop, as I'm referring to it,
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:49.840]   but they deflect these hairs,
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:52.720]   send those hairs, which are neurons,
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:54.900]   those hair cells, send information off to the brain.
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:56.620]   If I move my head from side to side,
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:58.580]   different little stones move.
[01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:00.860]   If I roll my head, different stones move.
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:03.860]   This is an exquisite system that exists
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:07.500]   in all animals that have a jaw.
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:10.580]   So any fish that has a jaw has this system.
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:12.260]   A puppy has this system.
[01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:16.080]   Any animal that has a jaw has this so-called balance system,
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:18.240]   which we call the vestibular system.
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:20.080]   One of the more important things to know
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:22.460]   about the vestibular, the balance system,
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:26.440]   is that it works together with the visual system.
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:30.000]   Let's say I hear something off to my left
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.760]   and I swing my head over to the left to see what it is.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:35.700]   There are two sources of information
[01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:38.060]   about where my head is relative to my body,
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:39.940]   and I need to know that.
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:43.900]   First of all, when I quickly move my head to the side,
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:46.380]   those little stones, as I'm referring to them,
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:47.740]   I realize they're not actually stones,
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:49.420]   but as I'm referring to them,
[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:52.380]   they quickly activate those hair cells
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:54.880]   in that one semicircular canal
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:56.880]   and send a signal off to my brain
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:58.720]   that my head just moved to the side like this.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.640]   Not that it went like this and pitched back
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:03.940]   or not that it tilted, but it just moved to the side.
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:08.700]   But also visual information slid past my field of view.
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:09.720]   I didn't have to think about it,
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:11.660]   but just slid past my field of view.
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:14.300]   And when those two signals combine,
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.600]   my eyes then lock to a particular location.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:21.240]   Now, if this is at all complicated,
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.780]   you can actually uncouple these things.
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:25.080]   It's very easy to do.
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:26.180]   You can do this right now.
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:27.860]   In fact, I'd like you to do this experiment
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:29.560]   if you're not already doing something else
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:30.820]   that requires your attention,
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:33.660]   and certainly don't do this if you're driving.
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:35.460]   You're going to sit down,
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:39.400]   and you're going to move your head to the left very slowly,
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.060]   with your eyes open.
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:45.360]   So you're going to move it very, very slowly.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.420]   The whole thing should take about five, six,
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:49.320]   maybe even 10 seconds to complete.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:53.680]   Okay, I just did it.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.940]   Now I'm going to do it very quickly.
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:57.100]   I'd like you to do it very quickly as well.
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.600]   Now do it slowly again.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:05.740]   Okay, what you probably noticed
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:08.560]   is that it's very uncomfortable to do it slowly,
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:12.020]   but you can do it very quickly
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:13.340]   without much discomfort at all.
[01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:14.940]   You just move your head to the side.
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:18.780]   The reason is when you move your head very slowly,
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:21.980]   those little stones at the base of that hula hoop,
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:24.000]   they don't get enough momentum to move.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.180]   So you're actually not generating this signal to the brain
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:29.200]   that your head is moving.
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:32.500]   And what you'll notice is that your eyes have to go boom,
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:35.300]   boom, boom, jumping over step by step.
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:37.260]   Whereas if you move your head really quickly,
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:38.440]   the signal gets off to your brain,
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:39.620]   and your eyes just go boom,
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:41.860]   right to the location you want to look at.
[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:46.280]   So moving your body slowly is actually very disruptive
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.940]   to the vestibular system.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:52.280]   And it's very disruptive to your visual system.
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:54.580]   Now, if you've ever had the misfortune of being on a boat
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:57.040]   and you're going through big oscillations on the boat,
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.660]   for those of you folks that get seasick,
[01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:01.460]   this can actually make certain people seasick
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:02.760]   just to hear about it.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:05.680]   That was big oscillations going up and down
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.000]   and up and down.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.740]   Those are very disruptive.
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:09.980]   We'll talk about nausea in a minute
[01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:12.060]   and how to offset that kind of nausea.
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:12.980]   I get pretty seasick,
[01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:16.140]   but there are ways that you can deal with this.
[01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:17.460]   But this is incredible,
[01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:19.460]   because what it means is it's a purely physical system
[01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:22.020]   of these little stones rolling around in there
[01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:24.680]   and directing where your eyes should go.
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.140]   Okay, so you can do this also just by looking up.
[01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:29.200]   So let's just say you're sitting in a chair.
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:30.980]   You're going to look up towards the ceiling
[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:32.300]   and your eyes will just go there.
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:34.180]   You're doing this eyes open and you look down.
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:38.900]   Now try doing it really, really slowly.
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:44.240]   Some people even get motion sick doing this,
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:46.900]   which if you do, then just stop, okay?
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:49.080]   So you can do this also to the side,
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.480]   although it works best if you're moving your head
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:55.320]   from side to side or nodding up and down.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:56.440]   So what we're doing here
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.280]   is we're uncoupling these two mechanisms.
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:42:59.160]   We're pulling them apart,
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:00.920]   the visual part and the vestibular part,
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:05.000]   just to illustrate to you that normally these mechanisms
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.000]   in your inner ear tell your eyes where to go,
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.540]   but as well, your eyes tell your balance system,
[01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:15.420]   your vestibular system, how to function.
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:18.000]   So I'd like you to do a different experiment.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.520]   I'm not going to do it right now, but basically stand up.
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:22.360]   If you get the opportunity,
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:23.780]   you can do this safely wherever you are.
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:25.080]   You're going to stand up
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:28.000]   and you're going to look forward about 10, 12 feet.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.500]   Pick a point on a wall or you can, anywhere that you like.
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:33.680]   If you're out in public, just do it anyway.
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:36.720]   Just tell them you're listening to "Cuberman Lab Podcast"
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:38.900]   and someone's telling you to do it.
[01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:40.280]   Anyway, if you don't want to do it, don't do it,
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.480]   but basically do it.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:45.120]   Stand on one leg and lift up the other leg.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.640]   You can bend your knee if you like,
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:50.340]   and just look off into the distance about 10, 12 feet.
[01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:53.560]   If you can do that, if you can stand on one leg,
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.740]   now close your eyes.
[01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:58.200]   Chances are you're going to suddenly feel
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:00.360]   what scientists call postural sway.
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.480]   You're going to start swaying around a lot.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:06.480]   It is very hard to balance with your eyes closed.
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:07.840]   You might think, well, and if you think about that,
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:09.080]   it's like, why is that?
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.080]   That's crazy.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.920]   Why would it be that it's hard to balance
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:12.740]   with your eyes closed?
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:15.800]   Well, information about the visual world
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:18.720]   also feeds back onto this vestibular system.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:20.720]   So the vestibular system informs your vision
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.120]   and tells you where to move your eyes,
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:24.080]   and your eyes and their positioning
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:27.000]   tell your balance system, your vestibular system,
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.660]   how it should function.
[01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:31.020]   So there's a really cool way
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:33.680]   that you can learn to optimize balance.
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:34.800]   You're not going to try and do this
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:37.300]   by learning to balance with your eyes closed.
[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:41.040]   What you can do is you can raise one leg,
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:43.000]   and you can look at a short distance,
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.240]   maybe off to just the distance that your thumb would be
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:46.700]   if you were to reach your arm out in front of you,
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:48.560]   although you don't necessarily have to put your thumb
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:49.400]   in front of you.
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.540]   So maybe just about two feet in front of you.
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:52.680]   Then while still balancing,
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:56.240]   you're going to step your vision out a further distance,
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:57.420]   and then a further distance,
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:58.840]   and as far as you can possibly see
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:00.560]   in the environment that you're in.
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:03.200]   And then you're going to march it back to you.
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.540]   Now, what the literature shows
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:07.560]   is that this kind of balance training
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.580]   where you incorporate the visual system
[01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:14.140]   and extending out and then marching back in,
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:16.880]   the point at which you direct your visual focus,
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.480]   sends robust information about the relationship
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:24.100]   between your visual world and your balance system.
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:25.460]   And of course, the balance system includes
[01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:28.540]   not just these hula hoops, these semicircular canals,
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:30.420]   but they communicate with the cerebellum,
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:31.640]   this little so-called mini brain,
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:33.900]   it actually means mini brain in the back of your brain,
[01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:35.420]   combines that with visual information
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:37.520]   and your map of the body surface.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:44.100]   That pattern of training is very beneficial
[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:47.300]   for enhancing your ability to balance
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:50.100]   because the ability to balance is in part
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:53.300]   the activation of particular postural muscles,
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:57.220]   but just as much, perhaps even more so,
[01:45:57.220 --> 01:46:02.220]   it's about being able to adjust those postural muscles,
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:03.700]   excuse me, it's about the ability
[01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:05.620]   to adjust those postural muscles
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:08.900]   as you experience changes in your visual world.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:12.180]   And one of the most robust ways that you can engage changes
[01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:15.180]   in your visual world is through your own movement.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:19.280]   And so most people are not trying to balance in place.
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:20.540]   They're not just trying to stand there
[01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:22.260]   like a statue on one leg.
[01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:24.180]   Most of what we think about when we think about balance
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:26.760]   is for sake of sport or dynamic balance
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:28.100]   of being able to break ourselves
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:30.820]   and when we're lunging in one particular direction
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:32.180]   to stop ourselves, that is,
[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:33.900]   and then to move in another direction
[01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:36.700]   or for skateboarding or surfing or cycling
[01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:39.160]   or any number of different things, gymnastics.
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:41.940]   So the visual system is the primary input
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:43.340]   by which you develop balance,
[01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:46.460]   but you can't do it just with the visual system.
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:49.300]   So what I'm recommending is if you're interested
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:50.700]   in cultivating a sense of balance,
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:52.000]   understand the relationship
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.440]   between these semicircular canals.
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:58.820]   Understand that they are both driving eye movements
[01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:01.100]   and they are driven by eye movements.
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:03.060]   It's a reciprocal relationship.
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:06.500]   And then even just two or three minutes a day
[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:10.020]   or every once in a while, even three times a week,
[01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:13.500]   maybe five minutes, maybe 10 minutes, you pick.
[01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:14.820]   But if you want to enhance balance,
[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:18.860]   you have to combine changes in your visual environment
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:21.180]   with a static posture, standing on one leg
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:23.600]   and shifting your visual environment,
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:28.600]   or static visual view, looking at one thing
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:32.640]   and changing your body posture, okay?
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.160]   So those two things we now know
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:37.040]   from the scientific literature combine
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.020]   in order to give an enhanced sense of balance.
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:42.620]   And there's a really nice paper that was published in 2015
[01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:45.560]   called "Effects of Balance Training on Balance Performance."
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:47.940]   This was in healthy adults.
[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:50.980]   It's a systematic review and a meta-analysis.
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:53.500]   A meta-analysis is when you combine a lot of literature
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:54.660]   from a lot of different papers
[01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:56.640]   and extract the really robust
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:59.300]   and the less robust statistical effects.
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:02.080]   So it's a really nice paper as well.
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:04.740]   There are some papers out there, for instance,
[01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:06.760]   a comparison of static balance
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:09.360]   and the role of vision in the elite athletes.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:11.540]   This is essentially the paper that I've extracted
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:14.540]   most of the information that I just gave you from.
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:18.220]   And that paper, and there are some others as well,
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:19.840]   but basically I distilled them down
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:20.820]   into their core components.
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:23.900]   The core components are move your vision around
[01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:28.080]   while staying static still, but in a balanced position,
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:29.340]   like standing on one leg.
[01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:30.620]   Could be something more complicated
[01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:33.420]   if you're somebody who can do more complicated movements.
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:37.160]   Unilateral movements seem to be important.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:40.400]   So standing on one leg as opposed to both, right?
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:43.420]   Or trying to generate some tilt
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:45.420]   is another way to go about it, or imbalance,
[01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:48.100]   meaning one limb asymmetrically being activated
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:49.780]   compared to the other limb.
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:54.420]   And then the other way to encourage or to cultivate
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:56.700]   and build up this vestibular system
[01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:57.960]   and your sense of balance
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:01.420]   actually involves movement itself, acceleration.
[01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:03.420]   So that's what we're going to talk about now.
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:05.320]   So up until now, I've been talking about balance
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:06.700]   only in the static sense,
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:08.440]   like standing on one leg, for instance,
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:11.060]   but that's a very artificial situation.
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:13.160]   Even though you can train balance that way,
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:15.820]   most people who want to enhance their sense of balance
[01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:18.780]   for sport or dance or some other endeavor
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:21.520]   want to engage balance in a dynamic way,
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:24.180]   meaning moving through lots of different planes of movement,
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:26.860]   maybe even sometimes while squatting down low
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:28.140]   or jumping and landing
[01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:31.360]   or making trajectories that are different angles.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.980]   For that, we need to consider that the vestibular system
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:39.540]   also cares about acceleration.
[01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:40.960]   So it cares about head position.
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:42.620]   It cares about eye position
[01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:44.700]   and where the eyes are and where you're looking,
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:47.840]   but it also cares about what direction you're moving
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.380]   and how fast.
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:52.420]   And one of the best things that you can do
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:54.860]   to enhance your sense of balance
[01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:59.400]   is to start to bring together your visual system,
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:02.300]   the semicircular canals of the inner ear,
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:05.060]   and what we call linear acceleration.
[01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:08.880]   So if I move forward in space rigidly upright,
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:11.000]   it's a vastly different situation
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.240]   than if I'm leaning to the side.
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:19.160]   One of the best ways to cultivate a better sense of balance,
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:23.000]   literally within the sense organs and the neurons
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.960]   and the biology of the brain is to get into modes
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:31.940]   where we are accelerating forward, typically it's forward,
[01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:35.640]   while also tilted with respect to gravity.
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:38.500]   Now, this would be the carve on a skateboard
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:40.720]   or on a surfboard or a snowboard.
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:44.260]   This would be the taking a corner on a bike
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:46.780]   while being able to lean safely, of course,
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:50.480]   lean into the turn so that your head is actually tilted
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:52.840]   with respect to the earth.
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:55.740]   So anytime that we are rigidly upright,
[01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:59.140]   we aren't really exercising the vestibular system
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:00.420]   and balance.
[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:03.120]   This is why, you know, you see people in the gym on these,
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:04.660]   what are those Bonshi balls?
[01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:07.460]   Bonshi balls, the one that the guys roll in the park, right?
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.480]   Bonshi balls where they're balancing back and forth,
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:11.900]   that will work the small stabilizing muscles.
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:13.820]   But what I'm talking about is getting into modes
[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:17.240]   where you actually tilt the body and the head
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:19.420]   with respect to earth.
[01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:24.060]   What I mean is with respect to earth's gravitational pull.
[01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:27.320]   Now, the cerebellum is a very interesting structure
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:29.800]   because not only is it involved in balance,
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:33.020]   but it's also involved in skill learning
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:35.940]   and in generating timing of movements.
[01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:39.020]   It's a fascinating structure deserving of an entire episode
[01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:41.760]   or several episodes all on its own.
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:44.960]   But some of the outputs of the cerebellum,
[01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:47.800]   meaning the neurons in the cell cerebellum get inputs,
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:50.480]   but they also send information out.
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:53.400]   The outputs of the cerebellum are strongly linked
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:56.520]   to areas of the brain that release neuromodulators
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:58.880]   that make us feel really good,
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:01.320]   in particular, serotonin and dopamine.
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:05.020]   And this is an early emerging subfield within neuroscience,
[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:07.880]   but a lot of what are called the non-motor outputs
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:11.200]   of the cerebellum have a profound influence,
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.640]   not just on our ability to learn how to balance better,
[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:18.420]   but also how we feel overall.
[01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:20.740]   So for you exercisers out there,
[01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:22.680]   I do hope people are getting regular,
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:23.900]   healthy amounts of exercise.
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:26.560]   We've talked about what that means in previous episodes.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:29.080]   So at least 150 minutes a week of endurance work,
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:29.920]   some strength training,
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:31.800]   a minimum of five sets per body part
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:33.340]   to maintain musculature.
[01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:34.880]   Even if you don't want to grow muscles,
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:37.320]   you want to do that in order to maintain healthy strength
[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:39.440]   and bones, et cetera.
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:42.540]   If you're doing that, but you're only doing things
[01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:44.720]   like curls in the gym, squats in the gym,
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:47.440]   riding the Peloton, or even if you're outside running
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:49.440]   and you're getting forward acceleration,
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:51.240]   but you're never actually getting tilted, right?
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:52.800]   You're never actually getting tilted
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:56.400]   with respect to Earth's gravitational pull.
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:58.560]   You're not really exercising
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:03.200]   and getting the most out of your nervous system.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:07.840]   Activation of the cerebellum in this way of being tilted
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.880]   or the head being tilted and the body being tilted
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.960]   while in acceleration, typically forward acceleration,
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:14.920]   but sometimes side to side,
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:18.280]   has a profound and positive effect
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:20.240]   on our sense of mood and wellbeing.
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:22.840]   And as I talked about in a previous episode,
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:26.180]   it can also enhance our ability to learn information
[01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:29.600]   in the period after generating those tilts
[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:31.360]   and the acceleration.
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:33.800]   And that's because the cerebellum has these outputs
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:34.840]   to these areas of the brain
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:37.560]   that release these neuromodulators like serotonin
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:41.440]   and dopamine, and they make us feel really good.
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:44.160]   I think this is one of the reasons why growing up,
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:47.560]   I had some friends, some of whom might've been
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:50.240]   the world heavyweight champions of laziness
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:53.800]   for essentially everything except they would wake up
[01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:56.320]   at 4.30 in the morning to go surf.
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:00.080]   They would drive, they would get up so early to go surf.
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:02.400]   It's not just surfers, and some surfers, by the way,
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:04.680]   I should point out, are not lazy humans.
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:06.040]   They do a lot of other things.
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:08.940]   But I knew people that couldn't be motivated to do anything,
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:13.120]   but they were highly driven to get into these experiences
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:15.200]   of forward acceleration while tilted
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:16.580]   with respect to gravity.
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:21.120]   Likewise with snowboarding or skiing or cycling.
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:25.800]   Those modes of exercise seem to have an outsized effect
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:30.200]   both on our wellbeing and our ability to translate
[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:33.640]   the vestibular balance that we achieve in those endeavors
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:37.100]   to our ability to balance while doing other things.
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:39.680]   So, and I don't mean psychological balance necessarily,
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:41.540]   I mean physical balance.
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:43.440]   So for those of you that don't think of yourselves
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:46.960]   as very coordinated or with very good balance,
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:49.000]   getting into these modes of acceleration,
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.720]   forward movement or lateral movement while getting tilted,
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:54.220]   even if you have to do it slowly, could be beneficial.
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:56.540]   I do believe, and the scientific literature points
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:58.720]   to the fact that it will be beneficial
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:02.500]   for cultivating better sense of physical balance.
[01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:04.440]   It can really build up the circuits
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.280]   of this vestibular system.
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:08.800]   And then of course the feel-good components
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:12.340]   of acceleration while tilted or while getting the head
[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:16.200]   into different orientations relative to gravity.
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:18.740]   Well, that's the explanation for roller coasters.
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:20.040]   Some people hate roller coasters.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.960]   They make them feel nauseous.
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:24.840]   Many people love roller coasters.
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.720]   And one of the reasons they love roller coasters
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:30.260]   is because of the way that when you get the body,
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:31.880]   even if you're not generating the movement,
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:33.980]   you get the body into forward acceleration
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:36.480]   and you're going upside down and tilted to the side
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:39.220]   as the tracks go from side to side and tilt, et cetera,
[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:42.800]   you're getting activation of these deeper brain nuclei
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:45.280]   that trigger the release of neuromodulators
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:47.200]   that just make us feel really, really good.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.360]   In fact, some people get a long arc, a long duration
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:53.080]   kind of buzz from having gone through those experiences.
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:54.760]   Some people who hate roller coasters
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:57.960]   are probably getting nauseous just hearing about that.
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:01.740]   So I encourage people to get into modes of acceleration
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:03.280]   while tilted every once in a while,
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:04.660]   provided you can do it safely.
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:08.560]   It's an immensely powerful way to build up your skills
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:10.120]   in the realm of balance.
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:14.040]   And it's also, for most people, very, very pleasing.
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:16.620]   It feels really good because of the chemical relationship
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:21.200]   between forward acceleration and head tilt and body tilt.
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:23.520]   Now, speaking of feeling nauseous,
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:27.240]   some people suffer from vertigo.
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:28.840]   Some people feel dizzy.
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:30.240]   Some people get lightheaded.
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:33.900]   An important question to ask yourself always
[01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:36.940]   if you're feeling quote unquote dizzy or lightheaded is,
[01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:39.620]   are you dizzy or are you lightheaded?
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:41.700]   Now, we're not going to diagnose anything here
[01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:43.420]   because there's just no way we can do that.
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:45.300]   This is essentially me shouting into a tunnel
[01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:46.800]   so we don't know what's going on
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:48.240]   with each and every one of you.
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:51.860]   But if ever you feel that your world is spinning
[01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:56.520]   but that you can focus on your thumb, for instance,
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:58.580]   but the rest of the world is spinning
[01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:00.460]   and your thumb is stationary,
[01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:01.920]   that's called being dizzy.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.140]   Now, if you feel like you're falling
[01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:07.960]   or that you feel like you need to get down onto the ground
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:12.060]   because you feel lightheaded, that's being lightheaded.
[01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:14.340]   And oftentimes with language, we don't distinguish
[01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:16.580]   between being dizzy and being lightheaded.
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:19.160]   Now, there are a lot of ways that dizziness
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:21.000]   and lightheadedness can occur.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.440]   And I don't even want to begin to guess
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:24.820]   at the number of different things and ways
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:26.740]   that it could happen for those of you that suffer from it
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:28.920]   because it could be any number of them.
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:31.920]   But oftentimes if people are lightheaded,
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:33.200]   yes, it could be low blood sugar.
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:35.820]   It could also be that you're dehydrated.
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:38.720]   It could also be that you are low in electrolytes.
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:40.680]   We talked about this in a previous episode,
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:43.280]   but we will talk about it more in a future episode.
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:46.920]   Many people have too little sodium in their system, salt,
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:49.360]   and that's why they feel lightheaded.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:51.220]   I have family members who for years
[01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:53.780]   thought they had disrupted blood sugar.
[01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:56.960]   They would get shaky, jittery, lightheaded,
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:59.160]   feel like they were nauseous, et cetera.
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:02.160]   And simply the addition of a little sea salt
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:04.320]   to their water remedied the problem entirely.
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:06.680]   I don't think it's going to remedy every issue
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:08.940]   of lightheadedness out there by any stretch,
[01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:12.020]   but just the addition of salt in this particular case
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:14.600]   helped the person and they are not alone.
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:16.440]   Many people who think that they have low blood sugar
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:19.640]   actually are lightheaded because of low electrolytes.
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:22.920]   And because of the way that salt carries water
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:26.800]   into the system and creates changes in blood volume, et cetera
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:30.480]   low sodium can often be a source of lightheadedness
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:33.440]   as can low blood sugar and of course other things as well.
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:36.020]   Now for dizziness or seasickness,
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:38.880]   we were all taught that you need to pick a point
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:41.700]   on the horizon and focus on it,
[01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:44.280]   but actually that's not correct.
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:49.460]   It is true that if you are down in the cabin of a boat
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:51.140]   or you're on the lower deck
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:53.760]   and all you can see are things up close to you
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:57.360]   that getting sloshed around like so
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:59.840]   or the boat going up and down like so,
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:00.860]   I think I'm getting a little seasick
[01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:02.660]   even as I do this and I describe it.
[01:59:02.660 --> 01:59:09.120]   Focusing on things close to you can be problematic.
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:12.380]   And in that case, the advice to go up on deck
[01:59:12.380 --> 01:59:15.900]   and get fresh air and to look off into the horizon,
[01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:17.600]   that part is correct.
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:20.000]   But focusing your eyes on a particular location
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.080]   on the horizon is effectively like trying
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:26.260]   to move very slowly as I had you do before
[01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:28.240]   where you're trying to move your head very slowly
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:30.480]   while fixating on one location.
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:31.920]   Your eyes and your balance system
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:33.920]   were designed to move together.
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:36.800]   So really what you want to do is allow your visual system
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:40.220]   to track with your vestibular system.
[01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:43.440]   This is why sitting in the back of an Uber or a taxi
[01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:45.300]   and being on your phone
[01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:47.720]   can make you suddenly feel very nauseous.
[01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:49.700]   Sometimes the cabs, particularly in New York City,
[01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:51.000]   they have a lot of occluders.
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.160]   They have a lot of stuff blocking your field of view.
[01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:55.000]   There's usually a little portal out there
[01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:59.240]   where you can see out to the front windshield,
[01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:00.280]   but there's all this stuff now.
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:01.800]   Television's in the back seat
[02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:04.120]   and you're watching that television and the cab is moving.
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:06.300]   You're in linear acceleration
[02:00:06.300 --> 02:00:09.000]   and sometimes you're taking corners, you're braking,
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.680]   so then your vestibular system has to adjust to that.
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:14.520]   If you're looking at your phone or a book,
[02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:16.960]   or even if you're talking to somebody,
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:18.360]   actually, I'm starting to feel a little nauseous
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:19.200]   just talking about it.
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:20.880]   I promise I'm not going to finish this episode
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:23.860]   by vomiting at the end, at least not here.
[02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:28.120]   But what can happen is that you're uncoupling
[02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:31.120]   the visual information from your motion,
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:32.860]   from your vestibular information.
[02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:34.160]   You want those to be coupled.
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:36.920]   This is why a lot of people have to drive.
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:38.400]   They can't be in the passenger seat
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:39.240]   because when you drive,
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:41.480]   you also get what's called proprioceptive feedback.
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:44.920]   Your body is sending signals also to the vestibular system
[02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:46.880]   about where you are in space.
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:48.060]   When you're the passenger,
[02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:51.120]   you're just getting jolted around as the person is driving.
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:53.340]   And if you're looking at your phone, it's even worse.
[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:54.660]   And if you're looking at the occluder
[02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:58.660]   between you and the two front seats, that's even worse.
[02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:01.360]   So this is why staring out the front windshield is great,
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:03.300]   but you don't want to fixate, okay?
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:05.900]   So hopefully I spared a few people
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:07.560]   and hopefully a few cab drivers
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:10.300]   of having people get sick in their cars or Ubers.
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:12.360]   Let your visual system
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:15.320]   and your vestibular system work together.
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:18.560]   If appropriate, get into linear acceleration
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:20.820]   and you'll improve your sense of balance.
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:24.300]   Once again, we've covered a tremendous amount of information.
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:25.940]   Now you know how you hear,
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:29.560]   how you make sense of the sounds in your environment,
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:31.160]   how those come into your ears
[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:33.420]   and how your brain processes them.
[02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:35.080]   In addition, we talked about things
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:38.100]   like low-level white noise and even binaural beats,
[02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:40.740]   which can be used to enhance certain brain states,
[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:44.180]   certain rhythms within the brain and even dopamine release
[02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:46.820]   in ways that allow you to learn better.
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:48.500]   And we talked about the balance system
[02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:50.300]   and this incredible relationship
[02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:52.940]   between your vestibular apparatus,
[02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:55.160]   meaning the portions of your inner ear
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:56.520]   that are responsible for balance
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:59.560]   and your visual system and gravity.
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:02.780]   And you can use those to enhance your learning as well,
[02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:05.620]   as well as just to enhance your sense of balance.

[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:32.100]   During this episode, I mentioned some supplements.
[02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:33.220]   We partnered with Thorne
[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:35.820]   because Thorne has the very highest levels of stringency
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:38.260]   with respect to the quality of their ingredients
[02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:41.260]   and accuracy about the amounts of those ingredients
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:42.960]   contained within their products.
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:45.480]   If you'd like to see the products that I take from Thorne,
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:50.480]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:54.800]   So that's thorne.com/u/huberman
