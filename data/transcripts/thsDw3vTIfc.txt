[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Assuming that you spend enough travel on the card such that you can use your
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   points to cancel out that travel, which is different than a chase bonus where
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.880]   you have to spend those points in the portal and book in the portal, U.S.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.260]   Bank also does that, but you can just book the travel and they'll let
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.440]   you credit it off your statement.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.300]   So that makes mobile wallet and travel spending four and a half percent
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.600]   cash back, which is really amazing.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.040]   I've actually heard people booking travel, redeeming the points to credit
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.740]   it off and then canceling it if it's a refundable airfare and then still
[00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.960]   being able to keep the points.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.460]   But I don't think it would be that hard to make sure that however much you spend
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.340]   on the card, you put four and a half percent of your spending into the travel
