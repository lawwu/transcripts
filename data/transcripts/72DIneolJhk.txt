[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   Donnie from New Mexico writes in to ask, "Pastor John, what does it mean to be made in the
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.800]   image of God?
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.920]   And are there differences between it before the fall of man, after the fall, and after
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.620]   being born again?"
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:28.760]   We are created in the image of God, and the fall of human beings into sin in Genesis 3
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.440]   did not destroy it, but defaced it.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.440]   That's my premise.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.720]   The texts for being in the image of God and staying in the image of God would be Genesis
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.720]   1.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.480]   God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and female he
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.400]   created them, so man and woman equally in the image of God as we were made.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.800]   And then Genesis 9, after the fall, "Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.480]   be shed for God made man in his own image."
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.280]   In other words, here you have the image of God functioning ethically, morally, in Genesis
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.920]   9 as a warrant for capital punishment, even though all human beings have now become sinners.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.600]   So being a sinner does not mean we have ceased to be in the image of God.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:35.000]   Or same thing in James 3, with the tongue we bless our Lord and Father, and with it
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.680]   we curse people who are made in the likeness of God.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.320]   So in other words, James is using being in the likeness or the image of God in our present
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.760]   condition as an argument, while we shouldn't curse each other.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.720]   So yes, we're created in God's image, and yes, we stay in God's image.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:04.440]   And the reason I say it's defaced and needs some kind of repair or restoration is because
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.520]   that's the way our salvation is described by Paul in Colossians 3.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:19.320]   He says, "We have put on the new person, the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.560]   after the image of its creator."
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.200]   So Paul's mindset is, we are in the image of God, but oh, how corrupt and fallen and
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.080]   sinful and defaced this image is.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.920]   And now, with our redemption in Christ, we have put on the new man, we've put on Christ,
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:49.120]   and this now becomes a process of shaping us, making us again into the image of our
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.120]   creator.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.600]   So the last thing is, well, what is it?
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.160]   That was what the question was.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.960]   What are you talking about?
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.120]   In what sense are we in the image of God?
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.760]   And historically, people have said it's things like our morality, our sense of right and
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.520]   wrong, or our rationality, our ability to reason, or our spirituality, our ability to
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.640]   relate to God, or our aesthetic sense.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:23.120]   You don't find too many monkeys creating Mona Lisas, or our judicial sense, the whole legal
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.760]   system that we're creating, a sense of right and wrong and justice and injustice.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.080]   And I think, frankly, all of those are true and aspects of what it means to be in God's
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.080]   image.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.120]   But the simplest thing, the plainest thing, in fact, for me, the most practical thing,
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:52.320]   the way it has an actual effect on my life is to say, "Images are created to image."
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:59.560]   If you create an image, if you make a sculpture of someone, you do it to display something
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.920]   about that someone.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.840]   You put it in the square in the middle of town, and you want people to look at it, notice
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.080]   it, think about that person, think something about them, that they were noble or strong
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.040]   or wise or courageous or something.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.320]   Now what would it mean if you created seven billion statues of yourself and put them all
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.080]   over the world?
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.520]   It would mean you would want people to notice you.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:34.960]   God created us in his image so that we would display or reflect or communicate who he is,
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.720]   how great he is, and what he's like.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.720]   And so here's the picture in my mind.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:53.280]   I was created like a mirror, a mirror that was supposed to be 45 degrees with the clear
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.560]   reflective side pointing upward so that as God shone on it at the 45 degree angle, it
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.280]   would bounce off and it would make a 90 degree turn and be reflected out into the world.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:14.720]   And at the fall, Satan persuaded me that my image is more beautiful than God's image,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.840]   and so I flipped the mirror over.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.320]   Now the black backside is towards God, doesn't reflect anything.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.880]   Instead, the mirror casts a shadow in the shape of itself on the ground, and I fell
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.000]   in love with the shadow.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.720]   That's what happened.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.800]   And we've been loving ourselves ever since.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.280]   And in salvation, two things happen.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.600]   The mirror gets turned around and we see the glory of God again, and the defilement that
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.380]   had grown over the face of it gets wiped off gradually and we begin to reflect God.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:54.520]   So I think being created in the image of God means that we image God, we reflect God, we
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.280]   live in a way, we think in a way, we feel in a way, we speak in a way that calls attention
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.400]   to the brightness of the glory of God.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.880]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.200]   And for more on this topic of the image of God, Pastor John has two old articles in the
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   DG Library.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.720]   One is titled "Reflections on the Concept of Self-Worth," which was published in 1976,
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.000]   and the other is an academic article simply titled "The Image of God," which was published
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.880]   in 1971.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.160]   Both can be found online for free in the resource library at DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.120]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, thanks for listening.
