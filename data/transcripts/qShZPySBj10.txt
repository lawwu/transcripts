[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.200]   A listener named Beth writes in, "Hi Pastor John, I'm a woman who enjoys being a woman.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.680]   I have no desire to be a man or to compete to be better than men at being masculine.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.880]   For a couple of years now I have felt drawn to police work as a vocation.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.520]   I am unmarried and should I become married and my husband object, I would discontinue
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.300]   work as a police officer.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.880]   At this point my question is a question of principle.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.800]   Can a single Christian woman who is a complementarian become a police officer?"
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.360]   I love Beth's spirit and I hope I can be of help without telling her what she should do.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.760]   Exactly.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.320]   Here's how I've approached these kinds of issues because police officer is just one
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.800]   of so many questions that arise.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.360]   If you want to be a godly man or woman and walk in paths of relationships with the opposite
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.480]   sex that are pleasing to the Lord.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.020]   And I've tried to wrestle with the scriptures, which is, I hope and pray, my final authority
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.420]   in these matters, and I've come up with a general definition of what I think the heart
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.460]   of mature manhood and the heart of mature womanhood are.
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.140]   And then I've argued these and spelled them out in a little book called "What's the Difference?"
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.340]   And these are really foundational for me and they help me answer a lot of questions.
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.620]   Let me give you the definitions and then try to show how they apply to this.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.580]   At the heart of mature manhood is a sense of benevolent responsibility to lead, a sense
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.980]   of responsibility to lead, provide for, and protect women in ways appropriate to a man's
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.940]   differing relationships.
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.140]   The postman won't relate to the lady at the door the way the husband will, but he will
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.560]   be a man.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:13.340]   At the heart of mature womanhood is a freeing disposition to affirm, receive, and nurture
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.020]   strength and leadership from worthy men in ways appropriate to a woman's differing relationships.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.860]   So I take a whole book, a little book, to unpack those two definitions.
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.660]   Now in the home, the Bible makes plain that these definitions imply a leadership role
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.700]   for men that bear the burden of loving, leading the wife like Christ, and implies in the church
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.620]   that men bear the responsibility to lead the church as elders.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.740]   But what about outside the church, in thousands of possible roles that men and women may fill
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.620]   in society?
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.460]   And my sense is that it is unwise to make a list of women's jobs and men's jobs.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.620]   There's simply too much diversity and too much flexibility in how many jobs there are
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.660]   and how the jobs are done and what the varying relationships with men and women are in all
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.660]   the various jobs.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.060]   It just won't work to try to make a list like that.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.380]   So instead of a list of whether a policeman is on the man job or the woman job list, instead
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.740]   of a list, I've tried to provide guidelines for men and women who sincerely want to be
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.180]   submissive to the Bible, and that really is the key.
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.020]   If a person approaches this and just says, "I'm going to do what I want to do," then
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.580]   I don't have much to say to them on this score.
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.780]   But if the aim really is, "Does the Bible have something to say here at the root level
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.780]   of my manhood and my womanhood that would affect the kind of work I do in relationship
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.860]   to the opposite sex," then I want to submit to that and go for it, because that would
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.620]   be God's best for me.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.740]   So here's one possible set of criteria that I've tried to develop over the years in assessing
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.460]   which roles are appropriate for men and women, which aren't.
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.460]   It seems to me that all the acts of influence or guidance or leadership between men and
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:24.300]   women can be described along two continuums, and I'll mention these and then show how
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.300]   they apply.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:35.620]   There's a continuum from very personal influence, very eye-to-eye, close, up front, personal
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.900]   influence to non-personal influence.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.900]   And the other continuum is very directive, you know, commands and forcefulness, directive
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.020]   influence to very non-directive influence.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.420]   And here's my conviction.
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.500]   To the degree that a woman's influence over man, guidance of man, leadership of man, is
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:10.640]   a personal and directive, it will generally offend a man's good, God-given sense of responsibility
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.220]   and leadership and thus controvert God's created order.
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:26.740]   To an extent, a woman's leadership or influence may be personal and non-directive or directive
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.060]   and non-personal, but I don't think we should push the limits.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.260]   I mean, I don't think those would necessarily push the limits of what is appropriate.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:44.940]   That's my general paradigm of guidance, and you can see how flexible it is, how imprecise
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.940]   it is.
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.860]   So let me give some examples.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.080]   A woman who is a civil engineer may design a traffic pattern in a city so that she's
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.140]   deciding which streets are one way, and therefore she is influencing, indeed controlling in
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.140]   one sense, all the male drivers all day long.
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:10.780]   But this influence is so non-personal that it seems to me that the feminine-masculine
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.700]   dynamic is utterly negligible in this kind of relationship.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.740]   On the other hand, husband and wife, very personal, and hence the clear teaching of
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.540]   the New Testament that the man should give leadership in the home, and she give glad
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.060]   partnership in supporting and helping that leadership come into its own.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.260]   On the other hand, some influence is very directive, and some is non-directive.
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:46.020]   For example, a drill sergeant might epitomize directive influence over the privates in the
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:55.420]   platoon, and it would be hard for me to see how a woman could be a drill sergeant - right
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:02.420]   face, left face, keep your mouth shut, private - over men without violating their sense of
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.980]   manhood and her sense of womanhood.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:11.340]   And I know that the world we live in has gone completely the other way on these things.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:18.660]   So I know I'm an absolute dinosaur when I'm speaking these things, and I doubt that moving
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:25.700]   away from dinosaur truth has been good for the world or will be good in the long run,
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:34.560]   no matter how sweeping the day is in regard to making negligible sexuality and gender
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.580]   issues in role relationships.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.620]   So if you combine those two continuums that I just mentioned, I would say it like this.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:51.340]   If a woman's job involves a good deal of directives toward men, they'll need, in general, I think,
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:58.380]   to be non-personal, or men and women won't flourish, I don't think, in the long run in
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:05.640]   that relationship without compromising profound biblical and psychological issues.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.680]   And conversely, if a woman's relationship to a man is very personal, then the way she
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:18.100]   offers guidance and influence will, I think, need to be more non-directive.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:25.480]   And my own view is that there are some roles in society that will strain godly manhood
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.380]   and womanhood to the breaking point.
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.100]   But I leave women and men in those roles to sort that out.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.720]   I've never tried to make that list.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:44.720]   So the key is, do they deeply want to shape their whole lives by Scripture?
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.600]   And we may come to different views on some roles, but that submission to Scripture is
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.480]   a great common ground.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.480]   So good.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.480]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.120]   And there was mention of the book, "What is the Difference?"
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:03.060]   Which is a little 90-page book you can download and read free of charge at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.620]   It's titled, "What's the Difference?"
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:13.580]   Tomorrow a listener asks, "How culturally up-to-date must my pastor be, especially when
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.380]   it comes to getting a handle on all the ethical questions in the news?"
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.780]   And I know a lot of pastors feel perpetually behind and out of touch with the news cycle,
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.820]   and especially this summer.
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.460]   And John Pfeiffer will have some refreshing counsel for pastors.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.460]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.460]   We'll see you tomorrow.
