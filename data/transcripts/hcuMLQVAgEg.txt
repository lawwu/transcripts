[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.840]   My name is Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.920]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.940]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.760]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.560]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.700]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.800]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.280]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.840]   to the general public.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.360]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.280]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.880]   Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.960]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.780]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.520]   to help you better understand your body
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.480]   and inform your health goals.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.000]   I'm a big believer in getting blood tests taken
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.440]   because it's simply the only way to get in-depth data
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.080]   about your metabolic factors, hormones,
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.000]   all the things that inform your immediate
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.840]   and long-term health.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.360]   Nowadays, there are also excellent DNA tests
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.760]   that can further inform you about your immediate
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.160]   and long-term health.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.680]   Now, the problem with most blood tests out there
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.240]   is that you get information back,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.160]   you get a lot of numbers,
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.820]   and they'll tell you whether or not your numbers
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.160]   are in normal range or high or low,
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.840]   but they don't inform you what steps to take
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.460]   as a consequence.
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.220]   In addition, they can often be very confusing
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.600]   what all the factors are and what they really mean.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.280]   Inside Tracker has a dashboard and a platform
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.440]   that makes interpreting all that information really easy.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.080]   It also points you in the direction
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.600]   of certain lifestyle factors, exercise, nutrition, et cetera,
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.680]   that you might want to change in order to bring the numbers
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.840]   into the ranges that you want.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.640]   So Inside Tracker is something that I've been doing
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.680]   for some time now,
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.840]   and it's really helped me inform the choices.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.780]   For instance, I've swapped out some of the foods
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.000]   that I was eating regularly.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.760]   I found out I was actually too high
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.220]   in certain vitamins and minerals.
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.640]   I was too low in others.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.080]   It's really helped me adjust my diet
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.720]   and my exercise regimes,
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.000]   and it really gives me the confidence
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.400]   that I'm on the path to long-term health.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.960]   So if you want to try Inside Tracker,
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.260]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.600]   to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.680]   Use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.320]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.160]   to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.660]   and use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.600]   Our next sponsor is ExpressVPN.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.980]   ExpressVPN is a virtual private network
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.200]   that keeps your data safe and secure and private.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.400]   It does that by routing your internet activity
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.560]   through their servers and encrypting it
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.200]   so that no one can see or sell your data.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.300]   I started using ExpressVPN
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.400]   because my bank account got hacked.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.040]   I still don't know exactly how it happened,
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.120]   but it was an absolute mess.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.000]   I lost money.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.760]   I lost a lot of time.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.000]   I wouldn't want to have it happen to anybody.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.840]   When that happened,
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.640]   I talked to my friends in the tech community
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.360]   and they told me that even though
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.560]   you think your internet connection is secure,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.280]   oftentimes it's not.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.560]   So I tend to use internet connections on planes,
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.840]   in hotels, in cafes, but also at home.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.720]   And I was told that even at home,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.400]   your data may not be as secure as you think.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.700]   And so with ExpressVPN, your data is absolutely secure.
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.600]   So are your online activities.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.340]   The great thing is you don't even notice
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.680]   that it's operating.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.180]   It's running in the background.
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.980]   You just turn it on and it goes without you realizing
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.440]   that your data is being protected.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.340]   It doesn't interfere with any of your online activities.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.080]   So I use ExpressVPN when I travel,
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.240]   anytime I'm outside the house, when I'm at work,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.760]   and when I'm at home.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.040]   If you want to try ExpressVPN,
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.520]   you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.480]   And if you do that, you'll get an extra three months free
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.440]   on one of their one-year packages.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.700]   That's expressvpn.com/huberman
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.200]   to get three months free on a one-year package.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.400]   The final sponsor of today's podcast is Magic Spoon.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.120]   Magic Spoon is a zero sugar,
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.840]   grain-free, keto-friendly cereal.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.940]   As I've mentioned before on the podcast,
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.200]   I'm neither ketogenic, nor am I all meat, nor am I vegan.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.940]   The way I eat is that early in the day I fast.
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.160]   And then sometime around noon, I eat my first meal.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.800]   And that meal is always low carbohydrate.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.760]   And then throughout the day,
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.180]   I maintain a low carbohydrate diet.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.740]   The fasting and low carbohydrate diet during the daytime
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.720]   optimizes alertness and wakefulness.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.800]   I want to be awake and be able to work.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.780]   And then at night is when I eat my carbohydrates
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.140]   'cause it facilitates the transition to sleep.
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.160]   So for me, Magic Spoon is a terrific snack in the afternoon.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.140]   I'll sometimes even have it with lunch.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.140]   And the reason I like it
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.880]   is because it tastes really delicious
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.640]   and it's compatible with the keto-friendly
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.520]   or keto-like meals that I eat throughout the day.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.120]   They come in a variety of flavors,
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.540]   cocoa, fruity, peanut butter, frosted.
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.120]   I particularly like the frosted
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.320]   because it tastes like donuts in my opinion.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.920]   And I love donuts.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.760]   As a consequence, I love Magic Spoon cereal.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.640]   I can consume it.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.000]   It tastes like a pastry.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.400]   And it has zero grams of sugar.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.740]   And it's compatible with this nutritional regimen
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.080]   I mentioned earlier.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.500]   If you want to try Magic Spoon,
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.360]   you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.040]   to grab a variety pack.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.520]   Use the code Huberman at checkout
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.160]   and get $5 off your order.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.640]   That's magicspoon.com/huberman
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.720]   and use the code Huberman to get $5 off.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.740]   This month, we're talking all about the science of emotions
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.600]   and tools related to the science of emotions.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.520]   We've talked about the science of stress and resiliency,
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.600]   tools to access more calm,
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   tools to raise your stress threshold
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.080]   to become more resilient.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.380]   We've talked about motivation
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.560]   and the role of the dopamine system.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.240]   I'd like to make a couple of announcements
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.120]   about some new resources.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.800]   The first one is that we have now captioned
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.760]   all the Huberman Lab episodes in English and in Spanish.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.760]   We were able to do that thanks to your support
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.360]   of our sponsors and on Patreon.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.680]   So now all of the podcasts have a captioning feature
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.120]   on YouTube and those were done by experts.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.600]   So while there might be the occasional error
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.200]   for the most part, they're very precise.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.080]   We've done that so that people that prefer
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.280]   to consume the content in Spanish
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.000]   or that like to read the content
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.320]   from the English subtitles can do so.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.880]   And we're going to continue to expand the number of languages
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.240]   that are captioned for the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.100]   So we want to thank you for that resource.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.860]   It's now available for all episodes.
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.140]   In addition, in previous episodes,
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.340]   I've talked about NSDR or non-sleep deep rest.
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.380]   NSDRs come in a variety of different forms.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.640]   There's self hypnosis.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.480]   I've pointed you to some resources for that previously.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.120]   There's yoga nidra.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.940]   NSDR is really about achieving calm quickly
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.240]   and doing that in a self-directed way for many reasons.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.260]   In order to access sleep more readily,
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.660]   in order to de-stress very deeply,
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.760]   in order to replace sleep that you've lost.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.280]   It also seems to aid neuroplasticity.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.260]   It can enhance the rearrangements of connections
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.020]   in the brain that occur during learning.
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.220]   There's scientific support for that.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.940]   There's a link in today's episode caption to a new site.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.800]   This is a YouTube video that was brought free of cost
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.400]   by the folks over at Made For,
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.260]   a company that's been a sponsor of the podcast previously.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.240]   So this is an NSDR script that doesn't contain
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.460]   any of the intentions
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.020]   or some of the more typical language of yoga nidra.
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.940]   Instead, it's focused purely on the breathing protocols
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.980]   as well as includes a sort of body scan
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.020]   where you direct your attention
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.320]   to different locations around your body.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.500]   It has all the core elements of non-sleep deep rest
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.540]   but is distinct from yoga nidra.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.240]   I just offer this to you as a resource
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.340]   if you'd like to use it.
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.080]   It's about 30 minutes long and should be very effective
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.320]   in bringing you into deep states of relaxation
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.060]   for all the reasons I mentioned before.
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.860]   So let's talk about emotions.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.540]   Emotions are a fascinating and vital aspect
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.380]   of our life experience.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.340]   It's fair to say that emotions make up
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.940]   most of what we think of as our experience of life.
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.260]   Even the things we do, our behaviors and the places we go
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.800]   and the people we end up encountering in our life,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.420]   all of that really funnels into our emotional perception
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.120]   of what those things mean,
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.980]   whether or not they made us happy or sad or depressed
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.640]   or lonely or we're awe-inspiring.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.600]   Now, one thing that is absolutely true
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.780]   is that everyone's perception of emotion
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.320]   is slightly different.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.240]   Meaning your idea of happy is very likely different
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.980]   than my idea of what a state of happiness is.
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.700]   And we know this also for color vision, for instance.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.540]   Even though the cells in your eye and my eye
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.600]   that perceive the color red are identical
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.340]   right down to the genes that they express,
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.420]   we can be certain based on experimental evidence
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.020]   and what are called psychophysical studies
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.500]   that your idea of the most intense red
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.620]   is going to be very different than my idea
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.780]   of the most intense red.
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.020]   If we were given a selection of 10 different reds
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.660]   and asked which one is most intense,
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.940]   which one looks most red.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.460]   And that seems crazy.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.740]   You would think that something as simple as color
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.380]   would be universal and yet it's not.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.720]   And so we need to agree at the outset
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.580]   that emotions are complicated.
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.420]   And yet they are tractable.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.620]   They can be understood.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.440]   And today we're going to talk about a lot of tools
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.860]   to understand what emotions are
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.700]   for you to understand what your emotional states mean
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.220]   and what they don't mean.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.580]   And in doing that, that will allow you to place a value
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.640]   on whether or not you should hold an emotional state
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.740]   as true or not true.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.140]   Whether or not it has meaning or it doesn't.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.000]   As well as whether or not the emotions of others
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.500]   are important to you in a given context.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.340]   We're going to talk a lot about development.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.660]   In fact, we're going to center a lot of our discussion today
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.160]   around infancy and puberty.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.820]   We're also going to talk about tools
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.640]   for enhancing one's emotional range
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.460]   and for navigating difficult emotional situations.
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.020]   I am not a clinical psychologist.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.480]   I'm not a therapist,
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.980]   but I do have some background in psychology.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.060]   And today I'm going to be drawing
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.620]   from the psychology greats.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.080]   Not me, but from the greats of psychology
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.180]   who studied emotion, who studied emotional development
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.000]   and linking that to the neuroscience of emotion.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.680]   Because nowadays we understand a lot about the chemicals
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.620]   and the hormones and the neural circuits
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.220]   in the brain and body that underlie emotion.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.140]   So while there's no one single universally true
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.720]   theory of emotion,
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.620]   at the intersection of many of the existing theories,
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.940]   there are really some ground truths.
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.220]   So today we're going to visit those ground truths.
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.420]   We're going to talk about the tools that emerge from them.
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.580]   And we're going to talk about some absolutely wild
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.440]   and wacky experiments that people are doing
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.480]   out there right now
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.600]   that I don't necessarily recommend you do
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.420]   of inhaling different types of hormones
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.380]   and trying to get attached more quickly.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.620]   You're actually going to do some experiential stuff today
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.460]   if you like.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.680]   There's some things that you can do in real time
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.480]   while listening to the podcast
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.120]   in order to tap into some of the mechanisms
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.140]   that I'll be referring to.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.740]   So today's going to be very interactive
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.700]   in a way that previous podcasts episodes have not.
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.960]   If we want to understand emotions,
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.680]   we have to look at where emotions first develop.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.140]   In fact, this is a critical central theme
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.480]   if you want to understand brain science and psychology.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.240]   There's a rule in neuroanatomy.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.160]   Because if you look at 50 different brains of humans
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.080]   or you compare the brains of dogs and humans,
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.500]   there are a lot of differences.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.400]   Certain things are the same,
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.820]   but certain things are different.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.800]   And the rule that every good neuroanatomist knows
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.400]   is that if you want to understand
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.420]   what a part of the brain does,
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.860]   you have to address two questions.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.280]   First, you have to know what connections
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.380]   does that brain area make?
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.600]   What is it connected to?
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.440]   Where does it get inputs from?
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.600]   And where does it send inputs?
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.800]   So for instance, if there's an area of the brain
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.720]   that gets direct input from the neurons in the nose,
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.580]   you can be pretty certain that it has some role
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.500]   in analyzing smell, in measuring something about odors
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.500]   or analyzing something about odors.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.760]   Now, if it also gets input from the eye,
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.680]   you can also conclude that it gets input
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.900]   from the visual system,
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.040]   that it cares about light and photons.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.360]   This is sort of obvious.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.520]   And yet you need to know that connectivity
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.280]   and you need to know what's called
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.600]   the developmental origin of that structure.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.680]   You need to know where it was early in development
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.600]   because things move around a lot as the brain develops.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.680]   The brain of course is this more or less squishy thing
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.960]   floating around in some liquid
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.760]   that's stuffed inside your skull.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.080]   And as a consequence, things move around a lot.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.640]   They are not always in the same place
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.040]   in two different species
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.680]   or two individuals of the same species.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.480]   So you have to know where they started out
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.760]   because where they started out
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.920]   informs what they do as well.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.520]   And when we're talking about emotions,
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.020]   we cannot point to one area of the brain.
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.020]   We can't say that's the area of the brain
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.980]   that's responsible for emotions.
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.360]   There is this so-called limbic system
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.600]   that has been linked to emotions in various ways.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.520]   We're going to talk about that today.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.300]   But the limbic system is just one component
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.400]   of the inputs to create emotions.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.040]   It's not the place for emotions.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.000]   You can't go in and lesion one location in the brain
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.080]   and eliminate emotions entirely.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.380]   It just doesn't work that way.
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.400]   So first of all, we have to ask,
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.160]   what are the circuits for emotion?
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.760]   What are the brain areas for emotion?
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.040]   And nowadays there's a lot of debate about this.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.280]   For years, it was thought that there might be circuits,
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.520]   meaning connections in the brain
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.240]   that generate the feeling of being happy
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.400]   or circuits that generate the feeling of being sad, et cetera.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.320]   That's been challenged.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.480]   In fact, Lisa Feldman Barrett has been the person
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.360]   who's really challenged this head on
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.080]   and has very good evidence for the fact
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.740]   that such circuits probably don't exist.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.840]   And yet I think there's good evidence
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.320]   for circuits in the brain,
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.960]   such as limbic circuits and other circuits
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.740]   that shift our overall states
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.320]   or our overall level of alertness or calmness,
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.920]   or whether or not they bias us
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.700]   toward viewing the outside world
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.760]   or paying more attention to what's going on
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.460]   inside our bodies.
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.800]   If none of this makes sense right now,
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.680]   I promise it will make sense soon.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.980]   But the important thing to understand
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:59.360]   is that emotions do arise in the brain and body.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.500]   They arise because there are specific connections
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.200]   between specific areas in the brain and body.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.640]   And if we want to understand how emotions work,
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.680]   we have to look how emotions are built.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:15.680]   And they are built during infancy, adolescence, and puberty.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.480]   And then it continues into adulthood,
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.400]   but the groundwork is laid down early in development
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.300]   when we are small children.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.600]   So let's think about what happens
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.040]   to a baby that comes into the world.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.400]   A baby comes into the world,
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.060]   you were born into this world
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.320]   without really any understanding of the things around you.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.040]   Now, there are two ways that you can interact
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.800]   with the world and you're always doing them more or less
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.040]   to some degree at the same time.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.760]   Those are interoception,
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.320]   paying attention to what's going on inside you,
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.680]   what you feel internally,
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.580]   and exteroception, paying attention
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.400]   to what's going on outside you.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.720]   Hold that in mind, please,
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.840]   because the fact that you're both interocepting
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.900]   and exterocepting is true for your entire life
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.200]   and it sets the foundation for understanding emotions.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.580]   It's absolutely critical.
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:08.120]   As an infant, you didn't have any knowledge
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.240]   of what you needed.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.720]   You didn't understand hunger,
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.140]   you didn't understand toys
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.240]   when you first came into the world,
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.540]   you didn't understand cold or heat or any of that.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.260]   When you needed something,
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.160]   you experienced that as anxiety.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.120]   You would feel an increase in alertness
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.400]   if you had to use the bathroom,
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.680]   you would feel an increase in alertness if you were hungry,
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.480]   and you would vocalize, you would cry out,
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.300]   you would act agitated, you might coo,
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.860]   you might do a number of different things,
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.840]   but all you knew was what you were feeling internally,
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.420]   and then your caregiver, whoever that might've been,
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.560]   would respond to that.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.280]   So you would feel some agitation,
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.220]   a caregiver would come and make a decision.
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:52.040]   Oh, you need food and give you milk or change your diaper
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.980]   or wrap you in a blanket if you were cold,
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.580]   but they didn't know if you were cold,
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.660]   they could just assume that you were cold.
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.740]   So this is actually really important to understand
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.000]   that a baby, when you were a baby and when I was a baby,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.560]   we didn't have any sense of the outside world
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.560]   except that it responded to our acts of anxiety essentially.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.000]   Now, this isn't Freudian theory, right?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   There are components of it
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.480]   that are embedded in Freudian theory,
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.080]   but all developmental psychologists agree
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.120]   that babies lack the ability
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.740]   to make cognitive sense of the outside world.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.200]   But in this feeling of anxiety
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.300]   and registering one's own internal state
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.340]   and then crying out to the outside world,
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.760]   either through crying or subtle vocalizations,
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.240]   or even just cooing, making some noise,
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.320]   we start to develop a relationship with the outside world
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.920]   in which our internal states, our shifts in anxiety,
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.020]   start to drive requests
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.840]   and people come and respond to those requests, hopefully.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.680]   And the reason I say hopefully
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.860]   is that we've all heard presumably
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.720]   about these cases of neglect.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.320]   There are a lot of cases where if you neglect a baby,
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.880]   you neglect an adolescent or a teenager,
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.600]   development doesn't go well.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.940]   And we'll touch on some of those,
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.520]   but those are really extreme cases.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.120]   They're sort of like the parallel to experiments
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.320]   that are often done in the laboratory with animals
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.400]   where you've probably heard of these enriched environments
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.600]   where they'll give mice a bunch of toys
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.240]   and they'll give them some different foods
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.080]   every once in a while
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.780]   and they'll house them together with other mice.
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.060]   And then what you find is that the animals,
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.320]   they will say, oh, their brain is thicker
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.440]   and their neurons have more branches to them and all that.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.540]   But that's really comparing deprivation with normalcy.
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.040]   What we want to center on today instead
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.060]   is what happens when things go well
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.920]   and why things might not go well in certain circumstances
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.980]   is interesting, but to me, not as interesting
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.200]   as what healthy emotional development looks like.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.420]   And if you haven't achieved healthy emotional development,
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.600]   what can be done as an intervention at later times
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.280]   in order to rescue that?
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.280]   So the baby, you as a baby,
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.740]   you're flopping around there in your crib,
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.000]   you're getting care where you need it
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.120]   and when you need it, presumably.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   And this gets to the basis of what emotions are about,
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.260]   which emotions are really about forming bonds
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.260]   and being able to predict things in the world.
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.620]   That's really what emotions are about.
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.140]   Whether or not the baby feels angry or happy or sad,
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.200]   we don't know.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.560]   We can guess, but we don't know.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.660]   In fact, most of the time, we don't even know how we feel,
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.000]   let alone how other people feel.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.480]   And that's true for adults.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.200]   So if I ask you how you feel right now,
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.600]   I don't know that you could tell me
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.420]   in any kind of rich language that I would say,
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.120]   oh, I really understand.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.020]   If you said you were very, very depressed
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.000]   or very, very happy,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.680]   I'd have some sense because of how extreme that is,
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.160]   but I don't know that I would really know.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.200]   And I don't think you know how I feel right now either.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.820]   I could be furious right now or I could be very happy.
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.160]   You don't have any idea.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.520]   Now, of course, we have these things called expressions.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.520]   Our pupils dilate.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.640]   There are various cues of how people feel.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.040]   We're going to talk about those cues,
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.440]   but you really don't know.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.600]   And at this point, I actually just want to pause
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.600]   and mention a really interesting tool
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.640]   that is trying to address this question
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.320]   of what are emotions and what do they consist of
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.860]   that you can use if you like.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:07.700]   This is an app.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.520]   I didn't develop it.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.080]   I don't have any relationship to them,
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.880]   but the app was developed by people at Yale,
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.960]   by groups at Yale who do research and it's called Mood Meter.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.440]   And it's actually quite interesting.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.280]   I think it's either free or it's 99 cents.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.160]   Again, no business relationship to them,
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.120]   but what they're trying to do is put more nuance,
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.960]   more subtlety on our words and our language for emotions
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.400]   and be able to allow you to predict
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.120]   how you're going to feel in the future.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.520]   And it's actually quite interesting.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.560]   I'm on the app right now, and I know you can't see this,
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.900]   but it's called Mood Meter.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.620]   And you can find it on Apple or Android.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.640]   And you go into it and it asks you,
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.340]   it says to me, "Hi, Andrew, how are you right now?"
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.360]   And I click the little tab that says, I feel,
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.520]   and I can either pick high energy and unpleasant,
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.720]   high energy and pleasant,
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.840]   low energy, unpleasant, or low energy, pleasant.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.760]   And I would say right now, I feel high energy, pleasant.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.320]   So I just revealed to you how I feel.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.500]   So I click on that and then it gives you a gallery of colors
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.920]   and you just move your finger to the location
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.820]   where you think it matches most.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.960]   And as you do that, little words pop up.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.560]   I know some people are looking at this on,
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.920]   or listening to this on audio only.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.960]   So say motivated, cheerful, inspired.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.040]   I would say, I'm feeling right now, cheerful.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.760]   So you click that and then you just go to the next window
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.920]   and it just says, what are you doing?
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.880]   And this feels like play to me,
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.120]   but I'm going to call it work.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.480]   And then that's it.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.720]   And then what it does is it basically starts
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.280]   to collect data on you.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.720]   You're giving it information and it starts to link that
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.680]   to other features that you allow it access to if you like.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.080]   And it starts helping you be able to protect
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.280]   how you're going to feel at different times of day.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.820]   It's actually quite accurate in certain ways,
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.060]   quite interesting.
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.600]   And it points to a couple of really interesting features,
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.240]   which is that we don't really have enough language
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.680]   to describe all the emotional states.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:05.040]   And yet there's some core truths to what makes up an emotion.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.780]   And I want to review that twice during today's podcast,
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.500]   because this can really help people, kids and adults,
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.040]   understand better what they're feeling and why,
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.920]   and when best to engage in certain activities.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.340]   And thankfully when best to avoid certain activities too.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.340]   So the way this works is the following.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.340]   You need to ask yourself at any point,
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.840]   you could do this right now if you like,
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.360]   what's your level of autonomic arousal?
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.180]   Autonomic arousal is just the continuum,
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.840]   the range of alert to calm.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.840]   So if you're in a panic right now,
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.260]   you are like 10 out of 10 on the arousal scale.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.780]   If you're asleep,
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.760]   you're probably not comprehending what I'm saying,
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.020]   although maybe a little bit,
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.480]   but let's say you're very drowsy.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.060]   You might be at a one or a two.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.160]   So you always have to ask,
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.400]   where are you on the arousal scale?
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.400]   And then there's this other axis, this other question,
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.260]   which is what we call valence.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.740]   Now, valence is a value.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.320]   Do you feel good or bad?
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.620]   I would say I feel pretty good right now
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.920]   on a scale of one to 10.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.360]   I'm like, I don't know, I feel like a seven.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.680]   Got a good night's sleep last night.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.720]   Had a good walk with Costello this morning,
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.800]   I'm fed, I'm hydrated, I feel good.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.880]   So I'm like a seven.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.280]   So I'm alert and I feel pretty good.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.480]   And then there's a third thing,
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.040]   which is how much we are interocepting
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.520]   and how much we are exterocepting, all right?
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.860]   So how much our attention is focused internally
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.520]   on what we're feeling and how much it's focused externally.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.820]   And this is always going to be in a dynamic balance.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.000]   So for instance, if you're really, really stressed,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.040]   oftentimes that puts you in a position
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.240]   to be really in touch with what's going on in your body.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.060]   If you start having a lot of somatic,
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.440]   a lot of bodily sensations,
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.500]   like your heart is beating so fast that you can't ignore it,
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.440]   then you're really strongly interoceptive.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.000]   But also sometimes you're really stressed
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.280]   because someone's stressing you out
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.820]   or somebody sends you a text message
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.000]   or makes a comment about a YouTube thing you posted
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.020]   or something and you're really triggered by it.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.000]   That never happens to me,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.360]   but if it does happen to you, then you're exterocepting.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.400]   So there are these three things,
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.180]   how alert or sleepy you are, that's one.
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.520]   How good or bad you feel, that's two.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.240]   And then whether or not most of your attention
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.680]   is directed outward or whether or not it's directed inward.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.720]   And much of what we call emotions
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.280]   are made up by those three things.
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.120]   And so let's return now to development,
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.120]   but tuck that away and just kind of think about it,
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.040]   alert versus asleep, good versus bad,
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.380]   and focused internally or focused externally.
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.800]   Because when I looked at the whole of all the theories
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.040]   of emotion that were out there,
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.140]   there were a lot of different components to them,
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.360]   but they all seem to center back
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.280]   to these same three features in some way
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.520]   or to some degree or another.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.600]   And it can be very powerful to understand
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.020]   and look at your emotions through that lens.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.600]   So let's return to the infant.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.500]   There's the baby in the crib.
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.760]   It's mostly interocepting.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.240]   As caregivers bring it what it needs, you hope,
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.040]   milk, diaper changes, et cetera,
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.160]   a warm blanket if it's cold,
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.240]   pull off the blanket when the baby's fussing
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.240]   and it's too warm 'cause babies get too warm also.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.640]   It starts to exterocept, excuse me, I misspoke.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.480]   I want to be very clear.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.760]   It starts to exterocept.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.340]   The baby starts to look into the outside world
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.380]   and start making predictions.
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.240]   It starts wondering how much it needs to cry
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.160]   or predicting, well, if I cry like a little bit,
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.960]   then mom comes over and I get my milk.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.160]   Or if I cry a lot, mom doesn't come over and give me milk.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.360]   So I need to really scream at the top of my head, okay?
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.460]   So babies are starting to evaluate and do all this,
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.140]   but they're not doing it consciously.
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.320]   They're doing this strategically
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.440]   in order to relieve anxiety.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.280]   And I won't propose that that's what we do into adulthood.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.520]   But a lot of what we do in adulthood
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.960]   is when we feel something, we start exterocepting.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.160]   Some people are much better at just sitting as a container
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.240]   and just interocepting and paying attention
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.840]   to what they're feeling internally.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.640]   But most people do a little bit of a balance of both.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.220]   We don't feel good, so we look for an item of food
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.360]   that might make us feel better.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.040]   We're feeling anxious, heading into the dentist
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.660]   or something like that, so we text somebody.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.420]   We do this almost reflexively.
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.320]   It's not always conscious.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.880]   So infants do this and we continue to do this.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.360]   We start to now balance our interoceptive
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.800]   and exteroceptive focus,
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.120]   our looking inward and looking outward.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.300]   And as we do that, we're starting to figure out
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.740]   what gets our needs met.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.480]   Remember, emotions are really there to form bonds
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.840]   and to make predictions.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.840]   And so our needs are going to be met to some degree or not.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.920]   Sometimes, sadly, there is neglect.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.440]   Sometimes people don't show up for us
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.780]   the way that we would like.
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:03.200]   And in general, our responses to that
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.060]   have to do with whether or not we predict
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.120]   whether or not they would or not.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.400]   When we expect something and it doesn't happen,
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.360]   it's a big letdown.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.920]   That was the discussion about dopamine last episode.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.580]   So the many theories of emotion, the triune brain theory
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.440]   that you have a primitive and evolved brain,
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.860]   something that's a little bit on shaky ground these days,
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.340]   the idea that Darwin proposed
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.080]   that there are these universal expressions of emotions,
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.780]   the work of Helen Fisher on love
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.180]   that you have circuits in the brain for lust,
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.900]   circuits in the brain for love
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.160]   and circuits in the brain for long-term bonds,
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.260]   as well as the work of Lisa Feldman Barrett
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.380]   saying that emotions are contextual,
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.380]   that they have a social component.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.760]   And I'll be talking more about this,
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.340]   but the work of Alan Shore,
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:49.380]   a clinical psychologist and researcher at UCLA
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.780]   about right brain, left brain
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.380]   and its role in emotional development.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.820]   All of them have strong elements of this idea
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.680]   of paying attention to what's going on inward and outward.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.020]   As a young creature, an infant and young toddler,
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.600]   you were mainly focused inward
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.000]   and you started to understand what was going on outward
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.460]   as a way of predicting what would bring you relief,
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.160]   what would remove your anxiety.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.280]   And that's where the fundamental rules of your experience,
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.540]   your emotional experience were laid down.
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.080]   Now I realize that's a lot of information
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.380]   and it's somewhat of an academic talk,
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.060]   but there were two tools in there
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.060]   that I just want to highlight.
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.360]   One is the Mood Meter app.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.460]   If you're interested in it can give you some insight
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.820]   into the different kinds of nuance within emotions
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.880]   and allow you to actually predict emotional states.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.060]   If you want to try that and you might find that interesting.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.300]   The other one is this idea
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.620]   that there are three axes to emotion,
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.980]   three continuum that interact,
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.140]   the level of alertness and calmness,
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.540]   how good or bad you feel
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.700]   and whether or not you're mainly focused inward or outward
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.820]   because those are going to form a useful toolkit
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.740]   for the information going forward.
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.500]   So now let's talk about what kind of baby you were
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.620]   because that actually informs your emotionality now.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.460]   These are classic, they're actually famous experiments
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.260]   done by Bowlby and Ainsworth.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.600]   Anyone that studied psychology
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.860]   or has taken a psychology class
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.260]   might've learned about this.
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.520]   This is this classic experiment
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.520]   of what was called the strange situation task in which,
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.880]   and I'm describing it very coarsely here, I realize,
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.580]   but a mother and child come into the laboratory.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.880]   Yes, this has now also been done with fathers.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:36.160]   The baby and the mother or father play together for a bit
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.600]   and then the mother leaves.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.640]   The mother leaves for some period of time
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.580]   and then comes back.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.680]   And the research is devoted
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.720]   to understanding the response of the child
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.100]   when the caretaker, the mother or the father returns.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.640]   Most all children, not every child,
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.520]   but most children will cry
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.300]   when their primary caretaker leaves.
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.020]   They don't like that.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.700]   And there are good reasons for that.
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.440]   They formed a bond and an attachment.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.280]   And we will talk about
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.660]   some of the deeper chemical reasons for those bonds.
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.880]   However, the experiment is focused
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.160]   on the return of the caregiver
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.540]   because Bowlby and Ainsworth
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.000]   and many of their scientific offspring and colleagues
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.160]   identified at least four patterns
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.420]   that babies display when their caretaker returns.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.800]   And they group these into group A, B, C, D,
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.680]   so much so that the kids were referred to as A babies,
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.160]   B babies, C babies, or D babies.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.120]   You may know which one you were,
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.000]   but the categories are really interesting.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.480]   The first babies are the A babies.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.100]   So these were kids that would get upset
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.720]   when their caretaker would leave,
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.000]   but when their caretaker would return,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.280]   the infant would respond with happiness,
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.640]   with what looked like delight.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.880]   They would go to the caretaker.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.100]   They seemed happy if they had been fussy before or sad,
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.440]   they felt relieved.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.380]   These are referred to as secure attached kids.
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.100]   So they have a healthy response to separation
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.760]   and they have a healthy response
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.760]   to re-engaging with the caretaker.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.260]   The B babies, as they're called,
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:21.740]   were less likely to seek comfort from their caregiver
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.600]   when the caregiver would return.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.280]   So they would sometimes continue to play with their toys
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.360]   or they would be with the,
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.600]   they had an adult in the room while the parent was gone,
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.920]   they would stay with them.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.640]   It was sometimes complicated and nuanced,
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.480]   but these were referred to as avoidant babies.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.160]   Don't run away with any conclusions
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.800]   about the language here just yet.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:46.160]   It's not clear that avoidant babies become avoidant adults,
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.460]   but bear with me.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:52.460]   The C babies would respond to the return of the caregiver
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.880]   with acts of annoyance.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.920]   They seemed kind of angry, right?
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.600]   So it wasn't that they ignored them,
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.300]   they seemed kind of angry.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.860]   And those were referred to as ambivalent babies.
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.240]   Not to be confused with A babies,
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.200]   these are the C babies were the ambivalent babies.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.600]   So the infant's reaction to the returning caregiver
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.920]   were inconsistent.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.280]   It seemed like they wanted to bond with them again,
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.800]   but that they seemed kind of annoyed.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.620]   I think we've all felt this way before
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.080]   with people that we care very much about,
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.400]   especially people we care very much about.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.400]   And then the third category, the D babies
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.120]   were the disorganized babies.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:27.960]   That's what they call them.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.000]   They weren't disorganized in that they were messy.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.360]   The child avoided interactions with everyone
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.140]   and acted fearful when the caregiver returned.
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.160]   And their behavior didn't really change
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.040]   whether or not the caregiver was there or not.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.720]   And that fourth category was actually added rather late
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.640]   in the course of this research.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.760]   I should mention these experiments have been repeated
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.180]   with a huge variety of different contexts.
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.740]   There was work done by Mary Main at UC Berkeley
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.780]   and many others looking at all sorts of variations
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.860]   on this theme.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:03.260]   But over time, it made it clear that certain babies
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:07.680]   are able to feel secure upon re-engaging
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.080]   with their caregiver and others don't,
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.980]   or they're confused about it.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.580]   So we probably don't know whether or not
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.900]   you were an A, a B or a C, D baby,
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.220]   unless you were in these experiments
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.020]   and somehow you had that knowledge.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:25.980]   But this work, this classic work opened up a huge set
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.560]   of important questions that relate to
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.540]   what is the re-establishment of the bond really about?
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.180]   I mean, what's actually being figured out here
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.460]   is not whether or not there are four categories of babies.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.540]   That's interesting.
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.980]   But it presumably is more interesting to focus on
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.100]   what is it that defines a really good bond,
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.700]   a secure attachment or an insecure attachment
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.780]   or an avoidant attachment.
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:54.780]   And the four things are gaze, literally eye contact,
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:58.900]   and doesn't have to be direct beaming eye contact
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.900]   with no blinks like people accused me of before.
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.120]   It can just be gaze that people look at each other.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.500]   You see couples, they look at each other.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.460]   They don't always stare at each other long periods of time.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.420]   Sometimes they do.
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:13.260]   Vocalizations, so what we say and how we say it.
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:17.620]   Affect or emotion, so the way that we express crying,
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.960]   smiling, et cetera, and touch, those four things.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.500]   And you probably could add a fifth dimension
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.280]   once language and written language develops,
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.740]   which is written word, exchange of letters,
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.980]   exchange of texts, exchange of things of that sort,
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.360]   emails are another way in which people can bond.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.900]   But gaze, vocalization, affect and touch
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.540]   are really the core of this thing
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.340]   that we call social bonds and emotionality.
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.140]   Now that's important.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.500]   We know, for instance, that there are brain areas
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.760]   like the fusiform face area, which is deep in the brain,
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.940]   that is responsible for the processing of faces.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:58.020]   Children's recognition of their parents' faces and voices
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.120]   is extremely accurate and strong.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.700]   Likewise, parents' recognition of their child's vocalizations
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.780]   not just voices, but cries are remarkable.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.160]   If you've ever had the experience of being at a party
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.460]   with somebody who has small children
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.060]   and you're talking to them and all of a sudden
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.720]   they hear something but you don't,
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.020]   it's as if they've got wolf hearing
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.660]   and all of a sudden they go running into the other room
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.340]   and indeed, the kid is like, I don't know,
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.840]   some kid is beating up their kid
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.540]   or their kid's beating up some other kid
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.700]   or the kid has done injured themselves
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.220]   or feels emotionally injured.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.940]   This perception of voices,
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.300]   there's very good evidence to support the fact
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.740]   that we are tuned to the frequencies of voices
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.740]   and vocalizations of people that we care about.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.620]   It's not just true in rodents and in birds and other mammals,
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.320]   it's definitely true in humans as well.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.140]   And babies are very tuned in to the sound
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:46.980]   of their mother's voice.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.500]   Even yes, while they're in the womb,
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.940]   there's this whole world of what's called mother ease
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.820]   which is the particular style of speech that mothers
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:00.220]   and other caretakers now we know use with children.
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.860]   So those are the core elements, right?
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.340]   How you look at somebody and how they look at you,
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.620]   what you say, what they say, what they seem to be feeling
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.180]   and how that makes you feel, smiles, frowns.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.580]   If you know someone really well,
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.660]   you can read inflections in like even little subtle things
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:18.420]   like they don't really believe me
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.640]   or they're really excited by this
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.280]   or now I know what they're thinking.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.380]   That kind of processing,
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.540]   some people are better at it than others
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.960]   but everyone's better at doing that
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.820]   with people that we recognize and know.
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:36.240]   In fact, couples come to know each other exceedingly well,
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.660]   so much so that it can both benefit
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.400]   and injure their relationship
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.720]   to constantly be making these perceptions.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.560]   But there's a range,
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:46.000]   some people are more tuned into this than others.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.520]   And that probably has roots in the sorts of attachments
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.780]   that you form early on.
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:55.580]   So Boulby and colleagues developed these ABCD thing
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.720]   and it has a lot to do with face processing
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.560]   and gaze and vocalizations and touch.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.780]   All of those happened on return with the mother
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:03.960]   but they weren't parsing those,
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.920]   they weren't looking at them individually.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.360]   So this raises a really interesting question
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.680]   which is what is it when we feel something?
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:17.340]   Is it because of something that happens spontaneously in us,
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.620]   it's a memory or it's something that we realize
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.620]   we saw on the internet or we got news about somebody.
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.260]   Nowadays, people get so much information
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.460]   about the people they know,
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:26.940]   both the people they like and dislike
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:30.420]   by way of viewing online activities, right?
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.740]   So they're extra accepting
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.980]   and then it's impacting your internal state.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.760]   And it's clear from most all of the theories
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:41.460]   of emotional health that an ability to recognize
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.860]   when your own internal state is being driven primarily
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:48.220]   by external events as important
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:51.220]   for being able to emotionally regulate, right?
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.340]   People who are constantly being yanked around
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.500]   by the external happenings in the world,
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.700]   you would say are emotionally labile.
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.900]   They are not in control of their emotions.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.880]   Even if they're calm all the time,
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.420]   if that calmness only arrives
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.100]   because they're in a placid environment
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.400]   and then you put a cracker in that environment
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.720]   and they freak out, well, then they're not really calm.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.900]   They're calm in so far
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.260]   as there isn't something disturbing in the environment.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.200]   So how much the outside environment
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.200]   disrupts your internal environment
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.500]   has everything to do with this balance
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.280]   of interoception and exteroception.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.740]   And it very likely has roots in whether or not
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.800]   you were secure attached or insecure attached,
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.160]   disorganized or ambivalent as a baby.
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.300]   Of course, you can't travel back in time and know,
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.300]   but there are some hints as to what kind of emotionality
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:41.580]   each of us has by examining two periods of development.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:45.620]   One is adolescence and puberty, and the other is adulthood.
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.940]   So while we can't travel back in time,
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.460]   there is an exercise that you can do
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.140]   to address at least in this moment,
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.060]   whether or not you have a bias for exteroception
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.240]   or a bias for interoception.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.600]   Whether or not you are better, at least in this moment,
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.260]   at paying attention to what's going on internally
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.100]   or externally.
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.780]   And of course, this will vary with circumstance.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.300]   I think we all know people that maybe it's you,
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.300]   you go to a party and you get there
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.680]   and everyone seems to be talking
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.120]   and having a really good time.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.700]   And you're wondering whether or not
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.340]   you have any food in your teeth
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.820]   or whether or not there's something on your face
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.700]   or whether or not your hair is right,
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.580]   or whether or not you said something the wrong way,
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.380]   whether or not you're turning red.
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.860]   People also experienced this a lot with public speaking.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:33.940]   It's not just about learning to clamp your level of stress.
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.980]   It's also about how much you're exterocepting,
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.200]   how much you're out of your head, they call it,
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.140]   but how much you're focused on the events around you
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.880]   versus the events inside you.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.200]   Actually, it's interesting when you talk to people
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.680]   who are very effective athletes
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.320]   or they have very high stress, high consequence jobs,
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.160]   they talk about this notion of getting out of your head.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.540]   You only have so much attentional resource
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.900]   and it can be split between two things.
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.180]   You'll see that in a moment.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.900]   They can be anchored to one thing.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.100]   It can be fully focused on what's going on internally,
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.220]   or it can be fully focused on what's going on externally.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.500]   And if you want to be effective in the world,
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.340]   effective being in quotes,
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:16.640]   it is useful when in very dynamic environments,
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.180]   especially social environments,
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:21.040]   to have a lot of your attention focused outward
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.500]   as opposed to trying to pay attention
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.020]   to whether or not you're saying things correctly
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.340]   or the timbre of your own voice.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.740]   That is more or less destructive
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.980]   for the ability to engage socially.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.180]   So here's the exercise.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.260]   You can do this, please don't do this if you're driving,
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.260]   but let's just try and illustrate
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.320]   or allow you to experience
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.740]   this interoceptive, exteroceptive balance
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:49.180]   and the extent to which you can move interoception
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.000]   and exteroception deliberately.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.380]   If you close your eyes right now
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:59.740]   and concentrate on the contact of any portion of your body
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.800]   with say the chair or your car seat,
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.600]   although please again, don't do this while you're driving,
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.440]   anywhere that you are,
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.680]   even if you're just standing up or you're in the kitchen,
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.800]   you're lying on the couch
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.120]   and trying to bring as much of your attention
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.860]   to that point of contact as possible.
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.020]   And then from there,
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.060]   you're going to move your attention even more deeply
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:22.360]   into say the sensation of what's going on in your gut.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.200]   Are you full?
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.020]   Are you empty?
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:24.860]   Are you hungry?
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:25.960]   Are you not?
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.000]   Is your heart beating?
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:27.840]   At what rate?
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.220]   What's the cadence of your breathing?
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.920]   Basically bringing your focus and attention
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.800]   to everything at the surface of your skin and inward.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.600]   So I'm going to do a rare thing
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.700]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.460]   I'm going to introduce about five to eight seconds
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.540]   of silence in order to allow you to do that a little bit.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:55.460]   Okay.
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.820]   Now, this is an exercise that you can continue afterward
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.000]   if you want to extend how long you do this.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.900]   But now try and do something that for most people
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.220]   actually is a little bit harder,
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:07.180]   which is to purely extero set.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:11.660]   Put your eyes or your ears or both
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.040]   on anything in your immediate space.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:14.880]   One thing.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.920]   And I would restrict that thing to something small enough
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.660]   that at least in your field of view,
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:24.040]   it would occupy 20% of your field of view.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.480]   So it doesn't have to be a pinpoint
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.080]   unless the pin is right in front of you
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.560]   and you're holding it real close.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.980]   I would say, look across the room,
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:34.600]   pick a panel on the wall or a leg of a table or something
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.000]   and try and bring as much of your attention
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.320]   to that as possible.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.220]   And again, I'll take about five seconds of silence
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.400]   to allow you to extero sept.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:53.800]   Okay, so what you probably found
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.880]   is that you were able to do that,
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:58.600]   but that some degree of interoception is maintained.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.900]   It's hard to place 100% of your attention
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.360]   on something externally,
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.440]   unless it's really exciting, really novel.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.820]   If you've ever watched a really great movie,
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.400]   presumably you're extero septing
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.640]   more than you're intero septing
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.040]   until something exciting happens
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.200]   and then you feel something.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.800]   You're actually tethering your emotional experience
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.240]   to something external.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:22.120]   And now you can also do this dynamically.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.880]   You can decide to focus internally and then externally.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:29.040]   You can decide to split it 50%, 50% or 70, 30.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.760]   One can develop, you can develop
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.160]   a heightened ability to do this.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.240]   And the power of doing that
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.360]   is actually that when you are in environments
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.080]   where you feel like you're focused too much internally
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.680]   and you'd like to be focused more externally,
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.200]   you can actually do that deliberately.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   But as you've noticed, it takes work.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.800]   It involves taking your attentional spotlight.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.360]   And what we call the aperture of your attention
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:57.820]   and narrowing that aperture to either the self
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:01.040]   or something externally or splitting the two.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.880]   And yet there are practices that have been developed
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:09.660]   that center on moving interoception and exteroception
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:13.440]   from one being more heavily weighted than the other,
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.000]   more focused outward or more focused inward.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.240]   And it's dynamic.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.440]   And the circuits in the brain
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.060]   that underlie intero and exteroception
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.120]   aren't exactly known,
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.400]   but they are anchored in the areas of the brain
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.420]   they're involved in attention,
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.640]   like the frontal eye fields
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.800]   and areas that when you third person yourself,
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.640]   when you can see yourself doing something,
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.480]   like if you put your hand out in your environment
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.020]   and you focus on your hand,
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.340]   you know that that's your hand
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.700]   as opposed to some random object.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:38.800]   There are areas of the brain
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.980]   they're involved in that in recognizing location of self
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.680]   relative to the rest of your body.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:50.520]   These exercises are really what are at the core
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.780]   of these development of emotional bonds,
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.500]   because as we mentioned before,
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:59.500]   these four things, the gaze, vocalization, touch and affect,
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.140]   those are happening very dynamically.
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.560]   So if somebody winks at you,
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.920]   you're paying attention to their wink,
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.280]   but then you also notice how you feel,
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.000]   then they might say something, then you might say something.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.260]   This is very dynamic.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.000]   So if it seems overwhelming to try and interocept
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   and exterocept and then shift the balance,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.120]   you do that all the time.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.120]   Your brain and nervous system are fantastic at doing this.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.780]   Now, some people have a very hard time
[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:25.560]   breaking out of a very strongly interoceptive mode.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.240]   Some people have a harder time
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:30.280]   breaking out of their exteroceptive mode.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.320]   It's very interesting to note
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.080]   the extent to which we have biases
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.880]   in how interoceptive or exteroceptive we are.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.580]   Remember those three axes that we talked about earlier,
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.440]   you have valence, good or bad,
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.860]   you have alertness, alert or calm,
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:49.320]   and you have interoceptive or exteroceptive bias, right?
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.920]   And it's going to differ across the day,
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.860]   it's going to differ across the lifetime,
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.120]   it's certainly going to differ
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.500]   according to whatever it is that you're engaged in.
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.560]   But early in development,
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.380]   you start off with this interoceptive bias,
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.100]   you are starting to develop expectations,
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.520]   predictions about how the outside world is going to work,
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.900]   and you are trying to figure out
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:14.080]   the reliability of outside events in people
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.800]   and where things are reliable.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.060]   When people are reliable,
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:22.160]   we are able to give up more of our interoception.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.840]   There's literally trust that our interoceptive needs,
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.560]   our internal needs will be met
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.280]   through bonds and actions of others.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.440]   This starts to veer toward
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.500]   the discussion about neglect and trauma.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.580]   We are going to devote entire episodes,
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.880]   probably an entire month, to trauma and PTSD,
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.800]   but those have roots in what we're talking about now,
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.760]   and it's important to internalize and understand
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.680]   what we're talking about now
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.760]   in order to get the most out of those future conversations.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:53.140]   So if all of this seems like a lot of information
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.800]   and very complicated,
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.360]   I just invite you to pay attention from time to time
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.640]   how much you happen to be interocepting or exterocepting,
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:04.600]   because emotions and the intensity of those emotions
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.120]   will grow or shrink
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.880]   depending on how much we're interocepting.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.780]   If we are feeling extremely sad
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:15.580]   and there is an outside event that made us sad,
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.860]   chances are there's going to be a balance,
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.980]   but that the extreme grief, the extreme sadness
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.080]   is going to lead us to mostly interocept.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.180]   Whereas when we're feeling extremely happy,
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.700]   the same is true.
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.540]   Something great happens in the world
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.680]   and we're just going to feel it.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.900]   Most of our perception, most of our awareness
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.780]   is going to be on an internal state.
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:38.460]   So we are always tethered to the outside world
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.300]   to some degree or another.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.120]   That was true when you were an infant
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.100]   and it was true when you were an adolescent
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.660]   and it's true as an adult.
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.560]   So now I want to just pause,
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.980]   just shelve the discussion
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.220]   about interoception, exteroception for a moment.
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:57.020]   And I want to talk about what is arguably the second most,
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:02.020]   if not equally important aspect of your development
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:04.460]   as it relates to emotionality.
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:06.980]   And as it relates to this, what I call trust,
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.600]   but this ability to predict
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.420]   whether or not things in the outside world are reliable
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:14.660]   or not reliable in terms of their ability
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:17.140]   to help you meet your interoceptive needs.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.840]   And that period is puberty.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.400]   So up until now, we've been talking mainly about psychology,
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.480]   not a lot of biology, not a lot of mechanism.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.940]   And now we're going to transition
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.460]   into talking about mechanism,
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.240]   hormones, receptors, et cetera.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:35.100]   Puberty is a absolute biological event.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:39.340]   It has a beginning and it has a specific definition,
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.660]   which is the transition into reproductive maturity.
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.200]   So there are a lot of hormonal changes.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.940]   Yes, there are also a lot of brain changes
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.140]   and most people don't realize it,
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.400]   but the brain changes occur first.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.980]   The brain turns on the hormone systems
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.840]   that allow puberty to occur.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:58.440]   Puberty is occurring earlier nowadays
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.280]   than it did in the past.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.620]   The current numbers that I was able to find
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:06.940]   is that in females and girls,
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.580]   the transition is starting around age 10,
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:11.940]   whereas in boys, it's about age 12.
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.700]   That's going to differ by way
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.860]   of a number of different factors.
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.300]   Those are averages.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.580]   So it depends on where you are in the world,
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.020]   depends on all sorts of things.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.380]   One of the primary triggers for puberty
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.820]   is actually body fat.
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.300]   This is interesting.
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:30.200]   The peptide hormone leptin,
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.180]   some people call it a peptide,
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.220]   some people call it a hormone,
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:34.880]   but it meets both definitions,
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.480]   depending on how you look at it,
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.460]   is made by fat.
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:42.740]   So leptin had a lot of popularity in the '90s
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:46.700]   because it was discovered as being produced by fat
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.420]   and it was seen in animal studies
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:50.300]   that it could promote leanness.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.300]   It actually communicates to the brain
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.820]   that there's enough body fat
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:57.300]   in order to allow the metabolic factors
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.720]   and processes to occur to liberate more fat.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.700]   This is why people have trouble losing that last five pounds
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.740]   is because leptin levels are very low.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:05.800]   This was actually the basis
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.980]   for the whole cheat day refeed thing,
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:12.020]   that the idea was if you eat a lot for one day a week
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.420]   while dieting hard,
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.580]   that you can signal to the brain that there's enough leptin.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.100]   I don't know if that's the reason
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:19.300]   or whether or not the cheat days
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.840]   just provided some psychological relief, probably both.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.840]   But in any case, leptin is made by body fat
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.260]   and when there's enough leptin,
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:30.580]   it signals the brain to trigger puberty.
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:33.360]   There was a paper published in the mid '90s
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.580]   in the journal Science, excellent journal,
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:40.580]   showing that leptin could be injected into younger females
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:44.380]   that would not have yet gone into puberty
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:47.860]   and you could accelerate the onset of puberty with leptin.
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.820]   So the more body fat, the earlier puberty, that's true.
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.420]   Leptin is also involved
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:55.260]   in various growth effects in the body generally.
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:58.400]   And it's interesting, very obese children
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.780]   don't necessarily undergo puberty earlier.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:04.160]   Sometimes they do, but they do tend to be larger boned.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.740]   Their bones actually grow more quickly
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.500]   and they tend to have higher bone density
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.900]   because leptin is also involved in bone density.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:14.420]   The whole issue of onset of puberty
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.540]   also has some really interesting social effects.
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:21.340]   And I want to really highlight that most of these effects
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.740]   are so-called pheromone effects.
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.440]   Remember, a hormone is a substance
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.760]   secreted from one area of the body,
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.280]   travels and impacts tissues and cells elsewhere in the body.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.080]   A pheromone is a chemical that's released
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.580]   by one member of a species that goes and acts on
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.780]   and impacts other members of that species
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:39.780]   or even other species.
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:43.540]   So for instance, rodents are very good at detecting
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:48.420]   the urine and the scent markings of large carnivores
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.420]   that want to eat them.
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:51.600]   So that's a pheromonal interaction.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.940]   Whether or not there are pheromonal effects in humans
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:56.160]   is very debated.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.440]   I did a post on this on Instagram a little while ago
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:00.620]   about some pheromone effects that were reported in humans.
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:04.140]   And I had a couple of people come at me saying,
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:06.600]   look, it's never really been shown in humans
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.280]   that there's a pheromonal,
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.740]   what's called the vomeronasal organ.
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:11.580]   There's something called Jacobson's organ.
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.120]   It's rudimentary.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.500]   Some people have it, some people don't.
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.560]   Very controversial.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.880]   So I want to point out that human pheromone effects
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.820]   are controversial.
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:22.380]   Although I think there's, in my opinion,
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.080]   there's ample evidence for them.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.060]   Synchronization of menstrual cycles.
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:29.200]   For many people report, then people say,
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.700]   there's some studies that show that it's not true.
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:35.540]   Then there've been some data showing very impressive
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:40.320]   pheromonal effects of female partners
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:43.700]   being able to detect the odor of their significant others
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.780]   on t-shirts that were washed several times.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.220]   So they can't consciously perceive it,
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.440]   but they say, this one smells like them.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.980]   This one smells like my partner.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:55.660]   And indeed the match was way above chance.
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.560]   So there does seem to be weak pheromonal effects,
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.500]   at least in my opinion, when I look at the data,
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.240]   but much more needs to be done.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:05.240]   So one of the more interesting pheromone effects
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:09.020]   that impacts puberty, at least in animal models,
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:10.620]   is the so-called Vandenberg effect,
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:14.380]   which is if you take a pre-pubertal female,
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:18.580]   so a female that has not undergone sexual maturation,
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:22.700]   and you introduce a novel male that is not the father
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.540]   or a brother, not a sibling,
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:29.420]   she will undergo puberty almost immediately.
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:30.580]   So this is really striking.
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:33.500]   For years, this was thought not to occur in primate species,
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.860]   but there was a paper published last year
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:38.780]   in Current Biology Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:42.980]   showing that mandrills, a particular type of primate,
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.420]   they exhibit this Vandenberg effect.
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:49.900]   There are also all sorts of other pheromone effects.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.820]   There's the most infamous one is called the Bruce effect,
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:57.500]   where the introduction of a novel male
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:02.500]   to a pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:07.000]   And that effect seems to be protected against
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.640]   by the presence of the father.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.260]   So another, you know, the interpretation of this,
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:16.480]   and I want to really highlight that these are animal studies,
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:21.480]   but the way this works is that if a pregnant female
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:25.720]   is in the company of the male that impregnated her,
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:30.560]   then her young are protected by his scent presence
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:31.740]   or his pheromone presence.
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:36.100]   But if he's gone and a novel male shows up,
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:40.020]   there's a tendency for her to spontaneously miscarry
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.800]   and essentially for the fetus to be lost.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.440]   Now, whether or not this occurs in humans
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.880]   is still very controversial,
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.900]   but nonetheless, these pheromone effects exist.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:54.140]   And that one is called the Bruce effect
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.380]   named after Hilda Bruce,
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:59.140]   who is the scientist that discovered it.
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.580]   The one that's relevant to the puberty discussion
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:02.960]   is the Vandenberg effect,
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.820]   which I mentioned a few minutes ago,
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:08.460]   which is a novel male showing up,
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.000]   has to be a sexually competent male.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.980]   So he has to have already passed through puberty
[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:17.400]   and his presence triggers activation of puberty
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.080]   in a female that otherwise would have remained
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.680]   pre-pubertal for longer.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:25.000]   Again, whether or not this happens in humans, unclear.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Well, what can we be sure about when we think about puberty?
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.020]   Puberty is triggered by a number of different factors.
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.200]   There are changes in GABA expression in the brain
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.680]   and inhibitory transmitter.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:40.040]   One of the more interesting molecules that triggers puberty
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:43.600]   in all individuals is something called kisspeptin.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:48.600]   K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:52.020]   Kisspeptin is made by the brain
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:56.200]   and it stimulates large amounts of a different hormone
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:01.080]   called GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone to be released.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.800]   Gonadotropin-releasing hormone
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.480]   then causes the release of another hormone
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:08.380]   called something called luteinizing hormone or LH,
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:10.500]   which travels in the bloodstream
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:13.920]   and stimulates the ovaries of females to produce estrogen
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:16.960]   and the testes of males to produce testosterone.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.500]   Kisspeptin has other effects as well,
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.760]   but those are some of the main ones
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.760]   as they relate to puberty.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.640]   This is interesting because at this point,
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:32.280]   the testes in males start churning out tons of testosterone
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:34.280]   in order to trigger the development
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.660]   of secondary sexual characteristics,
[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:39.280]   body hair and all the others, deepening of voice, et cetera.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:43.240]   And in females, estrogen is doing various other things,
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.740]   breast development, et cetera.
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:51.000]   Normally in an adult, somebody who has passed puberty,
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.940]   a big increase in gonadotropin-releasing hormone
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.880]   and luteinizing hormone would eventually be shut down
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.120]   because the way that the brain works,
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.000]   the hypothalamus and the pituitary
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.680]   are actually measuring how much hormone is in the blood.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.520]   And if testosterone or estrogen
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.540]   or any other hormone goes too high,
[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:09.740]   they shut down the release of things
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:10.880]   like luteinizing hormone.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.040]   It's called a negative feedback loop.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.060]   It basically is like a thermostat in a house.
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.180]   It's more complicated than that,
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:19.360]   but once levels get too high in the bloodstream,
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:20.380]   it shuts down.
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:23.820]   But kisspeptin is able to drive very high levels
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:25.580]   of these hormones in an ongoing way
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:28.320]   so that puberty can commence and can continue.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:31.960]   And incidentally, kisspeptin has now become
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:36.960]   yet another of the panoply of hormones and peptides
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.240]   and cocktails that athletes take
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:42.480]   in order to try and stimulate natural hormone production,
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.000]   essentially to create their own
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.220]   performance-enhancing drugs endogenously.
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.900]   No judgment there, but that's a fact.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:50.680]   There's a lot of kisspeptin use.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:53.520]   I'm truly not suggesting anyone do this,
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:56.760]   but people are buying and injecting kisspeptin
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:00.160]   for the specific reason that even past puberty
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:04.720]   can stimulate the large increases in things like estrogen,
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.820]   large increases in testosterone, and things of that sort.
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.220]   Has a number of psychological effects too.
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:13.240]   Seems to have big effects on libido, et cetera.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:16.400]   All these things, of course, are subject to feedback loops,
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.000]   so they don't work indefinitely.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   And I'm going to highlight, again,
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.260]   I'm not suggesting anyone do it,
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:23.000]   but I do like to pay attention to what's out there.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.120]   And kisspeptin, because it wasn't discovered that long ago,
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.860]   is one of the things that you don't often hear about
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:31.760]   when people talk about performance-enhancing drugs
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.960]   or therapeutic endocrinology.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.300]   These things also have therapeutic uses
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.260]   in the endocrine setting.
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.360]   So for instance, kids that don't undergo puberty
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:44.300]   or kids that are hypogonadal or adults that are hypogonadal,
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:45.640]   they're not making enough hormone,
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:49.740]   will take things like kisspeptin, among other things.
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:53.000]   So that's how puberty happens at the biological level,
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.960]   gets triggered by leptin and kisspeptin.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:59.960]   And then this young child is now a different creature
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.240]   to some extent.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.580]   Not just because they're reproductively competent, of course,
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:08.920]   but because there's a shift in a number of the things
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.620]   that underlie these social bonds.
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:15.440]   There's a marked shift in a number of the things
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:19.000]   that allow children and adults
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.280]   to engage in predictive behavior about each other.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:26.120]   And the whole nature of adolescence and puberty
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:30.360]   is to take a child that was a generalist
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.900]   and to make them a specialist.
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.360]   And this is very important
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:36.540]   as it relates to the conversation about emotionality.
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:40.000]   But it's important in terms of all aspects
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.840]   of brain function and in terms of learning
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.420]   and in terms of who each and every one of us
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:45.920]   will and has become.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:49.760]   In adolescence and in childhood,
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:52.160]   sure, there are some genetic biases,
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.760]   hair color, eye color, height, and things like that.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.960]   A lot of that's programmed into the genome.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:01.660]   There are other genetic biases too, of course,
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:03.160]   that we inherit.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:06.600]   But it's in adolescence and puberty
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:09.480]   that we go from essentially being somewhat good
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:13.600]   at a bunch of things or somewhat poor at a bunch of things
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.240]   to becoming very good at a few things
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.600]   and very poor at a lot of other things.
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.000]   And that's because of the relationship
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.560]   to puberty and neuroplasticity.
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:25.120]   This ability to change the brain in response to experience
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:29.320]   is starting to taper off such that by our early 20s,
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.220]   it's harder to achieve.
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:34.360]   Now, the transition from generalist to specialist
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.780]   is one aspect of adolescence and puberty,
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:39.740]   but the other is the formation of social
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:40.760]   and emotional bonds.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.960]   And most of what consumes the minds
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:47.720]   and waking hours of adolescents and children
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.060]   who have gone through puberty and going through puberty
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:54.720]   is questions about how they relate to social structures,
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.420]   who they can rely on,
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:59.000]   and how they can make reliable predictions in the world
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.600]   now that they have more agency,
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.240]   that they are physically changed.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.520]   In fact, you could argue that puberty
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.200]   is the fastest rate of maturation
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.360]   that you'll go through at any point in your life.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.240]   It's the largest change that you'll go through
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.640]   at any point in your life in terms of who you are
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.680]   because your biology is fundamentally changed
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:20.120]   at the level of your brain and your bodily organs,
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:23.240]   all your organs from the skin inward.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.520]   So I want to visit a little bit of the research
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.320]   about some of the core needs
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:32.160]   that occur during puberty and adolescence,
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.740]   not just for parents or for the people
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.240]   that might be in puberty and adolescence,
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.440]   but also so that people can reflect
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:42.800]   on which of these sort of boxes were checked off for them
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.720]   as they approached emotional maturity.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.040]   So there's a terrific review article
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.040]   that was published in the journal "Nature,"
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.520]   which is, if not the premier,
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.520]   then certainly among the top three premier journals
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.920]   in the field of science
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.620]   about the biology of adolescence and puberty,
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:06.520]   as well as some of the core needs and demands
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.800]   that have to be met for successful emotional maturation
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.320]   during that time.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.060]   We will provide a link to that,
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.980]   but I just want to highlight a few of the things
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:18.200]   that they place in the final table.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.100]   I don't want to go through all the results right now
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.440]   because you could do that on your own if you like.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.240]   They mainly highlight a lot of the changes in neurons
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.480]   and neural circuits.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.500]   For instance, I'll just highlight one.
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.180]   There's a connection between the dopamine centers
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.980]   in the brain and an area of the brain
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:37.640]   that's involved in emotion and dispersal.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.240]   Dispersal is very interesting.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.760]   What you observe in animals and humans
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.400]   is that around the end of adolescence
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.580]   and during the transition to puberty,
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.560]   both because of changes in the brain
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.320]   and changes in hormones,
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:57.000]   there's an intense desire on the part of the child
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   to get further and further away from primary caregivers.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.040]   Not permanently, they always return,
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.760]   similar to a child that walks off and then looks back
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.980]   and sees if everything's safe and then continues on.
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.040]   During adolescence and puberty,
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.480]   both in animals and in kids,
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.760]   it almost seems like there's a bias for action
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.520]   and the action is always in a direction away
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.120]   from the primary caregiver.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.780]   Now, as soon as I say that,
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.120]   I can just imagine in my mind
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.080]   that somebody out there saying,
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.400]   "Well, no, my kid, as soon as they hit puberty,
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.640]   they just want to stay home with us all the time."
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.800]   That's not typical.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.540]   It happens, but it's not typical.
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.600]   Mostly there's a desire to start spending
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.640]   more time with friends, more time with peers,
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:39.080]   and less time with adults.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.200]   And I find it extremely interesting to note
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.740]   that that's not just true in humans,
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:44.960]   that's true in other primate species,
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.320]   that's true in rodents,
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.180]   that's true in almost every other mammalian species.
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.300]   So there's something about these hormones
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:55.660]   that don't just allow sexual reproduction.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:57.680]   They don't just change the brain and bodily organs
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.580]   and the shape of us.
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:03.080]   They also bias us towards dispersal,
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.400]   getting further and further away
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.240]   from primary caregivers in particular.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.980]   So parents of teenagers or future teenagers,
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.840]   it is not just normal,
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.240]   it is baked in to the biology of humans
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.160]   to disperse around adolescents and in the teen years.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.700]   So again, I just want to highlight a few of these,
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:24.680]   what were listed as intervention strategies
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.760]   to promote healthy adolescence and puberty.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.000]   And it's very interesting because the entire article,
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.720]   I should mention who wrote this article, apologies,
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.480]   one of them is a friend of mine.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:40.400]   So the first author is Ronald Dahl,
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.020]   not the children's book author, I'm assuming.
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.800]   No, from the School of Public Health
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.460]   at University of California, Berkeley.
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:51.800]   And Nicholas Allen, Linda Wilbrecht,
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.520]   and Anna Ballenhof-Suleman,
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.160]   forgive me for the pronunciation of the last one.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.840]   I know Dr. Wilbrecht quite well,
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.300]   she's done the work on dispersal,
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:04.320]   is quite well known for that work.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.400]   And it's a very extensive review,
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.320]   but I think you'll find it accessible.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.840]   Lot of changes in thickness of the brain
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.200]   at different stages, et cetera.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.800]   But I think most people will be interested
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:20.640]   in what that translates to in the real world.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.120]   And what's interesting is during puberty,
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.000]   there's increased connection, connectivity as we call it,
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.340]   between the prefrontal cortex,
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.260]   which is involved in motivation and decision-making,
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:36.740]   being able to suppress action for making long-term goals
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:41.160]   possible, as well as dopamine centers and the amygdala.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.580]   So there's this really broad integration and testing,
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.180]   I think this is the key element here,
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:49.400]   testing of circuits for emotions and reward
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.140]   as they relate to decisions.
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.880]   And I think that's useful because when you look
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.700]   at the behavior of adolescents and teens,
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.480]   they are testing social interactions,
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.540]   they are testing physical interactions with the world.
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:03.080]   Oftentimes they're engaging in unsafe behavior
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:07.620]   and you can't just, I would never try and justify that
[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.680]   with the underlying neurology,
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.520]   but the neuroscience points to increased connectivity
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:16.880]   between areas of the brain that are related to emotionality
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:21.440]   and to threat detection like the amygdala, but also reward.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.880]   So it's a time of testing behaviorally
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:27.500]   how different behaviors lead to success or not.
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:31.200]   It's how different behaviors lead to fear states or not.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.640]   Now, of course you could say that of any stage
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.320]   of development, but it seems like puberty
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.920]   is a very, very heightened stage in which testing
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.240]   of contingencies, good or bad, is taking place.
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.800]   And of course this is happening,
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.620]   it's operating in a body that's now more capable
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:46.760]   than the infant.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.120]   So an infant can damage themselves through error,
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.700]   but it's harder for them to damage themselves
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.660]   through deliberate planning.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:55.720]   That's why it's important, of course,
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.760]   to lock up all the medications in the house,
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.640]   make sure infants can't get to them,
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:03.780]   but it's not likely that the infant is going to devise
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:07.060]   an extremely diabolical plan to get into the cabinet
[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:12.000]   to get a certain substance, whereas a teenager might, right?
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.440]   So you can start to map the neurology
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.980]   onto some of this emotional exploration.
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:19.240]   I do realize that this episode is about emotions.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.620]   Puberty is a time in which the internal state
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:26.280]   of the person or the animal is being sampled
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.200]   and tested against different extra receptive events,
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.440]   only now they are able to guide those events
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.520]   with more agency, right?
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.900]   It's no longer just about whether or not the caregiver
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:39.280]   is bringing you milk or bringing you food.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.740]   Now, of course, the parents will all say,
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.520]   "Yeah, but I'm paying for everything that they're doing.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.560]   I'm paying for the car and I'm paying for the food."
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.020]   Ah, true, but the biology doesn't care about the source.
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:52.360]   The child or the adolescent is now able,
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.720]   the teen really, is able to now sample many,
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.440]   many more extra receptive events through behavior.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.800]   So some of these recommendations are interesting.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.880]   The theory is that one of the motivations
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:08.400]   is to learn to mitigate the risk of famine and malnutrition.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.920]   As teenagers get older, they start questioning
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.660]   whether or not their parents
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.280]   are everything they thought they were,
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:17.080]   whether or not they're the greatest thing that ever was
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.120]   or the worst thing that ever was perhaps,
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.620]   including whether or not they will be able to provide them
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:24.400]   resources so they test whether or not
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.100]   they can actually feed themselves,
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:28.960]   whether or not they can support themselves.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.480]   Although rarely, not certainly it happens,
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.360]   but rarely are they really taking care of themselves.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.520]   Although some teens are forced to take care of themselves,
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.940]   of course, because parents and other caretakers
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:41.320]   aren't available.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:45.300]   The recommendations that map to the biology include later,
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:48.160]   there's been a big push for later start times in schools
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.680]   to match their shifts in circadian rhythms
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:51.960]   and the need for extended sleep,
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.560]   something we talked about during the sleep episodes,
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:00.080]   to insist on sleep interventions for youth
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.900]   who are at increased risk for mental health problems.
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:06.160]   Almost every mental health issue is supported
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:10.400]   by getting regular quality sleep of sufficient duration.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.080]   Sufficient duration is going to vary from person to person.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:16.480]   Leveraging different kinds of social relationships
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:18.400]   that reinforce positive behavior.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:21.480]   This is starting to sound like kind of a boilerplate stuff.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:24.440]   And yet, really the goal is during puberty
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:28.200]   to encourage as many safe forms of interaction
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.220]   that allow children, teens really, and adolescents,
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:33.180]   I keep calling them children,
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.160]   but what I mean are children going through puberty,
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.360]   that allow them to test this thing of autonomy
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:43.440]   so that they can start to make good assessments
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:47.760]   about their extra receptive events that they are selecting
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.440]   and how those make them feel internally.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.280]   So they're essentially doing a buffet.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:53.000]   The buffet has now broadened
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.280]   to not just include the events and experiences
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.540]   that their parents and other caretakers bring them,
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.520]   but they can now expand the buffet
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.080]   into things that they can provide themselves.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.800]   And so adolescence and puberty
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.280]   is really seen as the period of development
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:11.520]   in which one self samples for these two elements
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.960]   that we talked about at the beginning,
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.360]   which are how do I form bonds
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.840]   and how do I make predictions
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.600]   about what will make me feel good
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.600]   at a level of interoception?
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.520]   Some of that might sound a little transactional,
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.440]   that all we're trying to do is figure out
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.640]   how we can bond with people so we can get what we need
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:32.720]   so we can feel how we need.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.320]   I think that's true to some extent.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.840]   Of course, there's a richer,
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:40.560]   more abstract aspect to relationships too,
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.040]   which are in relationships
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.960]   you can access things you couldn't do before,
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.280]   you can cooperate, there's things like teamwork,
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.140]   you can do all sorts of things.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.820]   But in terms of the biology,
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:52.120]   it's clear that there's this stage of development
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:56.240]   where more autonomy, more physical capability
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.880]   is triggered by these hormone changes in the brain
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.320]   and these peptide changes in the brain and body.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:04.280]   And that nonetheless brings us back
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.780]   to the exact same model that we started with in infancy
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:12.400]   of alert or calm, feel good or feel bad,
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:16.980]   primarily exterocepting, primarily interocepting.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.380]   So I keep going back to this.
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.500]   I'm sort of like a repeating record on that
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.900]   because the same core algorithm,
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:26.740]   the same core function is at play throughout the lifespan.
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:29.340]   And that's a useful framework in my opinion,
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.620]   because it allows you to sort through
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:33.780]   all the data and information that's out there about,
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:36.020]   well, this area, the stria terminalis is active
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:37.700]   or the basolateral amygdala is active
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.580]   or gray matter thickening or this hormone or that hormone
[01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:43.360]   and return to a kind of kernel
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.820]   of certainly not exhaustive truth.
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:48.140]   It doesn't cover all aspects of emotionality,
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:51.140]   but at least establishes some groundwork
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.860]   from which you can start to evaluate
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:56.780]   how different behaviors might or might not make sense,
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:58.580]   how certain emotional responses
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:00.340]   might or might not make sense,
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:03.620]   regardless of the age of the person or the organism.
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:06.760]   A discussion about emotions would not be complete
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:11.760]   without talking about the right brain, left brain stuff.
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:17.100]   And this is a very interesting aspect of sociology,
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:19.040]   psychology, and neuroscience.
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.220]   There's a theory of emotional development
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:24.840]   that I find particularly interesting,
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.940]   which is from Alan Shore at UCLA,
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:29.920]   that talks about how most of our testing of bonds
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.120]   and relationships is this seesawing back and forth
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:36.320]   between very dopaminergic, so driven by dopamine
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.620]   or serotonergic, driven by serotonin states.
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.820]   And this starts with infant and mother
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:43.200]   or infant and father.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.200]   I talked a little bit about this in the previous episode,
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.300]   but just to remind you or for anyone
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:50.040]   that didn't hear about it, that during development,
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.780]   healthy emotional development clearly begins
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:56.680]   with an ability for the caretaker and child
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:00.280]   to be in calm, peaceful, soothing, touch-oriented,
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.780]   eye-gazing type of behaviors.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:05.080]   Those really drive serotonin,
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:09.720]   the endogenous opioid system, oxytocin,
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.920]   things that are very calming
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:14.020]   and are centered around pleasure with the here and now,
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:17.080]   as well as excited states of what we're going to do next.
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.600]   There's actually a kind of characteristic sign
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.300]   of the dopaminergic interaction
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:26.400]   where both caretaker and child are wide-eyed,
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.880]   the pupils dilate, that's a signature of arousal.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.820]   They get really excited.
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.360]   Oftentimes the baby will look away
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.600]   if it gets really excited.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:35.620]   Those are signatures of dopamine release in the body.
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:38.800]   And in adolescence, these same things carry forward
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.680]   where their good bonds are achieved
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.400]   through hanging around, watching TV,
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.500]   just kind of being there, playing video games
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.460]   or texting together or talking,
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:52.380]   whatever it is that the soothing local activity
[01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:54.740]   happens to be, as well as adventure
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:56.040]   and things that are exciting.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.820]   So it could be sports, it could be shopping,
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.840]   it could be a summer adventure,
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.720]   it could be the next big thing.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.560]   And so this kind of seesawing back and forth
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.640]   between the different reward systems
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.360]   seems to be the basis
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.780]   from which healthy emotional bonds are created.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:12.460]   And I invite anyone who's interested in this
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:16.100]   to look up some of Dr. Schor's work.
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.660]   I think I misspoke on the last episode.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:19.600]   He's not a psychiatrist.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.220]   He's a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst,
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.160]   but has deep rootings in neuroscience.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:27.080]   So it's, I think, a fascinating aspect.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:31.180]   But the way it's framed in that book and in his book
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:32.340]   and in some of the language around that
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.380]   is around right brain, left brain.
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:35.880]   And we've all heard this stuff before
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:39.240]   that the right brain is thought to be the emotional side.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.780]   This is the characteristic thing that you hear out there,
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:45.020]   that the right brain is holistic, that it's emotive,
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.660]   and that the left brain is logical,
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:48.380]   sequential, and analytic.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:52.500]   And that's not what Schor was proposing.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.760]   There are some right brain, left brain differences,
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:58.260]   but the idea that the right brain is synthetic,
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.740]   holistic, and emotive,
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:01.140]   and that the left brain is logical,
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:04.420]   sequential, and analytic is false.
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:08.220]   There is zero neuroscience evidence for that whatsoever.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.460]   We're going to address this in more detail
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.540]   during a month talking about learning and memory
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:16.860]   and dementia, but let's talk about some truths,
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:19.000]   some differences between the left brain and right brain,
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.740]   because we can't have a discussion about emotion
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:21.700]   without doing that.
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:27.300]   The left brain, at least for people who are right-handed,
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:29.100]   is linguistically dominant,
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:31.780]   meaning most of language is centered
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:35.680]   in the left side of the brain for right-handed people.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.140]   If you were a left-hander
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:41.140]   and you were forced to become right-handed,
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:43.900]   chances are this is still true
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:47.760]   because of when language gets laid down in the brain.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:51.060]   For left-handers, people that naturally write
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.600]   with their left hand and always did,
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:57.580]   language is still mostly in the left side of the brain,
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.180]   but it's also found more often
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:02.480]   in the right side of the brain,
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.780]   so it's not as lateralized as we say,
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.800]   it's kind of distributed between both, okay?
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.860]   So right-handers, most of your language
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:10.960]   is coming from the left side of your brain.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.140]   Left-handers, it's probably
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.900]   a little bit more evenly distributed.
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.060]   And there are some variations,
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.740]   whether or not you're a hook righty or a hook lefty,
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.240]   there's all sorts of nuance to this,
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.020]   but that's the general aspect.
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:23.780]   So language tends to be centered
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:24.940]   in the left side of the brain,
[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:28.720]   and that includes lexicon, grammar, syntax, all of it,
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:29.780]   except for one.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:31.500]   And we'll talk about one aspect of language
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.920]   that seems to be more right brain that's very interesting.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.100]   There does seem to be some arithmetic advantage,
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:43.660]   so ability in math, in the left side of the brain.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:44.500]   And I'm going to talk about
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.940]   how all this was discovered in a minute.
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:51.020]   The right brain, however, is linguistically primitive.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:52.060]   Most people don't realize this
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.660]   because the right brain is always described
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.820]   as the emotive side, it's super emotional and holistic,
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:59.140]   but it's actually linguistically primitive.
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:01.620]   And there's a way that that's been teased out
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:03.240]   through experiment.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:06.640]   It's very good at manipulating spatial things
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.960]   and visual spatial tasks.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:10.940]   It's primarily handling that stuff,
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:15.000]   but it's sort of non-language, except one aspect.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.620]   And there isn't a ton of evidence for this,
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:19.580]   but the evidence is strong, which is prosody.
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:23.920]   Prosody is the lilting and falling of language.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.940]   So a good example would be Italian.
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:27.860]   I don't speak Italian.
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.660]   I only know a little bit of Italian,
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:31.260]   but most of the Italian I know
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:34.280]   is when my Italian colleagues have said to me,
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.120]   [speaking in foreign language]
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.540]   which means like, what are you trying to say?
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:37.380]   Or what are you saying?
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:39.100]   I think I'm getting that right.
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:40.560]   Basically, they're saying I don't speak Italian,
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.540]   which is true.
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:45.500]   Or because one of them knows and loves Costello very much,
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.460]   they always say, [speaking in foreign language]
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:49.220]   which means big lazy guy,
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:51.500]   which accurately captures Costello.
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.780]   So even those few examples, right?
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:57.420]   [speaking in foreign language]
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:59.980]   There's a lot of lilt and fall in Italian.
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.520]   Other languages, not so much, and it varies by language.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.580]   One of the reasons I find Italian so beautiful,
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:05.660]   not the Italian I speak,
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:07.640]   but the Italian that other people speak,
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:10.180]   so beautiful to listen to is that prosody
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:13.980]   and the shifts in intonation are really quite remarkable.
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:17.320]   It's almost like a sing song, listening to them speak.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.000]   And I used to like to go to scientific meetings
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.700]   and I always hang out with the Italians
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.680]   'cause I have some good friends in Italian labs,
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.400]   but also 'cause they always knew where the best food was.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.620]   Their standards for food are incredible.
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:29.300]   They would rather starve than eat terrible pasta.
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:30.660]   And the pasta they do find
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:33.080]   and that they're willing to eat is always fantastic.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.420]   But in addition to that, they always brought a guitar.
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:37.900]   They were a lot more fun than a lot of my other colleagues
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:39.300]   to hang out with at meetings.
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:42.300]   So in any event, the right brain is doing things
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:45.220]   that are more about manipulating spatial information.
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:47.340]   And I'll talk about this more in a future episode,
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:50.800]   but this was discovered in split brain patients,
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.060]   so people that lack connection
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:53.940]   between the two sides of the brain.
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:55.500]   And this had to be teased out
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.860]   through very complicated experiments.
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:59.340]   People like Roger Sperry, who won a Nobel Prize for this,
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:02.340]   who was at Caltech, Mike Gazzaniga and others,
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:05.780]   figured out these lateralized differences.
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:09.240]   But let's just try and demolish the myth
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:13.620]   that the right side is synthetic and holistic and emotive
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:15.900]   and that the left side is logical, sequential and analytic,
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:18.340]   that you're a left brain person or a right brain person.
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:19.780]   Nothing could be further from the truth.
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:21.820]   There's no scientific evidence to support that.
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:25.280]   And there's a few lesion studies that can tease out effects
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.560]   that make you think that's what's happening,
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.100]   but the really careful work
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.180]   points in a totally different direction.
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:34.780]   We can't have a complete conversation about emotions
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.580]   and bonds and social connection
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:38.700]   without talking about oxytocin.
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:40.700]   Oxytocin has come to such prominence
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:43.800]   in the last decade or so, and seems to be everywhere.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.560]   Anytime you hear a discussion about neuroscience
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.480]   in the brain or hormones in the brain,
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:55.840]   oxytocin is released in response to lactation in females.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:00.640]   It is released in response to sexual interactions.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:05.140]   It is released in response to non-sexual touch.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:08.220]   It's released in males and females.
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:11.380]   And indeed it's involved in pair bonding
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:14.480]   and the establishment of social bonds in general.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:21.180]   How it does that seems to be by matching internal state.
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:24.680]   It seems to both increase synchrony
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.860]   of internal state somehow.
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:29.460]   Maybe it sets a level of calmness or alertness.
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:31.640]   That seems like a reasonable hypothesis.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:35.640]   As well as raising people's awareness
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:39.260]   for the emotional state of their partner.
[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:42.300]   And again, this brings us back to this alertness
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:46.620]   calmness axis and this interoceptive, exteroceptive axis.
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:49.100]   In order to form good bonds,
[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:52.260]   we can't just be thinking about how we feel.
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.880]   We also need to be paying attention to how others feel.
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.260]   And we're evaluating a match.
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.340]   We're trying to see whether or not there seems
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:02.460]   to be some sort of synchrony between states.
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:06.220]   And oxytocin both seems to increase that synchrony
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:10.400]   and increase the awareness for the emotional state of others.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.220]   Now, I know many of you are probably screaming
[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:15.520]   mirror neurons, mirror neurons.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.540]   Mirror neurons, as some of you may know
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:19.580]   and some of you perhaps may not,
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:22.780]   are neurons that were discovered in animals and humans
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:26.460]   for their ability to respond
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:29.780]   when people engaged in certain physical actions
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:31.200]   like lifting of a pen.
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.600]   But the same neurons would respond
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:37.100]   when somebody watched someone else lift a pen.
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.580]   So they were really mirrors of,
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:43.000]   or representing mirrors of behavior
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.860]   both in self and in others.
[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:49.000]   Mirror neurons are very controversial.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.160]   There are many neuroscientists who I respect a lot
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.440]   who don't think they exist
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:56.900]   because they look at the data and the data,
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:57.740]   at least in their mind,
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:01.460]   were over-interpreted in the realm of empathy
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:05.340]   and in assigning value to the emotional states of others.
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.880]   And when I look at the literature,
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:11.880]   my opinion is that indeed there are neurons in the brain
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:15.360]   that clearly represent the actions of others,
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.580]   but it's not clear that they're wired into the emotion
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:19.840]   and empathy system in any direct way.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:22.620]   And I think the growing consensus is that mirror neurons,
[01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:27.200]   while the name is terrific, is so catchy
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.220]   and encompasses so much of what you would love for it
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:32.060]   to encompass, but that the data don't really support that.
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:33.100]   But this is controversial
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:35.920]   and I'm perfectly happy to get experts on here
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.940]   that could debate it better than I could.
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:42.220]   There are, however, neurons in the brain
[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:45.340]   that were discovered by my colleague, Karen Harush
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:49.460]   at Stanford when she was working in Noam Ziv's lab
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:55.420]   that clearly point to the fact that primate species
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:00.880]   are making assumptions and are trying to predict
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:03.860]   the behavior of other members of their species.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:05.020]   It's an experiment I don't have time
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.140]   to go into in real detail,
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:07.940]   which probably just get Karen on here.
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:09.120]   For those of you that are familiar
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.260]   with the prisoner's dilemma,
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.120]   which is really a model of cooperation,
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.500]   you can either cooperate
[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:18.860]   or one member of a given interaction can cooperate
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:22.460]   and the other one won't, or you can both not cooperate.
[01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:24.820]   There are ways in which you can solve
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.400]   this so-called prisoner's dilemma by looking
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.940]   at previous behavior and making predictions
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.840]   about the likely next behavior
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.560]   that the other individual will engage in.
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:36.960]   And there do seem to be neurons
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:40.800]   that are doing these sorts of predictions or computations.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.660]   And again, I'll go into this in more detail in the future.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:46.480]   So rather than think about mirror neurons,
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:50.620]   like neurons for empathy, I think it's more correct
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.340]   to think about neurons that are trying
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:54.260]   to predict the behavior of others.
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:57.020]   And that's, as we said, one of the core features
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:23:01.420]   of emotions, which are to establish bonds
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:03.980]   and through those bonds to be able to predict behavior.
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:07.580]   So oxytocin is one component of this ability
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:11.420]   to predict others' behavior and to guide our own behavior.
[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:15.620]   So here's some experiments that involve the administration
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:17.460]   of intranasal oxytocin.
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:19.220]   This is actually, people now,
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:20.420]   I think you need a prescription,
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.640]   although in some places you don't.
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:24.440]   There are people who are taking intranasal oxytocin
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:27.360]   in order to try and increase the depth of bonding.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.560]   And I don't recommend you do that.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.000]   I've never tried that.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.480]   Whatever oxytocin I've released,
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:37.200]   I've made without an intranasal exogenous application.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:39.520]   But what's been reported
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:43.040]   is increased positive communication among couples.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.600]   So people have taken intranasal oxytocin in studies.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.920]   So that study, just for those of you who like,
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:50.460]   was published in biological psychiatry,
[01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:53.940]   which my psychiatry colleagues tell me is a fine journal.
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:56.040]   And the title is intranasal oxytocin
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.820]   increases positive communication
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:00.300]   and reduces the stress hormone cortisol levels
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:01.780]   during couple conflict.
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:04.460]   They have them fight,
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:07.880]   or they have them fight with and without oxytocin.
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:08.720]   So interesting.
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:12.300]   Very much in line with the idea that oxytocin
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.820]   is the quote unquote trust hormone.
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:16.880]   That's in keeping with that.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.580]   That was a 2009 paper.
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.240]   There's other evidence, for instance,
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:24.600]   that men report a greater sense of connection
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.360]   and intimacy with their partners during sex
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:30.040]   after taking intranasal oxytocin.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.640]   There are studies in autistic children
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.500]   giving them intranasal oxytocin
[01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.660]   as a way to try and help them
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:39.200]   establish better social connection
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:42.780]   and quote unquote empathy or theory of mind.
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:44.440]   I've talked about theory of mind before,
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:48.260]   where understanding of what other children
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:50.180]   or adults are experiencing.
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:54.740]   So oxytocin does seem to create these general effects
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:58.820]   and how nuanced they are in one situation or another,
[01:24:58.820 --> 01:24:59.820]   I don't know.
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:01.400]   I'm aware and I was told,
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:02.900]   and I'm definitely not recommending this,
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:07.340]   that there's a marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray.
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:08.920]   Now I have no idea.
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.800]   Maybe someone can put in the comments
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:14.200]   why you'd want to combine oxytocin and ketamine.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.960]   I can't imagine why.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:18.220]   Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:20.520]   that's used for the treatment of PTSD,
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:23.340]   used to be used as a recreational drug.
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:27.720]   It's very similar to PCP, seems quite dangerous in fact.
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:32.700]   I don't know why those two things would be combined,
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:34.620]   why one would want to combine them,
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.980]   but there are products out there
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:38.560]   that seem to combine those two things.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.560]   And I'm not certain why one would do that,
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.180]   but it's interesting to note that it's happening.
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:47.420]   A particularly interesting study about oxytocin
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:49.620]   is that that was published in the Journal of Neuroscience,
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:50.820]   which is a good journal,
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:54.220]   that oxytocin modulates social distance
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:56.500]   between males and females.
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:57.480]   So this is interesting.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.140]   What they did is they gave oxytocin
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:03.460]   to people that were in monogamous relationships,
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:06.620]   and then they evaluated the extent to which the,
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:08.420]   in this case, the males in those relationships
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:10.020]   would pay attention to,
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:14.080]   visual attention to attractive other potential partners.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.820]   And it seemed like that the general takeaway from the study
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:18.580]   is that oxytocin administration
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:20.900]   seemed to promote monogamous behavior.
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:22.900]   So behavior that was in line with monogamy
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:24.420]   of the relationship that they were in,
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:28.000]   as opposed to foraging for potentially new mates.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.240]   Now, of course, these are somewhat artificial experiments
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:31.580]   or very artificial experiments,
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.360]   depending on how you interpret them.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.900]   But the general theme is that oxytocin
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:41.460]   is promoting monogamy, it's promoting pair bonding,
[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:44.260]   it's promoting a understanding
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:46.820]   of the internal state of others,
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:49.300]   which requires enhanced exteroception
[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:50.840]   for those particular others.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.020]   So not just generally having them look everywhere
[01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:55.220]   and see what's going on in the world,
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:57.220]   but particularly paying attention
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:59.680]   to the emotional states of others.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.220]   I'm sure several of you will be asking,
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:03.540]   well, what can I do to increase oxytocin,
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:04.700]   if that's your goal?
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:05.680]   There's some evidence,
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.460]   and I invite you again to go to examine.com
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:11.140]   or another such site like PubMed,
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:12.740]   if you want to forge PubMed,
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:16.300]   that vitamin D is required for proper production,
[01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:19.660]   and in some cases can increase levels of oxytocin
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:21.820]   when supplemented, which is interesting.
[01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.860]   And that, believe it or not, melatonin,
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:24.900]   our old friend melatonin,
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:29.340]   which I have pushed back against as a supplement for sleep
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:32.160]   because of some of what I view
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.320]   as untoward side effects of melatonin in most cases.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:38.220]   But it seems like melatonin, in some cases,
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:43.100]   can prime the system for slightly increased
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:44.660]   oxytocin release.
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:45.840]   There's even one report,
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:48.220]   although it didn't look that strong to me,
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:51.820]   that low doses of caffeine could increase oxytocin release,
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:54.500]   but that to me falls under the category
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.900]   of what was once described as a drug
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:00.060]   when injected into a person or animal
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:02.760]   is always effective at producing a scientific paper,
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.180]   meaning that you can get a result,
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:06.160]   but the result isn't always so robust.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.480]   So you always want to read past the titles and the abstracts
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:10.260]   and get into the meat of the paper.
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:11.420]   And when I did that,
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:14.520]   the effects were pretty negligible with caffeine on oxytocin.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.880]   But it's interesting that vitamin D and melatonin
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.600]   may have some positive effects on oxytocin release.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.360]   But like I said, many people are just taking oxytocin
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:24.700]   directly through these intranasal sprays.
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:28.220]   I'm pretty sure it's prescription in most places, but check.
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.320]   And again, I'm not recommending anybody do that.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.520]   I've never tried it.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.360]   I don't know that I will.
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.280]   I think I'm going to stick with the oxytocin that I've got.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.180]   The other molecule that we make that's extremely important
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:40.520]   for social bonds and emotionality
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:41.900]   is one that we're going to talk about more
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:45.560]   in the month on hormones, and that's vasopressin.
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:48.540]   Vasopressin suppresses urination.
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:51.960]   It was actually developed, it's made by the body,
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.920]   but it was developed as a treatment
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.840]   for something called diabetes insipidus
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:58.120]   where people urinate excessively
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.840]   and they actually risk dehydration
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:02.000]   and they can lose a lot of electrolytes, et cetera.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.900]   So it causes water retention.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:06.920]   Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:08.360]   So large amounts of alcohol,
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.900]   made people excrete a lot of fluid and so forth.
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:15.260]   Vasopressin has effects on the brain directly.
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:18.920]   It actually creates feelings of giddy love.
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:22.660]   It also increases memory in very potent ways.
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:24.900]   There's a whole biohacking community
[01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:29.180]   that has been dabbling with vasopressin for some time.
[01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:30.060]   I have never tried it.
[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:31.100]   I certainly don't recommend it.
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:35.680]   It is prescription and it is a pretty serious compound
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.400]   to start messing with
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:42.000]   because it has so many different effects in the body.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.460]   It's interesting because it creates the sense of giddy love.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:49.960]   It's also used somewhat as an aphrodisiac.
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:52.380]   So it's similar to oxytocin.
[01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:55.160]   It also has very interesting effects on monogamous
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.320]   or non-monogamous behavior.
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:59.440]   This, again, we will revisit in the future,
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:02.360]   but there's a beautiful set of experiments
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.460]   that have been done in a little rodent species
[01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:05.880]   called a prairie vole.
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.440]   It turns out there are two different populations
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.280]   of prairie voles.
[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:09.120]   Some are monogamous.
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:12.720]   They always mate with the same other prairie vole
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:16.280]   and some are very robustly non-monogamous.
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.640]   They mate with as many other prairie voles as they can.
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.800]   And it turns out that levels of vasopressin
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:23.040]   and/or vasopressin receptor dictate
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.920]   whether or not they're monogamous or not.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:27.560]   And there's actually some interesting evidence in humans
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.480]   when people report their behavior,
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:31.520]   assuming they're reporting it accurately,
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:34.000]   that vasopressin and vasopressin levels
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.400]   can relate to monogamy or non-monogamy in humans as well.
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:40.960]   We're going to talk about this in the month on hormones.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.780]   If we're talking about the neuroscience of emotions,
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:45.160]   we have to talk about the vagus nerve.
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:48.160]   I described what the vagus nerve is in a previous episode.
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:51.520]   That's these connections between the body and the viscera,
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:53.060]   including the gut, the heart, the lungs,
[01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:55.000]   and the immune system, and the brain,
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.520]   and that the brain is also controlling these organs
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.940]   so it's a two-way street.
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:02.480]   There's this big myth out there that I mentioned before
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:07.000]   that stimulating the vagus in various ways leads to calmness,
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000]   that it's always going to calm you down.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.640]   And that is false.
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.360]   I just want to repeat, that is completely false.
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.120]   In fact, there was just a paper,
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:16.160]   yet another paper published the other day,
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:17.140]   which is fantastic,
[01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:18.760]   which is from David McCormick's lab
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:20.000]   up at the University of Oregon.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.040]   It's published in Current Biology, excellent journal,
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.060]   showing, I'm just reading the title,
[01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:28.660]   "Vagus nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical,"
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:31.300]   the neocortex, "and behavioral activation."
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:33.220]   I've read the paper, it's fantastic.
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:35.600]   It illustrates, yet again,
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:38.440]   stimulation of the vagus increases dopamine release,
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:42.520]   increases activation of the brain alertness.
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:45.220]   It is a stimulant of alertness.
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:48.300]   It is not calming people down.
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:50.980]   Now, this is interesting in light of emotionality
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:55.640]   because of work that's been done by many groups,
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:57.900]   but in particular, I'm going to focus on the work
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:00.460]   of a colleague of mine, Carl Deisseroth at Stanford,
[01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:03.620]   who's a psychiatrist, but has also developed a lot of tools
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:07.140]   to adjust the activity of neurons in real time
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:10.600]   using light and electrical stimulation and so forth.
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.640]   I'll refer you to an article in "The New Yorker"
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.200]   that was published about this a few years ago.
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:15.920]   I'm going to read a brief excerpt,
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:18.760]   I'll put the link in the caption as well.
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.840]   He's talking to an extremely depressed,
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:23.420]   suicidally depressed patient
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:26.400]   who has a small device implanted
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:29.040]   that allows her to adjust her vagus nerve activity.
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:31.700]   Now, vagus stimulation was originally developed
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:33.340]   for the treatment of epilepsy.
[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:36.400]   It's now being used for various other purposes.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:40.980]   Vagus stimulation can even increase plasticity, it seems.
[01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:43.420]   So again, increasing activity of the vagus
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:46.520]   increases alertness, and it's just incredible
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:49.280]   to see what happens in real time to emotionality
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.180]   when the vagus is stimulated.
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:54.720]   Again, not calming, but activating alertness.
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:57.260]   They're in his office and they're talking
[01:32:57.260 --> 01:32:59.360]   and he asks her how she's doing.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:01.520]   And she describes how she's been doing
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:05.520]   as previously as quote unquote going pancake,
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:08.420]   which for her just means totally laid out flat,
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:10.000]   not much going on.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.060]   She talks about how she doesn't want to pursue a job,
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:14.620]   she's really depressed.
[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:18.980]   And he says in typical good psychiatrist fashion,
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:20.300]   well, that's a lot to think about.
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:21.600]   That's actually the quote.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:26.100]   And they talk about her blood pressure, et cetera.
[01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:30.740]   And then she says mood's been down, just spiraling down,
[01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:33.980]   talks about insomnia, bad dreams, low appetite.
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:35.760]   So this is severe depression.
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.900]   This is what we call major depression.
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:39.200]   And then she requests,
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:43.060]   can we please go up to 1.5 on vagus stimulation?
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:46.700]   She'd been receiving 1.2 milliamps of stimulation
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:48.700]   every five minutes to 30 seconds,
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:50.920]   but was no longer able to feel the effects.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.980]   So he says, okay, I think we can go up a little,
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:54.480]   you're tolerating things well.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:34:00.500]   They start the stimulation and quote,
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:02.680]   in the course of the next few minutes,
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:04.740]   her name was Sally, underwent a remarkable change.
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:07.360]   Her frown disappeared, she became cheerful,
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:08.740]   describing the pleasure she'd had
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:09.780]   during the Christmas holiday
[01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:11.180]   and recounting how she'd recently watched
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:13.220]   some YouTube videos of Diceroth.
[01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:17.680]   She was still smiling and talking when the session ended
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:19.380]   and they walked out to the reception area.
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:21.920]   So this is just by stimulating and activating the vagus.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:23.160]   Now, why am I bringing this up?
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:25.360]   Well, for several reasons.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.640]   One is the vagus is fascinating
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.120]   in terms of the brain-body connection.
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:33.460]   Two, I'd like to keep trying to dispel the myth
[01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:35.940]   that vagus stimulation is all about being calm.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.660]   It's really about being alert.
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:39.780]   I don't know how that originally got going backwards,
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:42.420]   but it's about being alert.
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:44.980]   And once again, level of alertness
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:47.780]   or level of calmness is impacting emotion.
[01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:50.460]   That this access of alertness and calmness
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:54.400]   is one primary access in emotion.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.520]   It's not the only one
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:58.560]   because there's also this valence component of good or bad.
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.380]   And those two aren't the only ones
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:01.620]   because there's also this component
[01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:03.300]   of interoceptive, exteroceptive
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:04.140]   that we talked about earlier.
[01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:05.660]   And there will be others too.
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.180]   Again, it's not exhaustive.
[01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:08.460]   But I find it fascinating
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:11.160]   and it really brings us back to where we started,
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:13.500]   which is what are the core elements of emotion
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.180]   and what can you do about them?
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:17.340]   And before we close up today,
[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:18.500]   I just want to make sure
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.320]   that even though I've mentioned some tools,
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:22.780]   I talked about the Mood Meter app,
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:25.320]   I talked about oxytocin
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.060]   and some of the things that impact oxytocin.
[01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:29.780]   I talked about some of the ways
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:32.300]   that you can conceptualize emotions.
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.660]   This business of how you conceptualize emotions
[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:38.700]   is really the most powerful tool you can ever have
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:41.460]   in terms of understanding and regulating your emotional state
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:44.380]   if you're willing to try and wrap your head around it.
[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:46.740]   I realize it's not the simplest thing to do,
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:48.620]   but rather than think of emotions
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:52.540]   as just these labels, happy, sad, awe, depressed,
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:56.020]   thinking about emotions, excuse me,
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:36:00.820]   as elements of the brain and body
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:02.940]   that encompass levels of alertness,
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:05.540]   that include a dynamic with the outside world
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:07.820]   and your perception of your internal state,
[01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:10.260]   and starting to really think about emotions
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.900]   in a structured way
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:15.420]   can not only allow you to understand some of the pathology
[01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:18.140]   of when you might feel depressed or anxious
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:19.680]   or others are depressed and anxious,
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:22.860]   but also to develop a richer emotional experience
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:23.760]   to anything.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:25.140]   Now, of course, I don't expect that
[01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:27.580]   as you're out there interacting with friends
[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:29.480]   and you're watching TV and experiencing life,
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:32.540]   that you should be parsing every bit of your experience
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:34.820]   in some sort of reductionist and mechanistic way.
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:36.260]   That's not the goal here.
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:38.600]   But for those of you that are practitioners,
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:39.700]   teachers of any kind,
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:40.940]   for those of you that are kids,
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:43.940]   for those of you that are trying to understand
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:46.160]   what your emotional life and your consciousness,
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:49.020]   dare I say the word, really consists of,
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:52.340]   I do believe that these are fundamental elements
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:54.380]   that are well supported by the science
[01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:56.400]   across a variety of researchers
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:59.780]   doing things from a variety of different perspectives
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.460]   and some of whom agree with one another
[01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:03.300]   and some of whom don't.
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:06.900]   So I offer it to you as a source of knowledge
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:10.880]   from which you can start to think about your emotional life
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.660]   differently, I hope, as well as others
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:16.320]   in a way that builds more richness into that experience,
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.460]   not that detracts from it.
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:21.280]   One last point as it relates to that,
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:24.560]   many of you have asked me about psychedelic therapies
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:28.480]   that are now emerging, things like psilocybin and MDMA.
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:32.260]   We are, of course, going to dive into that topic deeply.
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:36.080]   We have an expert guest coming on to discuss that topic.
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:41.080]   Those compounds clearly affect the aspects of emotionality
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.580]   that we were talking about today,
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:47.540]   calmness, alertness, valence, good or bad,
[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:50.820]   interoceptive, exteroceptive positioning.
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:55.360]   And so rather than just do a kind of cursory exploration
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.360]   of those compounds and what the therapeutic
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.940]   and scientific community is thinking about them
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.660]   and how they function, I think it's more important
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:05.280]   to embed that framework in our thinking
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.460]   so that when we address psychedelics
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:09.320]   and we address other sorts of therapies,
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:11.000]   cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.920]   different types of emotive therapies
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:16.460]   that relate to individuals and couples, et cetera,
[01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:18.900]   that we are able to think about them
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:20.940]   with some sort of structure and rigor
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:24.040]   rather than just talk about them as a bunch of chemicals
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:26.520]   that produce these amazing experiences
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:28.080]   that people need to tell you about.
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.780]   Because if there's one truth,
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:32.800]   it seems that psychedelics seem to promote activity
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.200]   of storytelling about psychedelic experience.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:38.700]   But that itself is not really what the therapeutic community
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:41.740]   and the academic communities are interested in.
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:43.880]   They're interested in trying to understand
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:47.660]   the universal truths, the universal biological shifts
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:49.880]   and psychological shifts that occur
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:51.800]   in the clinical use of those compounds.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.520]   And so we're going to hold off for now,
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:54.960]   but we will get to them.
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.000]   Once again, we've covered
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.800]   an enormous amount of material today.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:59.720]   It's really the equivalent of two, if not three,
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:03.580]   university lectures in one podcast episode.
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:05.920]   I want to thank those of you that have supported the podcast
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.580]   and point to ways in which
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:09.360]   all of you can support the podcast.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.440]   Many of these are cost-free.
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:14.040]   The first is to please subscribe on YouTube
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.560]   and as well to hit the notifications button
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:19.080]   so that when we release new videos,
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.840]   which typically is every Monday for the full length episodes,
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:25.000]   but we also know how short clips that you'll be notified.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.700]   As well, if you could subscribe on Apple and Spotify
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:31.720]   and leave us a review on Apple,
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:33.780]   you have the opportunity to leave us a five-star review
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:36.180]   if you think we deserve a five-star review.
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:38.320]   Please tell your friends and family and coworkers
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:40.580]   about the podcast if you think the material
[01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:43.500]   would be of interest and informative for them.
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.840]   And if you want to send them links, that's terrific too.
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:48.760]   We also have a Patreon account.
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:51.840]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:55.280]   And there you can support us at any level that you like.
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.360]   In addition, if you could check out our sponsors,
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:01.000]   we always provide links to those sponsors in the captions.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.760]   That's the best way to support the podcast.
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.280]   And several of you have asked about supplements.
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.640]   I talk about supplements in various episodes.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:09.860]   We've partnered with Thorne
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:12.920]   because we think Thorne has the very highest levels
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:16.400]   of stringency in terms of the purity of the contents
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:18.000]   and the amounts of the contents.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.600]   They really put in the bottle what's listed on the bottle,
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.500]   which is not true for a lot of supplement companies.
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.480]   If you want to see the supplements that I take,
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:27.040]   as well as get a discount on those
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.340]   or any of the other supplements that Thorne makes,
[01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:34.280]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman,
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:37.060]   and you can get 20% off any of those supplements
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:39.080]   or any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:44.080]   So that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:50.880]   to get 20% off any supplements that Thorne makes.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.720]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:54.980]   I want to thank you for your time and attention
[01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:57.280]   and thank you for your interest in science.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:59.860]   (upbeat music)
