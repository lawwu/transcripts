[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   Hello, it's Sam and Sydney from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.780]   And in this episode, we want to talk about fear, the key ingredient necessary for achieving
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.020]   financial independence, and all sorts of other things.
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.080]   So first of all, what do you think?
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.120]   Is fear the key ingredient to achieving everything you want?
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:29.000]   I think it has so much power in terms of motivating us to change and to do more things.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.040]   And when I was in business school, I read this book called Only the Paranoid Survive
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.720]   by Andy Grove.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.000]   He was a former Intel CEO.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.440]   And one of the reasons why I read the book was because we were at the Intel campus down,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.720]   I think it was in Sunnyvale, it was like, 50 minutes south of San Francisco.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.360]   And we were on the campus and I was sitting in there on the campus like from 830, 9am
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.160]   till 5pm on Saturday.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.160]   And I was kind of miserable.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.840]   I was thinking, man, I wish I was doing something else.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.520]   But I was kind of paranoid that I would get let go from my job at Credit Suisse because
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.360]   I just joined two, three years earlier, and we were going through a hangover post dot
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.720]   com bust.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.480]   So there's a great saying last in first out, and I was fearful that I could be next.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:26.680]   So I firmly believe fear and paranoia, two negative words tend to drive us and push us
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.200]   to do better and greater things.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.400]   And for financial independence, when I was growing up in Malaysia, in the Philippines,
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.520]   and also in Zambia, I saw a lot of poverty.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.840]   I didn't see a lot of poverty when I was a baby because I don't remember.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.280]   But I remember clearly in Malaysia, there were those who had and those who had not.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.640]   And one of my friends who worked at a retail watch store, lived in one room with his sister
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.520]   and his parents.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.400]   And when I visited his room, his home, I was really, really shocked because we were living
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.400]   in a nice place.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.720]   It was government housing by the U.S. Embassy.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.200]   And so that really frightened me to not screw up in high school, to try to get as good grades
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   as possible.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.680]   I just I couldn't no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get straight A's, but to try hard
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.800]   in school so that I wouldn't end up in poverty.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.160]   Did you have any fearful moments growing up yourself?
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.240]   I, my parents, my parents both had low income jobs.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.120]   And I know my mom was always complaining about how she didn't get paid enough and how everybody
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.600]   who was coming in for new positions or whatnot were always making more money than her.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.080]   And it was this constant struggle that she had throughout her entire career.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.400]   And my dad also had periods of unemployment in between jobs where he was just looking
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.440]   for work because for whatever reason, he would quit a job and just have all this unhappiness,
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.080]   whether it was due to the people he worked with, or he just wasn't happy with the pay.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.440]   And I knew that I wouldn't be able to count on them as an adult.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.600]   So I knew I needed to educate myself well enough that I'd be able to get a job that
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.480]   I could rely on and make enough money to become financially independent so that I, because
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.120]   I knew I had no safety net to fall back on with my parents.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.920]   It sounds like job security wasn't there for your parents and that must have been stressful.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.740]   What type of work did they do?
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.240]   My dad was a blue collar worker and my mom was basically like an office clerk.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   Right.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.920]   And so was, you know, my mom, although she worked at the foreign service, you know, her
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.220]   dreams, she got, I think, a scholarship to go to Duke university to study science biology,
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.240]   but she gave up those dreams to marry my father who decided to join the foreign service.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.760]   And so that's why actually one of my fears, one of my greatest fears growing up was disappointing
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.840]   my parents because my mom worked so hard and I saw unhappiness in her here and there because
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.840]   I felt like she wasn't pursuing her dreams.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.280]   So I felt, man, if she's not going to pursue her dreams, I better not screw up school so
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:17.060]   I can do better, earn my own money and at least make her and my dad feel proud that
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.200]   all their sacrifices were worth it.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.860]   I've had a similar type of feeling from my parents and, you know, I, especially in terms
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.480]   of college, you know, they had to take out loans and I had to rely on scholarships and
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.640]   they made it very clear to me that they didn't have money to send me to an expensive school.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:46.300]   So I went to state school and I ended up paying half of that myself, which was fantastic because
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.240]   it taught me to, you know, I had skin in the game.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.720]   I had to make the most of my college education because I was paying for half of it and I
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.160]   knew that I couldn't get more help from my parents.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.640]   And did they go to college?
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.400]   No, they did not get a bachelor's degree.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.200]   And so them not getting a college bachelor's degree, did it ever occur to you when you
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.600]   were growing up, "Oh, maybe you shouldn't get one either"?
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   Not really.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.840]   They always encouraged me to do well.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.500]   And I think one of the lessons that they taught me was that one of the reasons they had so
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.300]   many struggles in their career is because they were not formally college educated.
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.080]   So that was something they were determined for me to be able to do.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.120]   So I grew up expecting to go to college, which I'm grateful for.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.280]   Yeah, I actually never, when I grew up, I never thought there was an option not to go
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.880]   to college because my parents, both my parents went to college.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.120]   And only as an adult did I, do I realize only about 35 to 37% of Americans have college
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.780]   degrees, four-year college degrees.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.000]   So I'm living in a bubble, we're living in a bubble, and it's important that I don't
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.560]   live in this bubble forever if I want to reach out to as many people on Financial Samurai
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.640]   and help people learn more about their finances.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.800]   Because although our reality is real, a lot of people say, "Oh, you're living in a bubble,
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.520]   your reality is not real."
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.260]   The reality is whatever reality we experience is our reality.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.680]   It doesn't, just because you don't experience our reality doesn't make our reality less
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.680]   real.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.680]   So you went to college.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.520]   One of the reasons why I went to William & Mary State School was because the tuition was $2,800
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.720]   a year.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.760]   And I knew that if I graduated from college, even if I couldn't get a job, I could always
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.880]   return to my day job making $4 an hour at the time working at McDonald's and pay my
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.060]   parents back.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.960]   Did you have any fear that you would, I don't know, waste four years of your college education?
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.600]   Actually you went for three and a half years, right?
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.520]   Yeah, I graduated early.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.600]   Did you have any fear of not being able to get a job and letting that time and money
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.760]   go to waste?
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.800]   I don't know that I was fearful of not getting a job, but I knew it was going to be competitive.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.760]   And I didn't really enjoy college the way that most people do.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.760]   I wasn't there to party and have fun.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.960]   I was there to get in and get out.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.560]   And that's also why I was able to graduate early.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:26.800]   I was taking a really heavy class load each semester, and then I was just determined to
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.520]   get out and find a job and start working.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.320]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.480]   I was really happy in college.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.680]   I had so much fun in college, study abroad, meeting a lot of people, going to parties.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.200]   It was so fun for me.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.680]   I was really sad to have left after four years.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.680]   I remember taking golf in the last semester.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.480]   I went to play golf like three times a week until my back hurt so much.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.640]   It was kind of fun and crazy.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:58.400]   But I feared wasting my four years in college tuition only to come out working at McDonald's.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.000]   I truly feared that.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.200]   I just remember when I didn't want to study, I would just study my butt off so I could
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.120]   get good grades to give me a chance to get a good job.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.800]   One thing that I thought about when I was trying to decide if I could actually graduate
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:22.480]   early is that I thought if I get out in December, I'm roughly six months ahead of the curve
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.280]   in terms of my class who would be looking for jobs.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.800]   So I would be available to start working as early as January, whereas everybody else in
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.680]   my class wouldn't be able to start working until June, July.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.720]   Strategically, that's really smart.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.280]   So if anybody wants to save money on college and graduate earlier to get a head start,
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.880]   I think that's a wise move.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.360]   Maybe we'll tell our kids.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.600]   Because four years to go to college now that you can learn everything online for free and
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.840]   so quickly to gather information doesn't really make sense.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.200]   I feel like we can graduate two years to do what we did four years ago.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.660]   Not just that, I feel like a lot of kids don't actually graduate in four years.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.760]   A lot of them take five.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.640]   And I think part of the reason why is because they like fear.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:12.960]   They like fear that if they don't graduate sooner, they'll run out of money or their
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.720]   parents will run out of money.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.680]   They don't fear being homeless because their parents will just take them in and live with
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.680]   them.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.440]   I mean, in our neighborhood, we have six guys who are 25 to 35 years old still living with
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.440]   their parents.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:31.760]   They don't have fear of falling down because they've always got their parents to take care
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.360]   of them.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.920]   And so again, I think fear is a great motivator for change.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:43.600]   You know, 2008, 2009 financial crisis, that was very scary for me because I was right
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.720]   front row seat in the financial crisis.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.000]   Lehman Brothers going bankrupt.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.560]   Bear Stearns getting taken under.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.120]   So many rounds of layoffs.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.200]   Friends just getting blown out left and right.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.720]   And I was so fearful that I stopped slacking off and decided to start Financial Samurai
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.720]   in July 2009.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.840]   If I didn't have fear, I wouldn't have started the website because I wouldn't be thinking
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.920]   about, "Oh, what do I need to do next?" or "What kind of safety net should I have just
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.920]   in case I get blown out?"
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.800]   Because I would never feel like I was going to get blown out.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.360]   It's interesting now that there's a lot of tech layoffs due to the overhang post pandemic.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.880]   You're hearing these LinkedIn stories saying, "It's hard not to feel down because I dedicated
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:29.540]   so much of my life and I just feel like a number and I feel 100% disposable."
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.140]   And that's the truth.
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.280]   Every single employee is disposable.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.860]   Yes, you have to build relationships and networks.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.980]   But the reality is you have to fear getting laid off and being jobless or underemployed
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:48.040]   for a while to actually try to work even harder and stay later and network and do all that
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   stuff.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.240]   Because if you have no fears, yeah, you just kind of coast.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.240]   Exactly.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.540]   Speaking of Financial Samurai, so I started in July 2009 at the bottom of the financial
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.240]   crisis.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:05.640]   And one thing that has kept me going, publishing three times a week since 2009 is also fear.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.760]   I publicly told everybody, "This is what I'm going to do."
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.880]   Most people don't remember this because that was just a small audience and the audience
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880]   is much larger.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.680]   But I feared looking like a public failure if I didn't do what I said I was going to
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.680]   do.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:24.880]   I just needed to keep on showing up because if I did, that failure, that fear of failure
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.400]   of running the site into the ground, letting it go stale would be pushed to the side because
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.720]   I would just keep on showing up.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.440]   Besides money and career progression, there's also physical fitness.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.400]   And with physical fitness, it's interesting, supposedly like 65% of Americans are overweight.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.280]   I don't believe that stat here in San Francisco and when I'm traveling in New York, but supposedly
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.600]   it's true.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.900]   But if you're a parent, it's interesting.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:57.240]   No parent wants to die before their kids become independent adults.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.520]   So it would just be a natural, logical conclusion to get in better shape, eat better, exercise
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.720]   more once you become a parent.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.880]   Unfortunately, being a parent sucks up so much time.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:13.040]   So I wonder for you, do you have the fear of living an unhealthier life in the future
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.160]   or not living as long until our kids grow up?
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.600]   As a result, you exercise more or you actually don't exercise much because you don't have
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.600]   that much fear.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.800]   I definitely watch what I eat.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.680]   I pay attention to my health.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.480]   I'm getting physicals regularly at my doctor.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.680]   So I definitely think prioritizing health as a parent is super important.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:45.400]   I can't even imagine the thought of our kids having to grow up without us.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.520]   That's why we have all these contingency plans in place.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.720]   But yeah, if there's something that I can control to reduce that risk, I'm all for it.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.720]   Okay.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:02.320]   Well, do you believe the people who are "not in tip-top shape" actually have the highest
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.560]   self-esteem because they don't care what all the advertisements and magazines and TV models
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.240]   tell them about their weight and what social media says?
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.040]   They have the confidence to be who they are and be comfortable in the skin.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.160]   Whereas conversely, the fittest people, the one who spent, I don't know, three hours a
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.720]   day at the gym trying to get ripped six-pack abs, which you don't really need, might have
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.400]   conversely lower self-esteem.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.400]   What are your thoughts about that?
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.600]   I can see your points.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:33.600]   I also think it is not easy at all to be in super crazy tip-top shape and most people
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.600]   aren't that dedicated enough to spend hours and hours in the gym.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.000]   And losing weight is hard.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.240]   It's not easy.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   It's not easy.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.240]   And you know what?
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.960]   We all feel better when we look better, we feel better.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:51.040]   So there is definitely a point to being in shape because your confidence naturally grows.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.440]   But I still believe, you know, if you're comfortable with the way you are, you know, you're not
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.200]   looking like a male model or a female model, I would say that you have great self-esteem
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.800]   and you don't fear judgment.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.280]   You don't fear society's judgment of you.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.800]   And I think that's wonderful.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.940]   And man, I think that's awesome to not have to go to the gym for an hour a day or every
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.800]   other day and have to run three miles because I certainly don't want to do that.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.000]   And so I think I don't fear judgment of the way I look.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.480]   I'm happy with the way I look.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.800]   And as a result, I don't have four-pack or six-pack abs.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.320]   I'm just kind of a regular person.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.600]   But you also exercise way more than I would say the average person does.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.320]   You're very physically active.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.080]   I'm physically active because I enjoy sports.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.040]   I have fun in the community.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.960]   I'm not being physically active to try to, you know, get into brands.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.160]   It's something you love to do.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.960]   Yeah, I just love to do it.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.000]   And it's really hard to lose weight at my age, but whatever.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.120]   I just am physically active because I enjoy sports.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.520]   Yeah, which is great.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:56.480]   So in conclusion, I think that comfort may be our greatest enemy for achieving financial
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.800]   independence.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.600]   Let's say your parents are rich.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.800]   They buy you a car.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.320]   They send you to private school.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:07.020]   You go to, you know, your Asian or European international vacations during the summers
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.020]   and winters.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:13.920]   They then pay your credit card bills and they put the 20% down payment on a $1.5 million
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.840]   property in New York City.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.280]   Are you really going to be that motivated?
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.640]   I say no.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.780]   I say you have no fear of financial failure.
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:28.400]   As a result, you're largely not going to grind as hard, network as hard, work as hard to
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.200]   build your own wealth.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.840]   I totally agree with that.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.040]   And let's say you're born good looking.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.080]   As a result, everybody treats you much nicer.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.120]   They welcome you to the parties.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.840]   They, you know, reach out and see if you need some help.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.840]   They buy you lunch, dinner, whatever it is.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:50.160]   Because you're so good looking, maybe you won't work on your personality because you
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.320]   don't have to because you get all these free passes.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.600]   But eventually your looks will fade.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.940]   And if they fade to the point where you're no longer very attractive, you might start
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.040]   questioning yourself and wondering what's wrong with me because people aren't treating
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.560]   me as nicely as they had in the past.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:13.880]   Now let's say you're given things based on your identity, not based on merit and hard
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.880]   work.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.960]   You know, you're an Asian American person from Guam.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.600]   Therefore you get a free ride and you get a free job and all that stuff.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.160]   Just for example, you start cruising because you believe society will always give you a
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.480]   helping hand.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:32.800]   But then one day the gatekeepers, the elites who decide things might decide you and your
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.680]   people are no longer worthy of special favors.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:41.880]   When that time comes, you might struggle to compete based on your skills alone.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:46.800]   But maybe more importantly, your children might struggle to compete based on their skills
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.060]   alone because they didn't get all those benefits as you got.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.920]   They have to go struggle by themselves.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.780]   So I hope we all have a healthy dose of fear.
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:04.800]   Not so much fear that it debilitates us to paralysis, to inaction, but enough fear where
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.340]   we're just agitated enough to positively change our ways.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:14.560]   It's interesting because at 45 years old now, I've become less fearful of failure because
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.000]   I feel so much.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.820]   Academics, work and society fears are behind me now.
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:26.200]   It feels great not to be beholden to anyone, to be able to speak my mind, tell it as it
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.200]   is.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.000]   If someone comes for me, I'm going to come for them right back.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   It doesn't matter.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.760]   I don't have any like, "Oh, I got to go to the boss's office."
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.440]   "I got to go to the Monday morning because of what I did to someone."
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.640]   That feels so great.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.720]   So my main fear now is not being a good enough father.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.700]   Even though a parent can only do so much to teach their children right from wrong, I still
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.920]   worry how they'll turn out.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:56.640]   Because you see all these people in society, murderers, rapists, thieves.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.900]   It's just like, "What happened?
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.360]   Did all their parents treat them poorly?"
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.360]   I bet not.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.600]   I bet some of them had really loving parents.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.880]   Possibly, but there has to be something else going on.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.080]   And it's probably something like mental illness or substance abuse.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.160]   There's just so many variables.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:20.440]   There's so many variables, which is why I think we need to have empathy for these people,
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:25.720]   but also be aware that, man, we can only control and do so much as parents.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:31.160]   And I guess at 18 or whenever they leave the house, fingers crossed, they become productive
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.640]   members of society who are kind and helpful to others.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:41.160]   And so that's my biggest fear, raising two kids, two wonderful kids now, who grow up
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.680]   being spoiled, entitled, arrogant.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.440]   That is really a huge fear.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:53.400]   And I plan to do as much as possible over the next 13 years or 15 years that they're
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.480]   going to be at home to teach them how to be good people.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Seriously.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   All right, folks.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.920]   I'd love to hear from you whether you think fear is the main ingredient for achieving
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:11.640]   financial independence and whether fear is the main ingredient for helping you stay in
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:17.360]   shape, keep in touch with your parents, be nice so you're not lonely, and so many other
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.680]   things.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.160]   If you love this episode, we'd appreciate a positive five-star review.
