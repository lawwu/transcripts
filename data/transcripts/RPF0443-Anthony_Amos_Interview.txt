[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.680]   My guest today is Anthony Amos.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.200]   Anthony, where in the world are you right now?
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.000]   Mate, we're actually in Florida as we speak.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.760]   Ah, you're near me.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.760]   Tampa, Florida, mate.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.800]   Yes, I can just see you just down the road from me.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.880]   If you come over to the east coast of West Palm Beach, let me know after this so we can
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.120]   arrange and so I can connect with you while you're here.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.360]   But you are in the middle of a giant trip around the United States.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.440]   You and your family are from Australia.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.160]   You're traveling all around the United States, all 50 states and some twice over.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.600]   Tell us what you're doing and tell us about the scope of the trip and then we're going
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.680]   to get into how you made this thing happen.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.680]   Alrighty.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.760]   So here's the, what you call the elevator pitch, I guess the Americans say over here.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.440]   We are family of five, 13, 12 and 11 of the kids, girl boy, girl, beautiful wife, a little
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.840]   rescue dog and three rabbits.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.320]   We have a 63 foot train, which is a 41 foot RV and a big blue dog on the back.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.760]   And the big blue dog is a grooming salon that I brought over from Australia, which I'll
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.060]   get into in a minute.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.060]   We are traveling the country, 50 states, over 150 cities, washing dogs at shelters and events
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.580]   and raising awareness for animal adoption and animal rescue.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.320]   We want to raise a million dollars and we want to save as many dogs as we can.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.280]   And we're talking in the thousands.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.400]   So for the next 12 months, starting in April, we're doing our last leg of the tour.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.560]   We've been going a little bit over the six months, finding our feet in the marketplace.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.360]   And now that we're got our strategic partners, our sponsors, we are ready to hit the ground
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.640]   running on the 30th of April in L.A. with a Larry King red carpet event with all the
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.360]   celebrities that have got rescue dogs.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.240]   So we're getting ready to pound the pavement, my friend.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.720]   And so from that date, the 30th of April, at that point, you're going to go and you're
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.680]   going to do all 50 states over the following 12 months?
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.680]   Exactly.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.400]   And we've nearly done 30 already.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.160]   So we're going to be doubling back over more than half to to accomplish our goal.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160]   Really incredible.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.680]   So you in your story, you bring together a lot of things that my listeners and I really
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.200]   love to hear about.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.800]   You know, you're a businessman, a very successful businessman.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.980]   You're doing this with your family.
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.520]   Your children are at a beautiful age to build family member family memories together.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.240]   They're all involved in the work that you're doing.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.800]   And you're not only having a giant adventure, you're doing it in a way that's in a subject
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.560]   that's very, very meaningful to you.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.560]   So this is a perfect fit for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.840]   What's your backstory?
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.720]   How did how did you come?
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.160]   You know, what was what was the path through business and how did you come to to hatch
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   this idea?
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.640]   Well, let's just sort of go back to too early.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.020]   So out of high school, I played football, which is my rugby league back in Australia.
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.640]   You guys call it rugby.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.920]   I started at the age of five, finished the age of 30, retired when I was 30.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.200]   But I had two professional years in there.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.520]   I straight out of high school.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.000]   I played professional football at 19 and 20.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.340]   And in the offseason, when they had off seasons back then, I was really interested in wanting
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.640]   to do something on my own.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.800]   I think the biggest thing with entrepreneurs is when you find it difficult to be told what
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   to do.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.480]   Now, there's a big difference been being told what to do and being coachable.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.360]   People are coachable that are in turn respected the right way and valued the right way.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.200]   But when you've been told what to do, like a dictatorship, entrepreneurs arc up about
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   that.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.040]   Now, some people are vocal about it and others just say, screw you all.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.000]   I'll get back in my own way.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.400]   So my biggest issue was I love the game so much.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.320]   It was in my veins, but I just really struggled being told what to do with these particular
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.360]   trainers and coaches.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.360]   So in the offseason, I had a garden trowel in my backyard and my brother and I went and
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.080]   bought a hydro bath, which is a dog sort of bath that you put in that you put dogs in.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.360]   So when we went and bought one for $1,400 stuck in the back of the garden trailer, put
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.960]   an ad in the paper, rented a mobile phone and charged $10 to wash people's dogs.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.440]   And that's pretty much how the business model for me of hydro dog actually started.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.120]   So after a year or so, we hit the market right at the right time.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.520]   People getting their dogs washed was unheard of in Australia.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.920]   You just hit the old stories.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.120]   Ah, she'll be right, mate.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.720]   I'll just throw the dog in the dam.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.720]   Now he swims in the pool.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.280]   He doesn't need a wash.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.920]   So we had to sort of break that barrier and we did.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.680]   And in a very short period of time, we had five employees plus my round and my brother's
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.280]   round and we were killing it.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.980]   What happened though was over a short period of time, once we got to those seven trailers
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.160]   on the road, it'd rain and the operators wouldn't get out of bed and go and work.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.400]   They'd get drunk on Friday night.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.440]   They wouldn't turn up on Saturday because they were hung over.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.600]   One of the girls got pregnant.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.560]   She literally walked away from a huge round because obviously the bub comes first and
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.800]   sort of the business.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.160]   So we got ourselves into a little bit of trouble with these employees attitude and we realized
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.200]   that you have to have skin in the game in this particular industry.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.640]   So long and short of it, we franchised the business and this is actually a very, very
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.920]   cool story for your listeners out there of what can really drive you in some circumstances.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.660]   We had a goal once we reached a hundred operators.
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.520]   This is before we franchised, but we got to a hundred franchises in a very, very short
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.960]   period of time.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.600]   And our goal was to fly to Geneva to buy Rolex and to celebrate the fact that we got a hundred
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.600]   operators on the road.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.800]   So my motive, my motivation, this is a true story and a lot of people will relate to this.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.160]   My motivation wasn't getting a hundred or making all the money.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.440]   My motivation was going to Geneva and buying that Rolex.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.000]   So my, you know, why, if you like was a bloody watch, but it was more than the watch.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.200]   It was achieving something that was so far out of our reach, you know, coming out of
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   the football world and, you know, getting in and getting our hands dirty.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:45.560]   You can imagine a big bike like me, 250 pounds playing rugby and then, you know, going out
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.560]   and watching dogs.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.800]   So we just obviously didn't care what people think.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.760]   And we built a huge empire and was very, very successful.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.840]   So we built, then bought the big blue dog out.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.000]   I said to my brother one day, I said, look, I don't want to do this anymore.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.360]   It's like I hit my goal, mate.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.840]   I hit the hundred, got my watch and I thought, you know, I don't want to do this anymore
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.760]   because I was the one dealing with all the personalities with the franchisees and God
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.760]   bless them.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.760]   I love them.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.120]   It just got a lot, a lot of work.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.000]   So my brother said, look, we're living too much money.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.200]   We've got to be able to do something.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   So we turned it into a master franchise, which meant we sold all the states and territories
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.720]   in Australia, which is only seven in comparison to your 50.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.440]   We did that within 18 months.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.560]   And now all these seven were looking after all our franchisees.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.680]   It was the perfect model for me.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.400]   I'm now talking to sophisticated entrepreneurs that are bought into our idea, that are loving
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   what they're doing.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.520]   And we just grew rapidly.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.400]   So again, after two years, my interest again, but that's what entrepreneurs do, mate.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.920]   They get to a certain level that you bust the glass ceiling.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.920]   There's nowhere else to go.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.920]   So what do you do?
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.080]   We sell the business.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.840]   We sold the business, mate, right before the financial crisis, the world financial crisis
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.840]   took over.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.120]   Perfect, perfect timing.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.280]   However, we got into property development.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.280]   What do you do when you make a ton of money?
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.400]   Go and lose it by investing in things you have no experience in.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.440]   That's what everybody does.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.080]   When you get a ton of money, what do you do?
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.400]   You go and become a property developer.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:21.120]   So the biggest lesson I learned, and I'm talking big.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.840]   We're talking Ramada Resort on the North Queensland, the most beautiful water you've ever seen.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.620]   It's a $100 million build.
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.800]   And we're really, really excited.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:36.060]   But when the crisis flipped, we actually had an American company that was funding the build.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.640]   So we couldn't pull the money out.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.600]   We couldn't roll the money over.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.120]   Therefore the development fell over.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.960]   So my beautiful wife, God bless her, she said, let's go to America.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.520]   You know, Hydroxy, this is the lesson for the listeners.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:54.640]   I knew franchising and the grooming pet mobile industry like the back of my hand.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.640]   I could have done a blindfold.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.600]   I actually washed dogs myself for six years.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:05.080]   So what that does, mate, it gives you the inside information to your business model,
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:12.800]   which is ground level work, hands on the tools, understanding the business principles, working
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   with the clients.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.240]   So when franchisees bought off me, I was doing what they were about to do.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.440]   So that's why they really embraced the business model.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.320]   Then when we became a master, we still had a master area.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.280]   So we would just like the masters.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.780]   And then, you know, then we sold it.
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.680]   So my wife's like, you know, this back to front, we didn't know property development.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.160]   We got project managers, but we didn't know it.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.960]   It was a little bit arrogant, to be honest with you.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.000]   When you think about it, you get a sign of money, you jump into something, you know nothing
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   about.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And that was a really big lesson.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.600]   So came to America, brought over the big blue dog.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.960]   I found the manufacturers.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.760]   I found my business partners and we got up and running.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.340]   Got some really great business partners with some big capital and big things were happening.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.600]   So it took us a year to franchise the business.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.240]   And America is very, very different to Australia.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.920]   Australia's got one franchise agreement that covers the whole country.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:06.680]   You guys have something like, you know, 11 states are the same and the rest of them are
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.120]   individual franchise documents.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.540]   So it's a minefield over here, completely different.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.200]   So bring these guys together.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.640]   And after about a year of piecing it together, mate, I went back to Australia for a funeral.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.440]   And when I got back, the guy said, look, we've gone through this, but leaving too much money
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.560]   on the table.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.560]   We want to corporatize.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.040]   I went, no, you can't corporatize.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.200]   I've told you if you don't have skin in the game, it's not going to work.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.640]   So the long and short of it, a year and a half later, we had a buyout, by the way, and
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.880]   I started two other companies of my own and invested in a few others.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.600]   And, you know, things are really good.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.400]   And still to this day, I have those businesses, which are great.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.640]   And that's a lot of those have helped with the tour, which I'll talk about in a minute.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.360]   Anyway, so a year and a half later, they ring up and said, look, you're right.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.360]   We're going to liquidation.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360]   Do you want to buy the company back?
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.800]   Now, Joshua, I've got to tell you this.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.880]   Outside of marrying my beautiful wife and having my three kids, that is number five
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.880]   on the table.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.080]   It's one of the most exciting, exhilarating moments of my life.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.360]   And as far as business goes, the number one and best thing that's ever happened to me
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.360]   in business.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.600]   When you get back your company, you know, for pennies on the dollar after starting it
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.400]   for nothing when you when I was the age of 21, it just there was something magical about
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   it.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.600]   So I get the company back and we start to work out what's the program now of how do
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.440]   we build this brand across the country?
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.280]   Now, to the kids credit, they were watching the Humane Society.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.760]   I do know those edgy guys have got here, the tea jerkers with the celebrities talking about
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.120]   how bad it is.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.520]   So anyway, the kids were just at the right age to really be impacted by this.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.920]   And I went back to my beautiful wife and said, what can we do now?
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.540]   We've got HydroDog back.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.420]   So in the middle of the night, Rachel wakes me up and I've got to be honest with you,
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.340]   I thought I was getting lucky, but no, she said, let's get a 40 foot RV.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.220]   So I sort of lost and I sort of won at the same time.
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.220]   And we then strategize and thought, OK, well, what does this look like?
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:07.260]   So we literally put the big blue dog, which is on a transit van here in America, in Australia,
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.740]   they're all on trailers.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.500]   So we converted it to a transit van so we could tow it.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.660]   Now that's the model, which is just fantastic.
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.980]   No one has to tow anything anymore.
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.380]   It's just a big transit van, Ford transit van with a big blue dog on the back.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.420]   And if the listeners jump on the website, they can they can see what it looks like.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.860]   It's just it's incredible, very impacting, mind you.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.220]   So anyway, we put the dog on the back and we commit to a year and a half because we
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:36.740]   just know that we've got to really sort of find out what the marketplace is like and
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.200]   we want to raise a million dollars.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.060]   So I'll tell you this, this is a really good example.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:46.980]   I've been in the pet industry for 20 years and I haven't been in the rescue industry.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:52.160]   I was very naive thinking that there was a crossover and there wasn't.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.220]   The rescue world and adoption world is a completely different beast.
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.180]   It's political organizations are fighting against each other.
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.380]   You've really got to get your right medium with the right people.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.060]   In the moment that we became partners with the greater good dot org and dot com, that
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.100]   really changed everything, because now we know who are the right people, the right people's
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.260]   intentions and, you know, it's a doggy doggy world out there.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.460]   I'm telling you, it's it's a really tough environment.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.980]   So now we've got that in place.
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.160]   Then we've got wild pets that come on to support a strategic partners.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.660]   And now we've got all these incredible sponsors that have come on board that you can see on
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.700]   the side of the bus and see in the right up when you jump on the website, which is just
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.300]   really, really amazing.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:38.900]   So anyway, we get on this journey, 50 states, you know, over 150 cities and we get on the
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:44.260]   road and I'm telling you about the trials and tribulations of just trying to find our
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.260]   feet.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.260]   We were chasing the media.
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.740]   I tell you one thing about social media today.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.700]   You remember the old saying, build it and they will come.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.460]   That was that was Rome, right?
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.260]   I know firsthand that that does not exist anymore.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.900]   Social media was our nemesis.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.100]   Everyone loved what we were doing.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.780]   Can you imagine five Australians in a big RV traveling around the country with a big
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.780]   blue dog?
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.940]   It's never been done before in the history of America.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.940]   Yeah.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.940]   How exciting.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.220]   So everyone's on board, but no one wants to commit because we've got 300 followers on social
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.220]   media.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.220]   Right.
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:23.420]   And what we should have done is we should have built the story before we built the actual
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.700]   adventure itself.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.900]   So people could get behind and do some social media posts and get people interested enough
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.020]   to see when when's a launch going to happen?
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.260]   How's it going to work?
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.260]   But we did it the hard way.
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.380]   But you know, when I look back and I think about us pounding the pavement like we did,
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.780]   we chased all the Fox Morning crews.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.940]   They'd come out and they do their little interviews with us and it ended up giving us some great
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.940]   exposure.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.100]   But that's when the greater good have gone.
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.380]   Look at the commitment that these guys are doing.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.740]   They're driving all across the country.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:54.540]   I mean, we drove from Vegas to Knoxville within thirty three hours to get to an event and
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.620]   made it by forty five minutes.
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.980]   And these people look at these guys.
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.900]   You know, they're really making a big difference by, you know, getting out there and putting
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.820]   everything on the line to get to these media.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:10.260]   So now we don't have that people coming to us now about the events and having this what
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:15.640]   we're calling our our launch, if you like, in L.A. with Larry King.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.300]   We did a great interview with Larry King up in North Carolina.
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.060]   It was such a wonderful experience.
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.340]   We had Larry King in our RV interviewing the family.
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.340]   Right.
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.620]   Can you can you imagine like growing up as a kid?
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.500]   We first interviewed Roosevelt like the first president.
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.620]   He's interviewed every president since Roosevelt.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.540]   And Larry King is in our RV interviewing us about our expedition over the next year and
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.540]   a half.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.020]   Now, I've got to tell you, mate, that that was one of those things that I can say to
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:48.020]   the kids and my wife is we've done something that's so impacting from a from a guy like
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.020]   that.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:54.580]   So with that, his business partner, Philip, who's a great guy, working together on a reality
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:59.940]   show and doing this red carpet event that's going to unfold on the 30th of April in L.A.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.460]   and bringing all the celebrities with their dogs and, you know, adoption and rescue and
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.100]   all that sort of stuff.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.100]   And that's when we're going to do our launch from that day for 12 months.
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.480]   And then we'll just branch out and do the 50 states and get ourselves around the country.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:19.940]   So we're really now created a wonderful platform to have a bigger impact than than initially
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.940]   thought.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.220]   That is an incredible story.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.900]   And what I love about it is especially with regard to my audience, it brings together
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:32.060]   your own personal focus, your own personal business and your work there to help build
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.060]   your business.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:37.060]   Because am I understanding you correctly that you're still running your businesses, all
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.300]   of them from the road while you do this adventure?
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.300]   I do.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.380]   And what's happened since then is this.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.900]   Let me tell you how committed I am to the to the 12 months that's coming up.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.700]   I've jumped back into some of the ones that are very time consuming.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.340]   I've got my partners to step up and take them to the forefront.
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.540]   And I said, give me 12 months.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:02.740]   I've got to be totally dedicated to this tour and everything will overflow from the exposure
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.740]   from that.
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.860]   I mean, we get this reality show that becomes a reality.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.400]   That's a game changer that that turns everything into, you know, our opportunity of raising
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.540]   the money and getting some great exposure for the businesses will just go through the
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.540]   roof.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.340]   So I've said to the guys, I really want to make this a focus.
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.380]   This is what I learned in the early days.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:26.280]   If you have one business that you're really, really good at and you give it everything
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.280]   you've got.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:33.220]   And I remember I remember a statement where someone said, if you had five seedlings and
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.700]   one bucket of water and you fed them each day, they would grow to a certain height.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.820]   But if you had one seedling with one bucket of water, that seedling would end up being
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.280]   five times the size of the trees in comparison.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.820]   So HydroDog was the only thing I had for 10 years.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.820]   I just gave it everything I got.
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.980]   We made a lot of money and again, but then we went into property, which is still on this
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.860]   same example.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.860]   But I didn't divert from what I knew.
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.720]   Then coming over here into the US and getting the buyout that I did, I went into all these
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.960]   other businesses because I'd already got to that level.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:09.300]   So now I'm wise enough, if you like, and I'm able to use the partnerships and leverage
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.220]   and all the all the wonderful lessons I've learned all the way.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.320]   I was in a position to be able to do that.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.500]   But now fast forward it to the tour.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:21.140]   I have to give it everything that I've got now and everything else just has to take a
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.020]   little back seat because I know the value in having that one water can with that one
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.020]   seed.
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.860]   Now, the commitment that I've actually given, I'm an Australian.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.860]   I love to have a drink one day a week after working Monday to Friday, my bum off.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.940]   I would then have a drink on Friday or Saturday and really give it some, really have a big
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:42.060]   night and, you know, get on the piss as we would say in Australia.
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:47.760]   I've given that up for 12 months deliberately so I can have seven days a week focus on on
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.760]   the tour itself.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.320]   A, it takes the drinking day away and B, it takes the hangover away.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:56.400]   So I'm now fully focused 100 percent seven days a week with the family.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.780]   And I think that's a really good example that I'm showing not just to the family, but to
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.940]   also the business people that are involved in what we're doing.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.780]   And that is you've got one crack at this.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.980]   You've got 12 months from April to really make haywire the sun shines and sacrifice
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:15.140]   everything else and put it into perspective and not look at all the other businesses and
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:20.820]   just really concentrate on this tour because the overflow from this might will be hydro
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.820]   dog will come out of the gates.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.340]   We'll be selling these franchises across the country where we have developed relationships
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:31.960]   with the shelters, the events that we've dovetailed into and also created.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.260]   And when we finished the tour, we didn't want it to finish.
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:41.420]   And the legacy of the Bay of the Saved Tour is we've created such a noticeable mark on
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.980]   this planet that people will start thinking about adoption.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.380]   It will start thinking about animal rescue.
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:52.940]   Now, hydro dog will come into each one of those areas and then back up what we're doing
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.540]   and had that franchise in that area with the relationships that we've created.
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.420]   So think about this for a number.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.980]   There's 200 of these big blue dogs in Australia.
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.500]   Let's just say there was 200 of them here in America and each one of those blue dogs
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.940]   say one dog a life once a month.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:15.060]   That's 200 dogs we'd be saving every month here in the US at an absolute minimum for
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.060]   ever.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:21.180]   So the Bay of the Saved Tour might finish in 12 months, but the hydro dog will create
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.820]   the Bay of the Saved legacy forever while that franchise is alive.
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.740]   How cool is that that we can do that ongoing once this tour finishes?
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.740]   Absolutely.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:35.460]   And what's awesome about the story is not only with your personal example with the children
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.380]   of saying, "Okay, I'm giving up alcohol so I can be fully focused," which does set a
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.540]   great example.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.260]   In addition to that, they're fully involved in the work of this.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.180]   That was one thing I was so happy to see when I met you.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.140]   I was at a podcasting conference and I didn't meet you first.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.140]   I met your children.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:56.700]   I met your younger two, which were 12 and 11 year old.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.820]   I met your 12 and your 11 year old first, and here they are at a table full of adults
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.580]   telling the adults what they're doing and telling them about their project.
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.740]   So you've created an incredible opportunity to really engage with them, teach them business
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.080]   skills, teach them marketing skills, involve them in every step and to do it in a very
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.700]   family integrated way, which I love.
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.020]   Well I'm so glad you brought that up because this is the bottom line.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.520]   They're not along for the free ride.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.540]   These kids are part of the ecosystem and what they bring to the table are elements, and
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:33.260]   I'm not exaggerating when I say this, are elements that my wife and I couldn't do with
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.180]   everything that we've got going on with creating this tour because there are so many moving
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:42.100]   parts, but what they contribute and how hard they work, plus they've got school on top
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.340]   of that.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.780]   This is another great part of the story.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.940]   They do what's called School of the Air back to Australia, which is a curriculum for the
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.940]   kids in the outback that can't actually get to a school.
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:56.460]   So they're learning the Australian curriculum and they have a couple of tutors here in the
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.580]   US to make sure they stay on track with that.
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:03.620]   But listen, on top of that, the way that they get to the events, they wash the dogs, they
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:08.060]   communicate with the customer, they text them when the dog, it's time for their bath, they
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.500]   take the money, they have the conversations, and then there's the cleaning up of the RV
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.380]   and setting up of the RV and the dog.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:19.100]   And then my son Austin, he's only 12 and he'll take the big blue dog off the back and maneuver
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.940]   it around so I can actually move the bus around and everybody's in this together.
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.820]   I think what they're learning is work ethic.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:30.700]   They're also learning what it's like to be an entrepreneur because there's so many variables
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.780]   at the end of the day that goes wrong.
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:39.940]   We have some pretty awesome times, but it gets stressful having a small family, the
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.740]   200 square foot home.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:47.220]   I'm telling you, there are days where we want to kill each other, but what we're doing overrides
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.180]   the days because everybody has their challenging days.
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.580]   And it's how you look at those challenges that makes the difference for us to say, "All
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.540]   right, what are we going to do to make that little bit better or make it work?"
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:02.940]   But for them to understand how to minimize, work out what we really have to have as a
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:08.620]   bare minimum to make all this work as far as clothes and the kids aren't playing sports,
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.820]   they're not around their normal friends.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.780]   They're sacrificing a lot as well, but I think one of the biggest things I know that my wife
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.820]   and I are contributing to this is an example when I was up in North Carolina, there was
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:25.820]   a guy actually working in the restaurant and I love telling the story so people can follow
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.580]   us with what we're doing.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.140]   And he said, "Well, where's your favorite place?"
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.140]   I said, "Oregon."
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.140]   He said, "Where?"
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.140]   I said, "Pacific."
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.660]   And he finished my sentence and he said, "City."
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.660]   I went, "Yes."
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:40.180]   He's a 50 year old bloke that turned into a 10 year old how passionate he was about
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.540]   growing up in Oregon with his grandparents.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.260]   And he explained everything that was there that I had just gone through, running up the
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.740]   dunes and being on the restaurants on the beach and having a fire on the beach.
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:50.900]   It was just incredible.
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.180]   And then a light globe went off in my head.
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.580]   These kids are going to go to the minimum of every single state in the country.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.700]   They're going to go to hundreds of cities and they're literally going to go through
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.940]   towns and places that some of the average Americans won't even go to.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:08.140]   Now when they get older and they hear an American accent anywhere in the world, they're going
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.300]   to be able to go up to them and say, "Where are you from?"
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.620]   They're instantly going to have rapport and a conversation with somebody.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.980]   Now you think of the value of that when you're growing up and you're at a dinner table or
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:22.500]   you're at a bar or you're somewhere magical and you hear that accent and you know that
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.740]   you've got information that can create a conversation.
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.740]   I think that's a really valuable tool.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:27.740]   - Yeah, it's huge.
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.060]   Man, I can't wait to, I want to talk to you in a year and hear how they've changed.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:38.260]   But six months in, what changes have you seen in them over the last six months so far?
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.060]   - I think it's their maturity level.
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.620]   I mean, they're little adults.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.500]   I'm probably the most immature out of all of them, to be honest with you.
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.660]   They've really got their shit together.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:53.780]   They know how to really talk on a personal level with people.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.780]   They're very engaging.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.780]   They're very respectful.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.700]   They're not afraid to talk in front of the camera.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.980]   They know their information that they can deliver.
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:06.140]   They've become very compassionate with the circumstances that we've been involved in
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:10.620]   because even though we're doing a great thing in saving lives, there are times where little
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.900]   dogs don't get saved while we're there and the kids get heartbroken about that because
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.540]   they want to save every single dog that we see.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.860]   So there's a lot of that emotional content that they've had to harden as well.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:26.620]   And I think when you see five dogs and three dogs get rescued and there's two that are
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.500]   left behind, and sometimes we don't know whether they do or whether they don't, they get in
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.420]   the bus and they have a little bit of a cry to themselves.
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:37.700]   And going through that process is, I think, giving them a wonderful tool of understanding
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.580]   the levels of emotion and how you can't save every dog, but you've still got to remember
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.100]   you're doing something that's great.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.740]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:51.740]   With regard to the finances of the trip, I want to hear as much or as little as you want
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.740]   to share.
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.740]   Respect your right to privacy.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:59.700]   But you're doing this in a way that I think is so remarkable in that you're seeking to
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:04.180]   raise a million dollars and I assume is that going to be donated to charities or I'd love
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.580]   to hear what you're going to do with that.
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:10.460]   You're also using this as a foundation for personal marketing of the business.
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:15.380]   There's a huge potential opportunity there, but this is obviously a lot of money to get
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.820]   this rig set up and a lot of personal investment.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.580]   How did you arrange the finances of this?
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:27.500]   Well, I think when you look at the million dollars that's getting raised now, that's
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:34.340]   money that is all in donations and that people actually put back through the Greater Good.
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:41.140]   So the greatergood.org is our 5013C and everything that we make from the raising of the money
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:49.060]   at the event, washing the dogs and online adoption programs that they do all goes back
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.660]   to them and that's the money that's going to tick over the counter for.
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.700]   And just real quick, I want to clarify, you guys come into a town, you set up a big event
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:02.940]   that you publicize locally, you bring people in, they pay to have their dogs washed by
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.340]   volunteers and by your children and you and then that money is what's being donated to
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.340]   greatergood.org?
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.340]   Yep, 100% of that money goes back to them.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.580]   But also before we get to that event, the greatergood.org will go out and put out a
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.300]   program of people to donate when we get to that particular town.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:24.540]   So with the customization of Facebook and other avenues where they can target people
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.900]   who live in those areas, they then come online and they donate $5, $10, $20 and before you
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.020]   know it, it's in the thousands.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.420]   So that's a combination of that in both.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.900]   Now the second component is for the tour.
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:41.660]   100% of the money that's done that goes through our e-commerce and anything related to that
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.380]   goes towards the tour itself, which is the fuel and the accommodation.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.740]   Everything you can imagine, we've built up this e-commerce now with a great platform
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.980]   that all of those fundings, 100% of that goes towards the tour.
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:59.420]   But up until now, we've been completely self-funding the whole process.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.780]   I mean, we've got some business partners in as well that have wanted to get a bit of equity
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:09.420]   in the game, but we've also pretty much financed through other companies the whole thing right
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.420]   until now.
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.900]   But now it's time to turn it into, look, we've tested and measured the marketplace.
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:19.340]   Now we've got people that can come in and be confident, especially the sponsors, of
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:24.220]   getting a return on investment with national exposure and social media marketing and all
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.220]   that sort of thing.
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.900]   We've really ironed out all the bugs for people to come in and to take great advantage, especially
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:34.460]   if we get on this reality show and the Larry King event and what have you.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.220]   They're going to get some incredible national coverage.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:41.620]   So we've got a handful of sponsors left that I want to tie up before the 30th of April
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.620]   and that'll just solidify.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.300]   And I don't have to worry about it after that.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.980]   We can just get on with the business and create some real magic.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:52.540]   As a business person, I'd like you to talk to the process of getting sponsors because
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:58.100]   this is something I think many people could use, especially if people maybe don't have
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:02.900]   as much money as they'd say, "I'd love to take 18 months and travel around with my children
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.460]   all around the United States."
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.260]   People could use it, but it's a business.
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.380]   You've got to put up first.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.240]   You've got to be able to get exposure for a potential sponsor.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:16.740]   And so if you can take a skill set that is a real skill, like marketing, building a platform,
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:23.220]   attracting attention, and you can monetize that skill set through sponsors with an epic
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:28.220]   adventure like this, but you've got to recognize that you've got to bring huge value to the
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.220]   sponsors.
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.100]   As an entrepreneur, talk about that process since you're right in the middle of it and
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.740]   teach my audience how they can go and do something similar.
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:41.740]   Well, the example I use before I'll go into more detail is that when we started with 200
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:47.100]   followers, I thought if we get five or six sponsors to completely fund this, we'll be
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.200]   on our way.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.380]   But no one did because no one saw any effort put in.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.740]   We just came up with an idea, wrapped a big bus and said, "All right, let's go come on
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.700]   board and get some national coverage."
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.700]   It didn't work like that.
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:03.020]   We made, I promise you when I say this, it's going to almost look like this is a made up
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.020]   story.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:09.220]   When I told you we went from Vegas to Knoxville for that one event, we then drove from Knoxville
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:16.580]   to New York for one event, we then drove from New York to LA for one event.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.740]   That's what, a thousand bucks of fuel?
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:22.740]   Mate, I'm telling you, but the thing was I reckon I'm the only person that can drink
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.020]   a five-hour energy drink and get 10 hours out of it.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:30.240]   I absolutely pounded the pavement because we were following the media.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.180]   We were getting on the Fox morning shows where they did live segments with us.
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.500]   We'd turn up there at 4.30 in the morning.
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.500]   They'd come out at 5.30.
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.580]   We'd get all, we'd go there the night before and wake up in the morning, have a quick shower
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.300]   and come out and do the interview.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:49.900]   Then we went from LA, we were right up into Sacramento and we went all the way back down
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:57.420]   to what's the place I'm trying to think of, which is down the bottom, the ones that got
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.180]   the most beautiful weather in the country.
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.180]   San Diego.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:05.680]   Went down to San Diego, did an event down there, then drove all the way up to Seattle.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:11.380]   This is all after one event or following the morning shows with the news.
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.120]   Then we drove all the way up to Seattle.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.760]   This was the turning point and this is how we were rewarded, I believe.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.060]   The greatergood.com were in Seattle.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:23.580]   They came out, they did a Facebook live with the kids and we went viral.
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.840]   The very next day we did a morning show and the same thing happened.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.180]   At that event, after that morning show, people were asking the kids for autographs.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.740]   That was the whole turning point.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:40.060]   The reason I share that is when we started, we wanted people to bring sponsorship dollars
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.500]   to the table because we had an idea.
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.500]   No one wanted to jump on board.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.020]   Everyone loved the idea, but no one would commit.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:52.780]   Now we get to that story after traveling all of those miles and just going for one event
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.460]   and chasing the media.
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.740]   People could see the effort that we were making.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.980]   People could see the time that we were taking.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:03.060]   People could see and work out the money that it was costing us to do that.
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.260]   They were going, "You know what?
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:10.660]   If they're prepared to sacrifice all of that as their family, then we should take a chance
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.180]   on these guys of us getting involved."
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.940]   That going viral was a reward of all the hard work we put in.
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.540]   People started to take us seriously.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.300]   We then get on the Rachel Ray Show.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.020]   We then get on the Larry King Show.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:26.860]   We then get this red carpet event and the reality show.
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:31.460]   All of that started a steamroll and all the sponsors started to come out of the woodwork
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:37.260]   and coming to us to be a part of it because they saw the effort and the energy and the
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.420]   commitment that we were putting in.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:44.460]   My advice to anybody out there that wants to do this, you have to prove your worth first.
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.860]   You can't write on the coattails of your previous success.
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:48.860]   That's what I did.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.820]   I was very naive and I thought, "Who's not going to want to invest in me?
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:55.420]   I've already been there, done that, and created one of the largest franchise systems in the
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:56.420]   world.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.260]   People are going to ..." They did, but they're like, "You've got 200 followers.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.580]   How do we ... Yeah, but it's going to grow as we ... Yeah, we know, but how long is that
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.580]   going to take?"
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.100]   Now, we've got 100,000 across the board of Hyderdog and Baidu.
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.700]   That's what we're starting with this time.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:13.860]   We are starting with 100,000 followers and people that want to be a part of this tour
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:14.860]   in April.
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.020]   Now, it's a different game changer.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:22.780]   Anybody looking at to do this, you really have to show your commitment and your worth
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.940]   to add the value first.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:28.300]   If you don't add that value, then people aren't going to take you seriously.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.420]   Yeah, no question.
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.180]   What is your work ... Preliminary question.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.700]   Do you schedule time for fun on this trip?
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.540]   Have you been going to any national parks, doing any sightseeing, or has it just been
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.780]   100% work the whole time?
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:49.420]   Sadly enough, it's been 100% work and we've tried to fit in bits and pieces.
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:56.740]   If you have a look at our Facebook stuff, we try to get in some pieces, but this time,
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:01.580]   we are scheduling in things so we can turn it into not just the Baidu Save Tour, but
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:07.820]   also so people can live vicariously through the kids of going to some landmarks and fitting
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.020]   in that time and splitting it into two pieces.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:15.120]   We've got the tour where we're going to raise the money and we've also got the educational
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.420]   component of going to all the landmarks around the country.
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:23.420]   The answer is, it's pretty much been 100% work with little pieces in between of trying
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.940]   to do that, but now it's going to be a balance of both.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:30.940]   It's going to reward the efforts of just making this next one so tight with the events that
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.460]   we're going to be able to enjoy ourselves as well.
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.980]   How do you schedule your days in order to, you're with your family, that makes it a real
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:43.540]   challenge to do work, but yet you're also, how do you schedule your days to actually
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:47.420]   get work done in unique living circumstances like this?
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:56.500]   I'll tell you what, it's been so challenging because we don't have a, what's the word I'm
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.500]   looking for?
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.500]   A routine.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:04.460]   There's no routine and I know that humans need a routine to be able to get things very,
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:09.780]   very productive, but without having a routine, you have to fly off the seat of your pants.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.900]   We were so productive, we get so much stuff done, but yet we're late, we can be unreliable
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.540]   with phone calls.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:19.860]   If you want to schedule a three o'clock appointment phone call with me and everyone's on board,
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.540]   there's a chance that something has just come up that I've got to attend to now because
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:28.460]   it's one of the sponsors or the strategic partners or the event that's come up.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.900]   The hardest part is actually putting in a timeframe where I need to be able to call
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:36.820]   somebody and get them on board in my schedule.
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:43.060]   It's all over the place, but incredibly productive, but so many moving parts that we just can't
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:45.820]   nail things down.
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:50.340]   It's been very, very challenging that way because just with the gym, I was a guy that
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.620]   went to the gym every single day, but every time that we are somewhere, it's somewhere
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.660]   different and we can't get to the gym.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.380]   We've got some weights on board, but it's not the same.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:03.860]   I think one thing that we've learned is not having a routine and being in any environments,
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.260]   the environments totally dictate your habits.
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:12.480]   When you can't get into a habitual process of trying to find those results, that really
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:17.980]   pushes the boundaries because this is a very uncomfortable environment to be living in.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:22.340]   You say real growth comes out of being uncomfortable.
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:28.820]   I'm telling you, me and the whole, not just me, but the whole family, we are comfortable
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.460]   being uncomfortable.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.580]   That's the point that we've got to.
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.260]   It's a reality.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.080]   Nothing can shock us anymore.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.140]   We just take the punch and get back up and keep moving forward.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.380]   It's very, very much like that.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.380]   It's so unpredictable.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.380]   Exciting.
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.480]   Anthony, this has been an amazing story.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.300]   Close us out with final words of wisdom.
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.540]   Tell us about your website.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:54.020]   My audience may be interested in donating and being involved with your Bathe to Save
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.020]   tour.
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:59.940]   My audience also would be interested in hearing more about your franchise information.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:04.340]   Give us your final closing words of wisdom and please share with us any action that you'd
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.340]   like us to take.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.340]   All right.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:13.940]   I'll start with if you go to Bathe to Save.com, which is B-A-T-H-E, Bathe, T-O-S-A-V-E, Bathe
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.540]   to Save.com, you can do two things.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:21.620]   You can jump on and donate back to the greater good, which is to the rescue site, and you
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.940]   can go to the shop.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:27.780]   Click on shop and buy some merchandise, some shirts and jewelry and help fund the tour
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.780]   so we can actually take a bit of pressure off and really make this a reality.
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.120]   That would help us more than you can imagine.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:42.620]   With HydroDog.com, which is H-Y-D-R-O-D-O-G, HydroDog.com, it's very close affiliation.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:47.460]   It's the number one sponsor of the tour doing all the washes and what have you.
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.380]   Franchises will be sold very, very soon.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.660]   We're talking in a month's time we'll have our first big blue dog out of the mold ready
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.460]   to start selling franchises.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.940]   You can contact me through that.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:01.740]   We've got a master plan involved where you can buy big territory and put franchisees
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:06.020]   into compensate for the recognition that we've got.
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:10.900]   They're the two big websites that we're working really hard on to be a part of what
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.020]   we're doing.
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:18.140]   The wisdom that I can leave you with is, this is an old one, you hear it all the time, but
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.820]   to be a real entrepreneur, it's just about never giving up.
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.860]   Never, ever, ever, ever give up.
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.380]   Just keep going through.
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:29.500]   When a day looks like it's not going to happen, if you just keep your mindset right, it will.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.700]   You just don't give up.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.300]   If you give up, then that's when you lose.
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.340]   The second one is learn to live in the moment.
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.820]   It took me four years consciously to live in the moment.
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:42.380]   When you've got a problem that you know that you can't solve and you think you're trying
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:46.620]   to come up with a creative answer, you've just got to be able to learn to let it go,
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.220]   not deal with it until you have to deal with it.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.620]   Because when people say, "Oh, I can't sleep because my mind's racing," that's such a load
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:53.620]   of bullshit.
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:57.420]   It's because you're trying to problem solve something you have no control over.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:03.220]   If you consciously work out how to live in the moment and really enjoy those things along
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:07.060]   the way, that's when you're going to experience the whole journey.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.260]   As I've said to my wife, women are nesters.
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.420]   They want to have security.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.780]   They want to be in one place.
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:17.460]   It's really hard, this trip for the girls especially.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.300]   We've got to realize that it's not about the destination.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.020]   It's truly about the journey.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:26.580]   Each time that we come across a problem, just get back to living in the moment and appreciate
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.540]   all of us being together and visiting these 50 states.
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:33.580]   So, they're the two big ones for me, living in the moment, never giving up and everything
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.340]   else revolves around that to make it work.
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.940]   Anthony, so inspiring.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:44.220]   I've got all kinds of ideas about how I'm going to copy your example in future years.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.580]   Thank you for coming on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:47.580]   No worries, mate.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:48.580]   Happy days.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.580]   It was a great interview.
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.060]   You're a great bloke and I look forward to seeing you again.
