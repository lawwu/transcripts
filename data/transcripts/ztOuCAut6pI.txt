[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   I'm not very sympathetic to the, there were a hundred mile an hour winds, not because
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.660]   it's not true, but there's been enough modeling that we know that these kinds of outlier weather
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.040]   events are happening in greater and greater frequency.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.800]   Remember that crazy apocalyptic video of that exact same part of Southern California in
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.840]   2018 burning to the ground.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.880]   Can we just look at that all of us collectively, because that was six years ago.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.040]   This is not like it was a distant memory from a hundred years ago.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.080]   This idea that we were just lollygagging around and got caught off guard by a hundred mile
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.560]   an hour winds to me is completely not an acceptable answer.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.680]   We knew in 2018 that these things could happen.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.560]   We knew across the rest of the United States that these outlier weather events were happening
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.180]   in greater and greater frequency.
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.540]   If you weren't sure, you saw most of the insurance companies try to dump Southern California
[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.080]   homes fire coverage three months before this event happened.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.800]   So all this data was in the realm of the knowable.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.340]   And then when you double click and you get into a little bit more of the details, there's
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.760]   a level of incompetence bordering on criminal negligence here that we need to get to the
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.760]   bottom of.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.240]   So let me just give you a couple of facts in the 1950s, the average amount of timber,
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.660]   so wood that was harvested in California was around 6 billion board feet per year.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.420]   In the intervening 70 years that shrank to about 1.5 billion board feet.
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.840]   And so you'd say, okay, well, that's a 75% reduction.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.880]   We must be making a very explicit stance on conservation.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.120]   It turns out that that's not entirely true because what it left behind was nearly 163
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.640]   million dead trees, dead, like gone.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.420]   And so you would say, well, those things should have been removed.
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.800]   And the problem is that then there's this California Environmental Quality Act, CEQA,
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.300]   hopefully I'm pronouncing this right.
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.680]   And a whole bunch of these other regulatory policies that limited the ability of local
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.340]   governments and fire management to clear these dead trees and vegetation.
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.260]   And I think that that's a really big deal.
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.400]   And when you double click on that, here's where you find the real head scratcher, okay?
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:44.440]   Multiple bills, AB 2330, AB 1951, AB 2639, all rejected by the Democrat controlled legislator
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.320]   or worse vetoed by Governor Newsom that would have exempted these wildfire prevention projects
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.600]   from CEQA and other permitting issues.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.000]   Then there were other bills to try to minimize the risk of fires by burying power lines underground.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.440]   SB 103, as an example, went nowhere, didn't even get to the governor's desk.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.960]   So I'm just a little bit at a loss to explain these two bodies of data.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.440]   One is everybody can see that these events are happening.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.600]   Southern California lived through this exact type of moment just six years ago.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.900]   All the bills that are meant to prevent this are blocked or vetoed.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.240]   This is the ultimate expression of negligence and incompetence.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.620]   How did these fires start?
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.800]   How did they grow out of control?
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.400]   And again, I think that these wins didn't come out of nowhere in the sense that they
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.160]   caught everybody off guard.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.200]   This has happened before.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.100]   That area has gone through this exact moment.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.040]   There were laws that were proposed.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.700]   They were vetoed, okay?
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.920]   So that even if you could have controlled it, then you see certain developers like Rick
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.080]   Caruso who were able to protect the buildings that he was responsible for because he took
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.880]   proactive and protective measures.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.320]   Could those proactive and protective measures not be taken more broadly through LA County?
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.480]   Of course they could have.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.960]   Why were they not?
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.480]   And here, what we're seeing on the screen is Rick Caruso's village.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.320]   Let me ask a very specific question.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.320]   Pacific Palisades.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.440]   How much money, and we know the answer to this, how much money did the government of
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:36.160]   California spend poorly, as it turns out, on homelessness, it was about $21 billion,
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.160]   and illegal immigrants.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.380]   I don't know what the final number is there, but I suspect in the tens of billions.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.600]   If you reappropriated those dollars to these kinds of protective mechanisms in these areas,
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.840]   what would the outcome have been?
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.520]   Maybe there still would have been a fire.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.880]   Maybe there would have been damage, but it's hard for me to believe it would have been
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.120]   as bad as it is right now.
