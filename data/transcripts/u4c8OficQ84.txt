[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   I started noticing this weird phenomenon in online multiplayer games going back 30 years
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.320]   repeatedly of virtual housing crises, which is the most bizarre concept in the world to
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.320]   me.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.620]   Basically a housing crisis in the metaverse and predecessors to the metaverse on as early
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.280]   as Ultima Online when I was 19.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.600]   This is this online game that you could play and you could build houses in the game and
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.040]   put them down somewhere.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.200]   And what I found was that houses were actually like fairly cheap, like you could work long
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.400]   enough in the game to be afforded to buy blueprints for a house, which you put it somewhere, but
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.480]   there was no land to put it on.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.000]   And I at the time, I thought, Oh, I guess the server filled up.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.080]   I didn't really think much about it.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.080]   I was like, this stinks.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.800]   I didn't join the game early enough.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.680]   I'm screwed out of housing.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.680]   And then I forgot about it.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.000]   And then 20 years later, I checked back in and that housing crisis is still ongoing in
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   that game.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.280]   That game is still running a good 25 years later.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.160]   And that housing crisis remains unsolved.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.560]   And you have this entire black market for housing.
