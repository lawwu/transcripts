[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280]   here we go everybody hello mr president a time i love that house he has i love david's house
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.000]   what a house that made the biggest impression huh thank you sir i heard you have a pretty nice
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.440]   house too yeah i have a dealer in a nice house we like it's only worth 18 million right like i
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.240]   know the judge said 18 million people said palm beach has gone down a long way hello everybody
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.320]   oh
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:47.440]   thanks so much for sitting down with us mr president the all-in pods basically the four
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.560]   of us having conversations it's kind of a spectrum of different views we got sort of like a little
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:59.440]   bit of some fox news and then some msdnc at the same time so that's okay keeps it interesting
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.880]   yeah absolutely anyway chamath and i we we had a great time at the at the fundraiser that we
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.680]   did a couple weeks ago i think it turned out turned out great and i i heard the winkelvoss
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.680]   brothers are actually announcing that they're donating a million dollars each in bitcoin to you
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.160]   tomorrow so i think that's a great result to come out of it as well got to meet them for the first
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.080]   time at your house and uh terrific terrific they they did well like they might have started the
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.640]   whole thing i don't know i don't know i don't know if that court case was proper but uh they
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.680]   were very nice both of them absolutely really nice guys you know and i think maybe this is a
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.000]   good place to start in our conversation is you know one of the things i think we heard a lot
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.320]   at that dinner was just the the difficulty that people in business were having under this biden
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.920]   administration you got the crypto guys who just want a framework they just want the government to
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.480]   tell them how to operate and they can't get that you got no m&a happening right now in tech the
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.960]   real estate guys they can't get loans because the interest rates are through the roof and there's a
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.640]   credit crunch so i think one of the common themes we just heard across that dinner was that it was
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.560]   just so hard to do business right now and i guess maybe a good place to start would just be you know
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.480]   what what's the number one thing or maybe the top three things that you would do to kind of get
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:29.600]   things moving again you know if you're re-elected so i say regulation regulation and taxes okay
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.560]   you know i gave the biggest tax cut in the history of our country and a lot to business it took it
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.000]   down from look as you know they were paying people companies were paying 40 45 including state and
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.640]   city taxes in many cases and we got it down to 21 we'd like to get it down lower actually but
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.760]   we got it down and the revenues were were better than ever even with the lower rate
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.120]   we had a record record revenues which tells you a little bit about that but also the regulations and
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.840]   when i asked a lot of people a lot of big people a lot of corporate types big corporate types i
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.120]   said if you had your choice between just the taxes or just the regulations where did i do better he
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.240]   said the regulations i was the biggest cutter of regular in four years i cut more regulations
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.120]   than anybody by four nope by far not not even close and when i spoke to different people about
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.800]   the regulation versus the taxes i don't think i've ever had anybody say and the taxes were a massive
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.880]   cut you know from 37 38 if you look at it just there to 21 i don't think i ever had anybody say
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.080]   that the taxes were more important than the regulation cuts i made it possible to build i
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.160]   made it possible to do things to invest i was able to get companies with a lot of money outside of
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.840]   the usa to bring that money back in you know we cut the rate and it was crazy the rate was like
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.120]   55 so that means if they bring the money back they lose half their money before they even start
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.960]   but it was also uh impossible from a standpoint a structural standpoint a legal standpoint it's
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.160]   very hard and they were able to bring back i mean apple's an example they brought hundreds of
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.040]   billions of dollars back from other countries into the united states and invested it here
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.120]   so uh but it's very interesting because i asked the question all the time which was more important
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.320]   and almost everybody said i did an even better job and i got the biggest tax cuts the biggest
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.080]   tax cuts bigger than the reagan tax cuts but they found regulations and the regulation cuts
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.160]   were even more effective and that's where we had the great economy and that's where we had
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.280]   the most jobs ever produced so there's this odd thing that happens in certain states where
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.760]   taxes keep going up and then you start to see the states break right productivity breaks crime goes
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.440]   up and quality of life goes down but then people don't understand that taxation and all of those
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   things are correlated do you have an idea of why that is like why don't people understand universally
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.240]   that lower taxation is better for productivity well they don't understand it and it's such an
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.920]   interesting question because you look at some of these places like chicago and new york and
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.040]   and la and so many more you know i'd hate to even mention the three because there are worse examples
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.360]   than that you look at what's happened in oakland and you look at what's happened into some cities
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.560]   that are disappearing i mean they're literally just crime waves nobody lives there except for
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.480]   criminals because you can't live there you can't survive there physically you can't survive there
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.280]   and when you look at the kind of crime that we're talking about and then they take the power away
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.440]   from the police the police can't do anything if they do anything to stop it they end up losing
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.440]   their pension their house their family they end up losing everything they get put in jail and we're
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.360]   not talking about the rogue cops who do something really bad and should be taken care of badly you
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.840]   know be nasty you got to be nasty to them also but mostly i mean they these people they want to
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.200]   really like 99 they want to stop crime they hate to see it they're not allowed to even they're told
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.480]   not to do anything when you see a department store that was so proud they opened up a new store in a
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.280]   certain city and all of a sudden this over the last couple of years has happened this phenomenon
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:20.720]   where 500 usually young people walk into the store and take everything they have masks on they walk
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.080]   out with television sets air conditioners they walk out with everything this is a new phenomenon
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.760]   that's taken place and it's it's incredible uh look at drug stores look at what's going on like
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.720]   in new york you walk into a chain i've seen it twice i don't walk into too many drug stores but
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.760]   i used to love it i used to love to walk around and just look at what it is whether it's a drug
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.840]   store or department store but they told me just a little while ago i had a meeting with some people
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.480]   and they say you walk into a drug store in new york and everything's covered up with bars and
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.440]   glass and if you want just a little thing of aspirin or if you want to buy a toothbrush
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.560]   you have to wait a half an hour to get a clerk and they open up this vault and they give you a
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.160]   toothbrush or they give you it's how do you do business like that this is a phenomenon there's
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.520]   never been anything like this they didn't used to have theft of of even the most minor items they
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.720]   they had very little theft relatively speaking they didn't have theft but they had the police
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.120]   would arrest them if they did something today they don't they have limits sometimes if you
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.080]   steal less than two thousand dollars you don't get arrested so nobody steals more than two thousand
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.120]   dollars it's incredible when you see what's happened to the quality of life in our country
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.160]   and it's happened so quickly it's it's taken place so rapidly nobody's ever seen anything
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.640]   but you look at retail and i know the big deal it used to be a big deal when
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.440]   a department store moved into a city or you know a certain store opened up even in a town
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.400]   but it's usually the democrat run big cities where this problem is taking place and i don't say that
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:59.200]   as a republican i just say you look at the 25 cities the top problems they're just about all
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:05.760]   democrat the democrat run and they're also high tax high regulation states yeah no cash bail all
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.880]   these different things that have taken place they're phenomena it's a phenomena what's what's
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.960]   going on nobody's ever seen anything like it and it has to be stopped it's a horrible quality of
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.240]   life and on top of that you can't walk to a store you end up getting shot or mugged or something
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.840]   the level of crime in the cities in these big cities is is out of control nobody has ever seen
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:34.160]   anything like it mr president can i can i just ask on your point about the tax cut larry summers
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.520]   made a comment the other day and i thought maybe you could respond to his tweet that the tax cuts
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.560]   coupled with the tariffs that you've proposed would cause a massive i think he called it the
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.680]   mother of all stagflation where you would have kind of inflation because of the tariffs you
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.040]   would have economic decline because more money would start to fund an increase in prices with
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.720]   tax coming down tax cuts being put in place can you maybe just comment on on the comment made by
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:07.120]   larry summers and how we implement tax cuts without inflation well let me say that i respect
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.960]   larry summers a lot he's been right about a lot of things and obama and biden have been wrong
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:20.240]   uh certain things that he said turned out to be true certain things and uh he really i do have a
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.040]   good respect for him he's a different kind of a guy and he speaks his mind i happen to be a big
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.600]   believer in tariffs because i think tariffs give you two things they give you economic gain but
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.640]   they also give you political gain if if a country is out of control and something having nothing to
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.320]   do with economics or having nothing to do with with money coming in or money going out but other
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.000]   things that are very political because there are a lot of other things involved in countries
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.520]   you have tremendous power over a country now not everybody can say that but we can because we're
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.920]   the big piggy bank but our piggy bank is going to get smaller and smaller all the time because
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.520]   we're losing power we're losing a lot of you know countries on the dollar i mean they're going like
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.640]   flies if we ever lose that that's the equivalent of losing a war that would be an unbelievable that
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:10.720]   would really make us third world we have lost so many countries i looked the other day so russia's
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:17.680]   gone uh you you take a look ukraine doesn't sort of exist in a sense nobody knows what's going on
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.640]   there but when you look at china is essentially gone they're trying to get out of it they want
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:29.840]   they're a primary competitor uh iran is not there the other day i read where saudi arabia is willing
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.320]   to now go in various different currencies on set of the dollar this is a tragedy this is a big thing
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:43.200]   that's happening against our country and we cannot let that happen with tariffs it gives you a
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.320]   tremendous power as an example not to let that happen you say you want to do that we're going to
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.000]   put tariffs on your product coming into the united states but more importantly and that's a big
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.120]   importance but probably of more importance is they tax us we tax them reciprocal trade i think we
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.320]   should have a reciprocal trade act if china is going to charge us a hundred dollars tariff or
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:11.680]   a hundred percent tariff on a car then we should say you're going to pay a hundred percent to us
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:17.600]   you know i put on a large tariff on china cars coming in and it had a huge impact a huge positive
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.640]   impact but and biden only is doing the electric cars i don't know why that is because the electric
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.240]   cars are going to end up all being made in china by the way they're not going to be made here
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.720]   the united auto workers are going to take a blow like no unions are between that and people coming
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:37.280]   in pouring into our country unions are getting absolutely decimated absolutely trump but the
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:43.120]   reciprocal the reciprocal act is i think a very important thing when these countries and i don't
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.800]   mean just china we have other countries you could take the european union they don't want our farm
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.560]   product and they don't want our cars and they don't want anything we have a massive deficit
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:58.880]   right there but you could go with many countries and they essentially do things to us and we should
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.840]   do things to them basically it should be reciprocal one of the things we've talked about president
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.480]   trump on this podcast a lot is the deficit under your administration we added close to eight
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:13.680]   trillion under biden it's going to be paradoxically about the same number seems incredibly
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:19.760]   unpopular in washington to cut costs but that's something we're going to need to do what's your
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.920]   plan and it looks like you're going to win a second term here what's your plan in your second
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:29.280]   term to control spending can you get it under control is there the will in washington to allow
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.000]   you to do that well the biggest thing i think is growth because we can grow our way out as an
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.240]   example we have more liquid gold under our feet i use the term we have more oils we have more wells
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.200]   we have more everything than anybody else when i started we were number three now we're number one
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.600]   we were number one he's going to keep it that way until after the election if they ever won the
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.480]   election there's no more oil coming out there's no more oil they were going down oil is what
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.640]   caused the inflation you'd have nothing coming out it would be a disaster so they were intelligent
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.800]   enough to let the the oil wells continue to go they're not happy about it but if this election
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.400]   were won by them i can tell you right now you would be we would see oil go through the roof
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.800]   because they would really close it up already they're taken out of the strategic reserves just
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.120]   for politics because they want to try and keep the prices down as low as possible but the big thing
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:28.720]   we have tremendous growth potential and we have tremendous numbers of dollars that can be saved
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:35.760]   through efficiency the way we're spending money hundreds of billions of dollars what biden did
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:42.640]   with with the trillions of dollars that he borrowed for covet now i had a different situation we were
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.200]   getting ready to start paying off debt we were getting ready to make a lot we had the greatest
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:53.040]   economy in history i had to throw a lot of money at covet in order that we didn't end up in a 1929
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:58.640]   type depression which we could still end up in now because of what they've done but i threw a lot of
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.920]   money in and we ended up not in a depression and then we ended up with a very strong you know we i
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.280]   ended up with a higher stock market than it was just previous to covet coming in which was pretty
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:15.600]   much of a miracle according to most but we had to throw money out there in order to keep our country
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.560]   going we would have ended up if i didn't do that we would have ended up in a depression the problem is
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.440]   when biden came in he took trillions and trillions of dollars for covet he didn't use it for covet
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.400]   he used it for other things but he took trillions of dollars out and that caused a lot of the
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:37.520]   inflation energy caused his energy policies caused inflation and his spending the unbelievable
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:43.200]   spending that they did caused inflation tremendous inflation and it's going to have an impact for a
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.480]   long time to come can you talk about your impoundment authority intention you mentioned
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:54.160]   that in the past that you could go in and reduce the bureaucracy and the spend i always tell people
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.600]   my position going into the election is less that i'm interested in knowing what the government's
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.360]   going to do for me and i'm more interested in knowing what the government's going to stop doing
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.840]   that doesn't do any good for anyone and there seems to be a lot of that and i'm really curious
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.560]   to hear sir how you think about using the impoundment authority vested in you as the
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.200]   president of the united states to reduce some of the bureaucracy wasteful spending and create
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.920]   accountability and what's the you know is there a team that you've built around you to help build a
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.800]   specific plan on backing out of some of these issues right we have a lot of money floating
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:32.720]   around that should be brought back into the government should be given back to dc to washington
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.200]   as you know there's a lot of money given out over the last couple of years especially over the last
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.280]   my money was given out to help us with covet then they took money and they have no idea what they're
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.760]   even doing with it that money can be given back and it should be given back and things can be done
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:52.480]   with that money that a positive but we have there are many many things i'll give you an example uh
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:59.600]   education we spend more on education per pupil than any other country we spend numbers that are
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.920]   and yet we're terrible at it we're down at the bottom of the list and yet we're at the top of
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:09.200]   the list i would give i am going to very early in the administration we're going to send education
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.520]   back to the states we're going to give them approximately half the number of dollars and
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.840]   they're going to have so much money that like they've never had before because they can spend
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.520]   a fraction of what we're spending right now and have much better school systems as an example you
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:30.480]   go to very you could name many you go to nebraska you go to iowa you go to many states we'll do a
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.040]   far better job that we're doing right now and they'll do it for a fraction of the cost we'll
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.920]   save a tremendous amount of money and have better some states i don't believe we'll do a very good
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.960]   job but they're going to have to learn to but we have uh i would say most of our states will do a
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.840]   much better job i think all of them will do better than you can't do worse than what we're doing
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:56.800]   right now but all of them will do better but some will be absolutely education a factory in a
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:04.160]   positive sense factories we are going to close up education we'll have a tiny little group to make
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:10.000]   sure everyone's teaching at least english and perhaps proper math etc etc but very little
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.480]   department of education goes and education goes back to the states and where it belongs i mean
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:24.160]   where it absolutely belongs and you're going to save a lot of money you can look at interior with
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:30.320]   that you can look at environmental with a lot of that where the environment can be controlled by
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.520]   the states instead of this big bureaucracy in washington dc i mean what do you do when china
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:40.000]   is burning all the coal and they're sending the they're sending the ashes over the united states
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.840]   because that's what happens takes three and a half days and it blows over the united states in
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.880]   the meantime we're keeping things good we produce clean coal we're going to produce clean energy
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:58.160]   but we have to get back to energy we're spending trillions of dollars on artificial weak energy
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.760]   that's not going to fire up our plants our plants have to be fired up we have a phenomena coming up
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.800]   right now and i was talking about it the other day to david and that's ai little things simple two
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:16.160]   little simple letters but it's big and i realized the other day more than anything when we were at
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:22.560]   david's house and talking to a lot of geniuses from silicon valley and other places they need
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.160]   electricity at levels that nobody's ever experienced before to have to be successful
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.760]   to be a leader in ai the amount of electricity that is like double what we have right now and
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:40.400]   even triple what we have right now they are they are it's incredible how much they need
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:46.800]   to be the leader and we're gonna have to be able to do that and a windmill turning with its blade
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.520]   knocking out the birds and everything else is not going to be able to make us competitive you'll
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.160]   have china what about what about nuclear mr president yeah so let me just give you a statistic
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:02.800]   150 nuclear reactors and they're only spending about twenty five hundred dollars a kilowatt
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:08.000]   in the u.s we're not building any and our cost to build them is about ten thousand bucks a kilowatt
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.800]   and china's about to build as much capacity as twenty percent of the total u.s production
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:18.640]   in nuclear we clearly have a problem here in nuclear we do and nuclear is okay with me and
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.640]   what we're doing is you know if you look at alabama you look at a couple of states where
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.680]   they built these plants and they had cost overruns that are nobody's ever seen anything like it where
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.240]   they're costing 25 billion dollars to build a plant there were a couple of them built in the
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.320]   south i won't mention the places but you know the places and they came out at numbers that i think
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:41.040]   the most expensive things ever built in our country and the inspectors would go in they say
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.840]   those walls aren't thick enough knock them down and build another wall and you know the environmental
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.120]   people were brutal you know in france and in other places where they do have a lot of nuclear they
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.520]   build small plants all the same and if they need double the amount they'll build two of them
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:02.400]   as opposed to the nonsense that we've done where we build these massive plants and they never get
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:08.080]   built and they have cost overruns of of three four five hundred percent nobody's ever seen anything
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.840]   like it no i'm okay with nuclear but you have to do it in a way that makes sense and they they have
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:20.720]   nuclear applications today that can be built and can be built reasonably inexpensively but nuclear
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.240]   certainly is very strong power can i shift the conversation to foreign policy just for a minute
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.800]   just make sure we get we get time to talk about foreign policy is that okay with you guys yes
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.720]   mr president i really appreciate your your comments saying that you want to bring a peace
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.520]   deal to the war in ukraine so that people stop dying and i wholeheartedly agree with with that
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.320]   sentiment but i've seen that emmanuel macron the president of france is talking about actually
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:48.320]   putting nato troops or french troops in ukraine as potentially a next step and that could be a
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.920]   trip wire for more nato troops coming in can you guarantee that no matter what you're not going to
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.320]   put american boots on the ground in ukraine is that something you can say definitively i would
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.280]   guarantee it i wouldn't do it no it's different for france you know their neighbors more or less
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.400]   we have an ocean in between it's different for germany although germany is much less involved
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.680]   than they should be and other countries but uh you know we have a big ocean in between
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:19.600]   one of the things i think is so unfair david i think it's terrible is that we're giving probably
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:25.440]   we're at least a hundred billion dollars more than europe meaning europe as as a whole put together
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:31.360]   and the economies are similar size believe it or not that put together and us is about a very
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:37.280]   similar economy size but it's much more important for them it's important for everyone you have to
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.880]   have look this would have never happened if i were president it would have never put would have never
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.520]   done it and it happened for two reasons it also happened because oil went through the roof and he
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:54.560]   had he had all this money to prosecute the war but the oil was at a much lower level the price
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.720]   of oil he wouldn't have been able to afford the war all of a sudden when it hit almost a hundred
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:04.400]   dollars a barrel he said you know i mean he's one of the few to make money during a war because
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.640]   the oil has gone and it stayed very high it's extremely high right now and it's going up
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.480]   oil prices all over the country are going up as you probably have noticed but i will tell you that
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.360]   would have never happened ukraine would have never happened the israeli attack would have never
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.760]   happened and inflation would have never happened those are three big things inflation would have
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:31.760]   never happened but with ukraine and now it's very much uh look ukraine is now i read the other day
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.720]   where they don't have the soldiers they don't have the manpower they want to use children they want
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:44.240]   to use old people very old people people that are not really perhaps uh equipped to fight uh they're
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.560]   not the average age of their soldier is like 43 now so they're running out of they're literally
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.800]   running out of people to make a peace deal there would you be willing to take nato expansion off
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.200]   the table if that's what it took to get the russians and the ukrainians to make a deal
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.160]   would you be willing to do that though for 20 years i heard that nato if ukraine goes into
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.280]   nato it's a real problem for russia i've heard that for a long time and i think that's really
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.560]   why this war started i'm not sure that this war would have started uh biden was saying all of the
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:17.920]   wrong things and one of the wrong things he was saying no ukraine will go into nato that's one
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.840]   of the many things he said when i listened to him speak i said this guy is going to start a war
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.560]   because as you know for four years there was never even talk of russia going into
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:34.000]   ukraine that would have never happened russia was not going to attack ukraine as soon as i got out
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.040]   they started to form along the lines and i thought that putin maybe wilk he's a good negotiator i
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.880]   thought he was going to be doing that for negotiation purposes then all of a sudden
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:48.480]   they attacked and i said what's going on here but if you look at the rhetoric from biden uh
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:54.960]   he was saying the opposite of what in my opinion you had to say the things he was saying and he's
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:01.280]   still saying it he's saying things that are so crazy inflammatory yeah i 100 agree and you know
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:08.320]   it turns out that the month before the russians invaded blinkin told lavrov that the administration
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.800]   was not only going to bring ukraine into nato but that they thought it was okay for the united
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.920]   states to put nuclear weapons in ukraine so no wonder the russians hit the roof i mean you talk
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:23.200]   about uh provocation well let's say you were running russia you wouldn't be too happy and
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   that's always been off the table you know there it's a border and it's always been that you know
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:34.400]   i don't think that they would have if they thought that that was going to remain sort of a territory
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.320]   where you don't have nato but they don't want to have soldiers right on their border they don't
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.520]   want to have it it's always been understood and that's even before putin it's always been
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.800]   understood that that was a no-no and now you can go against their wishes and it doesn't mean they're
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.920]   right when they say that but that was very provocative and now it's even more provocative
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:00.000]   and they're talking about uh i hear routinely they're now talking about ukraine entering nato
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.600]   and now i hear france wants to go in a fight well i wish him a lot of luck i think good luck so can
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:13.040]   i ask you about israel palestine so after october 7th what's the right path to just resolve this
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.560]   once and for all and just move forward again it's so sad to me because it would have never happened
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:26.320]   iran was broke they had no money i sanctioned countries that wanted to buy oil from iran
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.400]   and i would have made a fair deal with iran i was going to get along with iran i was going to get
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.200]   along with everybody we did the abraham accords i think eventually iran would have been in the
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:42.320]   abraham accords we had four strong countries go in and nobody went in since i got out that whole
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.400]   thing should have been loaded up right now would have it should have been full they did nothing
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:51.040]   with the abraham accords that everybody said were great they said we're going to get the ultimate
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:56.000]   prize because of that it was amazing if anybody else did it if a democrat did it they would have
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.680]   they would have gotten what they would have gotten every prize in the book every prize in the book
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:06.960]   but i did it and it was a great thing that we did it was a phenomenal thing but when you look at what
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:12.320]   happened now and you see what's going on it's very very very very sad that attack would have never
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:17.600]   happened in a million years iran didn't have the money for hamas they didn't have the money for
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:22.800]   hezbollah they didn't have the money for any of the 28 other cells of terror or whatever you want
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:29.440]   to call them iran was broke i say respectfully they had no money and they weren't given money
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:34.160]   and actually it was a big story when i was uh toward the end of my term there was a lot of
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.280]   big stories that there was no terror going on because iran didn't have the money they had to
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.960]   survive we would have made a deal good for everybody everybody would have been happy the
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:49.760]   main thing is iran can't have a nuclear weapon that was my main thing the deal was a simple deal
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:55.200]   iran can't have a nuclear you know it can't have a missile can't have a nuclear missile
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.320]   it cannot have that nuclear capability other than that we talk about everything they would
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.720]   have been very happy it would have been fine and you would have had peace in the middle east the
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.280]   problem is i had them at a point where you could have negotiated a child could have made a deal
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:16.720]   with them and biden did nothing he did nothing a child like to negotiate a young man that do
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.040]   nothing or a young woman that do nothing in kindergarten could have made a deal with iran
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:26.240]   at that time because they wanted to make a deal and biden never took advantage of it now
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:32.560]   they put back no sanctions all of the different things that they gave them china buys billions
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:38.000]   and billions of dollars of oil every month many billions of dollars a month other people are
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.320]   buying so iran now has 250 billion dollars cash they made it all in three and a half years
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:49.520]   and now they're much tougher to deal with and i will tell you i got along great with kim jong-un
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:56.320]   we solved that problem nobody was in danger but this is a big problem this is a real problem and
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.000]   within 90 days or so they're going to have and could have very well a nuclear
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.560]   weapon and israel is a big is a big difference in israel between iran with a nuclear weapon and
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.520]   iran without a nuclear weapon and lots of luck in that negotiation that's going to be a much
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.840]   more difficult negotiation president trump i i wanted to ask you a question about roe v wade
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:23.200]   you promised uh your base that you would overturn roe v wade you added three people to the supreme
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.600]   court and you delivered on that promise this might be the issue that determines the election
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:34.880]   and many people believe it is are you going to do a national abortion ban would you support that yes
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:40.400]   or no so i don't need a national ban because it's up to the states right now what i did is something
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:47.520]   that people have wanted to do for from day 151 years it's been going on and if you remember over
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.800]   the years you're too young but over the years all they wanted to do is they wanted to make take it
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.760]   out of the federal government and move it into the states and i got that done with the selection of
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:04.320]   three great justices i got it done and it was a big thing but i will say over the last 10 years
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:08.560]   or maybe a little bit more than that they started talking about the number of weeks and this and
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:14.160]   that a lot of different subjects came in it was no longer just simply bringing it back every legal
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:20.480]   scholar from democrat to republican liberal conservative they all wanted it brought given
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.680]   to the states because from a legal standpoint from a lot of other standpoints including even
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:31.760]   a moral standpoint they wanted it brought back to the states and what i did is i got it back
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:39.440]   to the states and now the states are in charge and the people are voting and some votes are coming out
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:43.760]   the way certain people wanted and some votes aren't coming out the way certain people wanted
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:48.640]   i mean if you look at ohio i would say it was a more liberal vote than people would have thought
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:54.000]   and you could say that for kansas and then you look at texas it was a different story but the
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.480]   people of the states have got that issue now and they're voting and the one thing that we have to
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:05.280]   remember that there's been a lot of radicalism talked about and the radicalism is really on
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:10.960]   the left because they're willing to do abortions in the eighth and ninth month month and even
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.920]   beyond that i mean we have some people the governor take a look at the governor of virginia
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:21.680]   the former governor of virginia where he talked about we will kill the baby after the baby is
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:28.080]   born that's a very radical stance and hopefully that's all going to be taken off the table now
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:33.200]   but just to put it simply it's now up to the states and like ronald reagan i'm a believer
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:39.920]   in the exceptions the three exceptions as you know and rape incest life of the mother uh the danger
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:46.400]   for the life of the mother and we have a situation now where it's in the state's hands and
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.840]   the states are going to be voting the last thing people want the people are going to be voting
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:57.280]   the last thing people want is for that to go back into the federal government it was always fought
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:02.560]   and very importantly and people wanted it they wanted it back in the states where it belongs
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.960]   legally and for a lot of other reasons so you wouldn't support a national ban no i wouldn't
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.680]   support a national ban no i would not just shifting back to foreign policy for a moment
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:17.040]   mr president on the relationship with china it's funny how democrats and republicans seem to have
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:26.000]   a unified voice and banging the drums on the the rise of china do you think that war with china
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.440]   is inevitable and if not how do we avoid it i think it's not inevitable i think it's unlikely
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.280]   i know president xi very well and we got a long great until covid then i wasn't so happy
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.360]   with him because they gave it to us i said it came from the wuhan lab i was right about that
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:47.120]   they said then it started in italy and then it started in france it started everywhere but there
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:53.920]   but it started in china and it was a many many millions of people died all over the world and
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:59.680]   cost the world probably 60 trillion dollars which is more money than china has and more money than
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:06.160]   anybody has the death and destruction has been unbelievable but i think it's i think it's high
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:11.920]   if you have the right president uh we can live at peace with china we can do very well with china
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.800]   compete with china but we don't have the right president right now he's not respected by china
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.600]   he's being laughed at by china and he's a manchurian candidate i mean he's received money
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.280]   from china his family and that makes him to me uh somebody that shouldn't be negotiating he's got a
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:33.600]   conflict of interest uh but no i don't see war with china as being inevitable at all president
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:39.520]   trump do you think that fauci and our government funded gain of function research and do you think
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:45.760]   we should really be pursuing the investigation deeply into that and if we did fund gain of
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:51.520]   function research what does that say about our government and taking ownership of it because
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:58.000]   a lot of us lost a lot of years kids didn't go to school and uh it caused economic damage as
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   you pointed out earlier the amount of money you had to spend to try to avoid a depression was
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.840]   really severe and if we funded that what does that make you think about our government and then
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:12.640]   fauci covering it up if that is in fact true what does that make you think about our government
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:18.880]   so if you remember i'm the one that stopped it and i stopped it maybe for a lucky reason or
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:24.320]   an unusual reason i said why are we paying money to china it wasn't about gain of function or
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.440]   anything else it was why are we paying money to china china got a lot of money
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:34.720]   and they're doing fine you know we're considered like uh they want us to consider them a growing
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:40.560]   nation a nation in distress all sorts of things because they always take advantage of every treaty
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:46.960]   by saying that they need you know they're uh an improving nation i heard the other day they have
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:52.560]   all different terms for changing but they're a growing nation well we're a growing nation too
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.120]   we're a nation that's becoming a third world nation based on what we're seeing but i was the
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:02.240]   one that stopped that when i saw that i was the one that stopped that the fauci thing is an
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:09.040]   interesting phenomena uh he's a much i was not a big fan of his as you know he said no let everybody
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:15.120]   come in from china i overrode him on that i overrode him on a lot but he wanted the people
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:20.720]   from china when i heard about this i stopped it we had a room loaded up with people and nobody
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.680]   could even believe it but i stopped it we would have lost hundreds of thousands of people more
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:31.280]   maybe more much more maybe over the millions but hundreds of thousands of people more had i not
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   stopped people coming in from china did he lie to you about the origin of coven well i've always
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:42.720]   said the origin was uh you know where it came from where it originally came from was the wuhan lab
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:48.160]   i happen to think it escaped from the wuhan lab i mean i don't believe it came from uh the bats in
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:53.920]   2 000 miles away caves i don't believe it came from other countries as china tried to convince
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.880]   people it did uh i thought it should have been called the china virus because it was a very much
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:05.440]   more accurate term than covet nobody knows what covet even means why is it covet uh but uh no i
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:10.720]   was always uh but did fauci lie to you i guess is what the american people want to know did fauci
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:15.600]   lie to you and if he did should he be prosecuted i don't think uh i dealt you have to understand
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.280]   fauci was a much bigger factor in the biden administration than he was in the trump
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:25.360]   administration i didn't rely on him that much because i didn't trust him uh i would say got
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:32.400]   along with him fine not really but i didn't trust him and again i was the one that stopped the money
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.360]   going to china i didn't like it i didn't stop it because of covet i didn't stop it because of
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:43.600]   anything other than why are we paying money to china it was strange they should pay us money
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:49.280]   we shouldn't pay them money one of the things i can tell you the world health organization
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:56.960]   so we pay them almost 500 million dollars and china pays them 39 million dollars and so i got
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.360]   out of the world health organization they did absolutely nothing they called it totally wrong
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:06.720]   i got out they called me and they said we'll do anything to keep you in anything anything i said
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:12.400]   well why are they paying 39 million we're paying almost 500 million and they said well we'll work
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:18.240]   out a deal where you can pay much less i said well now you're starting to talk but even that
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.480]   it was very popular when i got out it was a very politically it would have been very hard to go
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:28.240]   back in people were thrilled that i got out i could have made a deal to go in for 39 million
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:32.560]   they offered me a deal to go in for 39 million and i actually turned it down i said you know
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:38.160]   it should be a third it should be if you look at we're 350 million they're there at 1.4 billion
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.600]   people right so it should have been 25 or less than that but i didn't want to quibble but i
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:51.760]   could have gone back in immediately for 39 million dollars as opposed to 500 then a horrible horrible
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:58.400]   election which helped destroy our country took place in 2020 and they went back in and they're
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:04.720]   paying more than 500 million dollars and they knew i could have made a deal now it's a lot of money
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:09.280]   not when you talk about the world but it's still a lot of money in it but it shows you
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:15.200]   the stupidity of the whole thing they could have made a deal for 39 million instead they're paying
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:21.760]   much more than they paid even before and that's the way the mindset of our country is and here's
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:30.000]   the big part china totally controls the who china totally controls them we have very little control
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.040]   over them and now they want to give control over a whole country to them which would be a terrible
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:41.200]   mistake fauci brings up sort of the kind of deep state personality that you talked about in 2016
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.040]   that's kind of like riddled all over the government how much progress do you think you
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:50.800]   made and how what do you want to do if you become president november and do you have goals around
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.360]   the deep state this time around and what are they well i have a lot of things i mean i did a lot of
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:38:00.480]   things in the fbi i fired a lot of their top people including comey who's terrible at what
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:06.640]   he did a terrible person and terrible at what he did uh i fired mccabe and you know i don't have to
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:13.040]   go through lisa and struck you know all of the lovers and i fired the whole group of people
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:18.880]   i got rid of them and uh and you know so many of the agents are so incredible in the fbi down below
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:24.880]   but uh we got rid of a lot we uh you take a look at the world health again we got out of the world
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:30.560]   health we got out of the this is a similar thing that you know this is really similar to your
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.080]   answer but we got out of the world health organization which was a tremendous thing
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:40.320]   we got rid of the paris accord the paris accord was a disaster for us we were going to pay a
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:46.560]   trillion dollars and other countries were paying nothing russia was paying nothing china was paying
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:52.080]   nothing it didn't even kick in for china until 2030 whereas with us it kicked in immediately
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:58.400]   so i got rid of the paris accord i did a lot of things having to do with not only people but
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:05.280]   tremendous amounts of money because the paris accord was so unfair and i said you know when
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:10.160]   i do this people are not going to like it but i have to do it because it's right people loved it
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:15.760]   the public understood it they loved it and now they've gone back into the paris accord at the
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:21.440]   same terms and even worse than the terms i got out it's really a shame it's so many things it's so
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:28.080]   sad to see so many things i i mean the who the paris accord you take a look at these things
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.160]   they could have gone back if they wanted to go back if they had it they could have gone back
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.440]   for a fraction of what they were doing and they're very unfair to the united states we're like a lap
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:43.360]   dog for every other country mr president i know you're running out of time here so about we haven't
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.120]   had a chance to for you to speak to the border situation yet so i want to give you a chance to
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:52.640]   to address that because that's always been really one of the your main issues since always since
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:57.920]   2016 you wanted to build a wall the democrats everything they could to thwart that you built
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.960]   the wall but then biden left a bunch of holes in it and then sold off the parts for scrap metal
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.480]   and now we've had the pro and repealed your executive order so i want to give you a chance
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:12.320]   to speak to that just but one piece i want to just add in as a follow-up question is a lot of tech
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:19.040]   ceos say uh if we fix the border can we get more h1 b's for tech workers so can you address that as
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:24.560]   well as what's going on at the border yes so we built hundreds of miles of wall david as you know
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.360]   and we're very proud of it we did it as per specification by the border patrol they wanted
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.960]   exactly the wall that we did with the climb paddle on top with steel concrete and then rebar and all
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.840]   of the things that they wanted they wanted to have vision through it clearly through it and because
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.800]   i thought about concrete plank frankly going up 40 or 50 feet and they they didn't like that they
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:50.000]   wanted to have vision through and i understood that too uh i sort of disagreed with it but
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.520]   that's okay we actually brought climbers in mount everest climbers to climb and and we built a very
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:02.560]   hard wall to climb it's a very effective wall uh and we built uh hundreds of miles and then we
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:10.240]   were going to add quite a bit at the very end and we we bought about 200 additional miles
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:16.800]   and it was ready to be put up could have been put up in three weeks maybe four weeks and areas that
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:21.520]   were rough areas that were people coming in because as you build the wall they go in different areas
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:28.640]   right they go further out uh the it was so effective it was so effective mexico gave us a
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.960]   lot of troops for free because of a certain negotiation that i had with them you heard that
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:40.320]   but it was so effective the wall but biden they didn't want to put up those slats that were going
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:47.280]   up routinely by us that means you had gaps you had as an example you had gates in certain area that
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:52.560]   we put up we were going to put up big powerful gates that we could open and uh you could let
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:59.040]   equipment through etc etc if you needed it and they got rid of everything they sold it for five
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:04.400]   cents on the dollar much of it five cents on the dollar i said i can't believe it and that's the
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.600]   first time that i said they're serious they actually want open borders they want an open border
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.600]   nobody could believe it i couldn't believe it because i never believed they wanted an open
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.600]   border because who would be stupid enough to want an open border look what's happened with an open
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:22.400]   border i was very proud of that we built we had the safest border in the history of our country
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.280]   and now we have the worst border in the history of the world we had a safe border i had a remain
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:33.600]   in mexico policy uh catch and release in mexico not in the united states everything was so good
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:39.040]   but the remain in mexico was a big deal not easy to get but it was a big deal they were in tijuana
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:44.640]   hundreds of thousands of people they had to be approved to come into our country and now you
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:49.840]   look at what's happened we've been overrun it's an invasion of our country by people many people
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:55.760]   come out of jails and prisons they come out of mental institutions insane asylums and we have
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.720]   terrorists coming into our country at a level that we've never seen before it's a very sad i never
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.200]   understood why the wall was so controversial you know every country needs to have a border and a
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:11.440]   wall is a really good way to enforce a border i never understood why they were so animated about
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:16.720]   stopping you from building the wall after you ran on that issue in 2016 they held you up for years
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:21.200]   with litigation and then like you said they wouldn't just finish the little pieces of it
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.760]   and they left big holes in it and i think you're right the only conclusion is they want an open
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.920]   border i mean how else do you explain it they want to destroy our country you know the fact
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:38.320]   is it's it's incredible the big mistake i made i should have said i will not build a wall we do not
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:44.320]   want a wall and that wall would have gone up in 15 minutes the more important point i think
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:50.480]   mr president is we need high skilled workers in this country yes we need to recruit the best and
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:56.000]   brightest from the world every time we get somebody super intelligent from india or europe any country
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.040]   that's one of our immigrants sir yeah and three of the four here are immigrants um the ones without
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:07.840]   the ties and we can get these great people into our country and that's a loss for our adversaries
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:12.160]   and our competitors and it's a game for us but i've never heard you talk about this can you
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:18.480]   please promise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest around the world
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.120]   to america i do promise but i happen to agree that's why i promise otherwise i wouldn't promise
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:29.440]   let me just tell you that it's so sad when we lose people from harvard m.i.t. from the greatest
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:35.120]   schools and lesser schools that are phenomenal schools also and what i wanted to do and i would
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.280]   have done this but then we had to solve the covid problem because that came in and you know sort of
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:44.960]   dominated for a little while as you perhaps know but what i want to do and what i will do is you
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:50.160]   graduate from a college i think you should get automatically as part of your diploma a green card
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:55.280]   to be able to stay in this country and that includes junior colleges too anybody graduates
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:00.160]   from a college you go in there for two years or four years if you graduate or you get a doctorate
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.480]   degree from a college you should be able to stay in this country and you know more stories than i
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:10.400]   do but i know of stories where people graduated from a top college or from a college and they
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:15.840]   desperately wanted to stay here they had a plan for a company a concept and they can't they go
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:21.600]   back to india they go back to china they do the same basic company in those places and they become
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.760]   multi-billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people and it could have been done
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:31.520]   here and a bigger example is you that you need a pool of people to work for your companies you
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.800]   have great companies and they have to be smart people not everybody can be uh less than smart
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.440]   you need brilliant people and we force the brilliant people the people that graduate
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:46.560]   from college the people that are number one in their class from the best colleges you have to
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.680]   be able to recruit these people and keep the people it was such a big deal somebody graduates
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:55.520]   at the top of the class they can't even make a deal with the company because they don't think
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:01.280]   they're going to be able to stay in the country that is going to end on day one that's fantastic
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.440]   yeah that's great well i think we all wholeheartedly agree with that being in the being
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:08.960]   in the tech industry we understand the importance of that they're telling us that you have to go to
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:12.560]   dinner mr president so thank you so much for spending so much time with us we really appreciate
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:18.800]   it it's been great having this conversation i'm sorry i have to ask one question sir when you got
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.760]   elected in 20 in the 2016 election you said the first thing or one of the things you wanted to do
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:30.480]   was release the jfk file and then you said later i saw it and i just i wasn't really ready to do it
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:35.600]   and then i saw a clip where you changed your mind and you said i think we're ready to see this file
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:43.840]   and i'm just curious what's in it what i don't know what happened like what i actually did do it
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:49.920]   i released a lot as you know but when it came to the whole thing i was hit by some people that
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:54.480]   worked for me that are great people that you would respect and they asked me not to do it and i'm
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:47:00.960]   saying why tell me why and they said sir i think it needs a little more time and i released a lot
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:07.280]   but i said if they feel so strongly i respect the people and would would have done that again
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:13.360]   but this time i'm just going to do it rfk says the cia killed his his uncle do you believe that
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:19.040]   well this wasn't cia that asked me but i think cia was probably behind it but they didn't they
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:25.120]   would have preferred that i not release the rest of it so we we did give quite a bit uh it's going
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:31.360]   to be done early on a lot of people want to see that and whatever it may say i won't say i sort
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:37.120]   of have an idea but uh whatever it is it'll be very interesting for people to see and we're
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.960]   going to have to learn from it promise us you'll come back again you know there are other things
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.840]   we're going to release too we're going to release what what else do you got we'll talk to you about
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:52.800]   it off aliens by the way i generally speaking and there are reasons not to release certain
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:57.760]   things obviously but i generally you know it's transparency and i i think it's important that
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:02.640]   we release that and there are other things too there are other things that you know about but
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:06.800]   people more than anything else they want the jfk files we're going to release that immediately
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.040]   you have a prediction for the debate next week what's going to happen
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:14.640]   well all i can say is this i watched him with paul ryan and he destroyed paul ryan
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.400]   paul ryan with the water he was chugging water at a left and right i didn't think a human being
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:24.720]   would be able to drink so much water at one time and he beat paul ryan so i'm not underestimating
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:30.880]   him i'm not underestimating him we it is what it is uh we'll see what happens but you take a look
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:36.240]   at the last one uh i happen to think he's incompetent for a lot of reasons i think he's
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:43.680]   incompetent because he has gotten the worst policies both foreign policy and internal policy
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:47.840]   i mean who would not want to have a wall who wants to have millions of people pouring in
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:53.200]   who wants to have high taxes you know taxes are going to raise by four times if this guy
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.200]   has this plan is he in cognitive decline do you believe he's in cognitive decline mr president
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.640]   i shouldn't be the one to say that but i don't think he's doing particularly well but i didn't
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:05.680]   think he was well 25 years ago i thought he was not a smart person and that was told to me by
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:10.640]   a certain member of the kennedy family who was actually very friendly with me through
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:17.120]   a palm beach relationship and he i was told that very strongly but so i was never a fan of his
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:23.200]   but i will say he beat uh he beat paul ryan it was still years ago but he beat paul ryan
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:29.680]   pretty badly and uh i assume he's going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater yeah
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:36.400]   i would say i think i don't want to underestimate him all right i think that's smart well your your
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.080]   team is telling us that uh they need you to go to a dinner mr president obviously we could keep
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:46.400]   going for hours and hours but it's been great we could uh it's been great uh great to have you for
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:50.880]   the last hour here and it's been great to getting to know you with the dinner that we did and we
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:55.600]   hope that you'll come back on our show podcasts are getting bigger and bigger so hopefully in
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:01.200]   your second term you'll come on here uh and uh talk to us again i think biden would do this
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:08.160]   interview i don't absolutely not i don't think so one question i don't think he's doing these
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:12.560]   interviews so that's it's an honor to be with you all very good question we appreciate it sir
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:18.800]   thank you very much sir thank you thank you sir there you have it wow that was some hour boys
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:26.560]   what do we think let's do a wrap up huh okay do a do a little wrap here whoo jk what are your what
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:32.960]   are your big takeaways well i'm undecided as you know we did we had a limited amount of time with
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.840]   him and obviously i'll just say it just say you like him you didn't you were just say it just say
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.240]   it because it's written all across your face just say you like him you're confused i have some
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:48.880]   questions no he crushed your questions you asked great questions and he just dealt with them head
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:51:01.680]   on just admit it you like him you like him i told you you'd like this is my point whether you whether
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:06.960]   you come out of it wanting to vote for the president or not sure everybody needs to i think
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:11.520]   just sit in a room and just hear him out if you're if you if you want me to answer the question what
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:16.000]   i'll say is there there are some blockers i have that we didn't get to january 6 obviously i did
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.080]   you know one of the blockers i have is obviously roe v wade and i think he handled that question
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:26.160]   really well and i think we may have gotten a little bit of breaking news there in terms of
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:31.680]   him saying he would not do the national ban and i think that's a big concern people have and i think
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:36.560]   that's maybe the issue according to a lot of experts i'm starting to sound like i have a lot
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:41.760]   of experts people believe that could be the deciding issue uh of the election and so i think
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:45.440]   he handled it really well by saying the states are going to choose and he's not going to do the
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:50.880]   federal exemption he was very unequivocal about that really clear that he would not do a national
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.680]   ban really clear that the states would decide and furthermore he understood that the states are
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:00.640]   deciding there's been a bunch of referenda at the state level and they are generally coming out on
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.480]   the pro-choice side and he indicated that he understood that some of the votes are not turning
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:09.440]   out the way the people which is what 80 percent of people want right 80 percent of people he's
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:14.320]   going to respect democracy yeah he's going to respect democracy on that issue yeah so i think
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:22.080]   he he nailed that that question i think he was very definitive about ukraine not entering nato
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:29.760]   and i think he was very definitive about an h1b policy that's pro productivity and immigration
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:34.800]   that was the part i like best if i'm being giving grads green cards that's like such a that's
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:38.480]   breaking news too by the way i think we elevated the discussion about immigration beyond the wall
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:42.800]   and into recruitment which is what i have been trying to do on this podcast for a couple years
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:48.400]   here now so to hear the president say i will do that for you because i want that that to me was
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:52.800]   palatable and you know there's a lot of things i agree with him on and the january 6th up we didn't
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.800]   get to so apologies to the audience on that i know a lot of people have feelings about it but
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.720]   you know you can only get so much from 50 minutes of interview i think you did a great job the whole
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:05.280]   town hall on that issue i mean quite frankly i felt like we dealt with a lot of substance here
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:09.040]   so but chamath i agree with you he was really clear on ukraine he went further than he has in
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.960]   the past in the past he said that he'll get a peace deal very quickly and then he wants the
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:18.560]   people to stop dying but in this interview he went further he said that if france or other
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.160]   european countries send in troops the u.s definitely will not participate in that we
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:26.000]   are not going to send american boots on the ground the biden administration i don't think
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:32.400]   has said that definitively the way that president trump said it moreover he understood that a major
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:40.800]   cause of the war was the desire to bring ukraine into nato and i've never heard i've never heard
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.640]   anyone in the administration say that and he went further and said they keep saying these provocative
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:50.000]   things about you know even now they keep repeating that ukraine's gonna be part of nato so he
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.040]   understood he understood the provocation there faber where's your take on him you haven't come
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:59.120]   out and said who you're voting for but this is your first time interacting with him i'll be it
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.800]   for 50 minutes in a group setting but what are you what's your impression it's a diff it's a
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:07.120]   difficult forum because we can't go deep and ask responsive questions and we don't have a lot of
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:11.120]   time and there's four of us trying to ask questions so the format is a little difficult to get to the
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:15.520]   heart of the matter on some of these complicated topics like federal spending yeah we need two
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:20.800]   hours dead yeah and and i think you need to just be able to like hone in on the question you know
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:25.520]   his response on how are we going to reduce kind of the bureaucratic overhead and the wasteful
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:29.360]   spending and the federal government and he kind of pivoted to the department of education that's
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.520]   three percent of the federal budget i want to talk about the rest of it and you know we're at it took
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:39.120]   us 200 years as a country to add a trillion dollars to our federal debt to go from zero to
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:44.000]   a trillion and now we're adding a trillion every hundred days and it's going to take a lot more
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:50.400]   than just one to three percent cuts in spending to get us out of the you know the spiral that we're
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:58.640]   in i also am concerned very um i think very rightly so and i think he acknowledges the concerns that
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:04.720]   were mentioned by larry summers that tariffs plus tax cuts could lead to uh serious inflation
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:11.280]   and economic contraction those are really difficult things to do together unless you have
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:16.560]   a very clear plan for massively cutting spending at the federal level so i don't feel like i got
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.240]   to the heart of the matter on those points and as you guys know that's what i care so deeply
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:24.080]   about i think we need to fix the machine to be able to do the things we want the machine to do
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:30.240]   over time and i'm very deeply worried about that you know i had a couple of reactions to that so
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:34.320]   number one is i thought it was interesting how he reacted to the question about larry summers
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:39.600]   because he knows larry summers and he actually said several very things towards him so he may
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.680]   not agree with him on everything but he said that larry had gotten a bunch of things right
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:49.120]   and he's an interesting guy and and larry did get the inflation call right remember at the
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:54.080]   very beginning right of the biden administration so it was interesting i thought that president
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:58.880]   trump handled that question very tactfully i think it's not like do we wasn't looking to attack
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:02.800]   anyone or anything like that we really buy he's going to do this terrorist thing anyway like it
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:07.360]   seems like that's a bit of pandering maybe to the voter base it sounds like a great solution right
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:11.680]   but i don't think he's going to do it yeah once the economic advisors get together and look at
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:16.720]   the analysis and what this will do to costs of things inflation will go up etc you know maybe
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:20.960]   there's a rethink ultimately on how that's implemented and on what particular slices of
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:25.760]   the economy it's implemented so i'm sure as you point out it probably gets toned down for this to
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.920]   you know to even become a reality uh it seems yeah just on the on the second piece on the the
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:33.680]   deficit you know jake how you asked a pretty tough question there where you basically said look your
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:39.680]   your your depth the debt has grown as much under your first term as it does under biden remember
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:45.600]   that the eight trillion i mean it's almost exactly going to be the same 6.5 to date from biden 7.8
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:50.400]   trillion but i think he had a pretty good answer which was that look at the first year of covid we
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.680]   were dealing with you know a depression a potential depression yeah you mentioned that the economy
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:57:02.560]   gdp was down 30 yeah he talked about 1929 yeah yeah exactly so he basically explained that we
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:09.600]   had to do that but then after that we shouldn't have kept going and i do think that trump is just
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:14.240]   not as big a spender as biden i mean look biden's been in washington for 50 years he thinks
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:18.720]   government's the answer for everything he loves spending money and he spent trillions on covid
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:24.320]   even after we didn't need to so i get the sense that trump was a reluctant spender i'm not saying
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:32.160]   he didn't spend whereas biden i think is a eager spender and yeah i think i think any modern
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:37.120]   politician wants to spend because it's popular i just think it's their nature i think if trump
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:41.360]   had the power by himself to rein in spending i think he would i think the issue is that
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:45.200]   the president by himself can't do that much which is what my follow-up question was right i was
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:49.840]   trying to ask him can you actually do it as president or not like is there the wherewithal
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:54.960]   to do it i think the other aspect i wanted to see i'm really glad he talked about de-dollarization
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:58:01.920]   and i he mentioned it up front and so that to me really resonated it really rings true to the
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:07.760]   effect of u.s spending u.s foreign policy so much of this is driving and i'm concerned about right
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:13.280]   driving the saudis into the arms of the chinese and and other foreign adversaries to the united
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:17.520]   states and i would have really liked to have spent a little time with him on the saudi relationship
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:21.360]   where he sees that headed how the saudi relationship will affect the middle east and
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:26.880]   how the saudi relationship could affect the u.s dollar and and dollar reserves around the world
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:34.000]   but i think he's acutely aware of de-dollarization and uh foreign reserves in dollars being sold down
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.040]   and that the there are serious effects to that i didn't hear a follow-up on like what the specific
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:44.240]   responses will be uh you know to to the drivers there which i i would have loved to spend a little
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:48.080]   more time off what do you think will be the viral moments to come out of this if any what do you
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:52.400]   think the mainstream media or social media will take from this any moments you think
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:58.320]   we're breaking news or notable well i think there's a lot of clarity on a couple of important
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:04.240]   points one is no federal ban on abortion i think that that's important news for a lot of people
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:11.120]   the second is this clarity on h1 bs which is very different from what has to be done at the border
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:15.440]   and i think that was very clear and new and i think it's very positive for our community
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:20.080]   meaning the tech absolutely i think yeah that's why we we need that clarity because we're trying
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:27.280]   to hire these people and we are losing them every day and then the third was i think the clarity on
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:34.560]   nato was also very definitive and i think that that's important the fourth which was an implication
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:40.080]   of what he said which is a little depressing is i think there's a lot of us that want to see this
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:48.640]   is really palestine conflict resolved and i think what he's saying is we can't because we've let the
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:52.400]   genie out of the bottle we have an adversary now with a quarter of a trillion dollars of excess
[00:59:52.400 --> 01:00:01.040]   cash who has no incentive to negotiate iran that's iran so that's really depressing and then the
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:06.400]   fifth one was around this jfk thing i the reason why i asked the jfk question is not necessarily
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:14.480]   that i have a specific interest in jfk but it's emblematic of it's a proxy for this deep state
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:20.400]   this idea of secrets or this idea of there's a layer of people that are embedded in the united
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:25.760]   states government that decides on behalf of all of us and i think when you have somebody who can
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:32.000]   push back against that and use transparency and sunlight as the cleansing function that is what
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.920]   we need if we're going to rebuild trust in our government and institutions we're going to need a
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:40.960]   lot more transparency and if that one's hanging out there why not resolve it i mean i did he say
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:46.000]   he thinks the cia cia did it i think i heard him say that i think what i heard was he said
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.200]   the people that were influencing him not to know i think what he said was
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.080]   we should be clear about that because it could be it could be quoted out of context
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.920]   we're going to need to see the transcript on that he did not say that he thought the cia
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.240]   he did not say he didn't come anywhere close right he said that he thought the cia was behind
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.040]   influence that we're telling him yeah to not do it and he listened to them out of trust and respect
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.800]   for them which i think that's a reasonable judgment in the moment but my point is that
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:20.320]   transcript my point is exposing that is a very important way of giving the influence and power
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:26.240]   back to the people you know i've mentioned this quote from mike pompeo which is really powerful
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:32.720]   but it's something to the effect of you know the people on the top floor of the cia do not believe
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:39.920]   it's a democrat or a republican that runs america but that they do and he said that
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:45.280]   in the context of being asked what is the one regret you have or some of the biggest regrets
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:52.720]   you have in running the cia and pompeo said that he didn't fix that so i think that there's a lot
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:58.800]   of embedded versions of this establishment class that lurk in many institutions whether it's the
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:06.160]   epa whether it's the cia whether it's the nih and if there are ways in which the president can
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:12.640]   unlock the data that's necessary or the information for all of us to have a little bit
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:16.880]   more clarity on what's happening i think it's important and i think for many people
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:23.040]   that the gfk file is representative of a lot of well and then dovetailing that sacks
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:28.640]   the fauci discussion where he said i don't trust i didn't i never trusted fauci and then kind of
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.440]   pushing it on like hey do you think it should be prosecuted did we fund it or not seems pretty
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:38.480]   clear he believes we funded gain of research his position was i just didn't want to spend the money
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.360]   which i appreciate about it with china with china yeah spend the money in china yeah yeah and so
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:50.400]   what did you think of that point yeah well i i thought that his response on that was similar to
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:58.000]   a lot of his responses which is he did not take the edgy position that he was sort of being teed
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.560]   up to take i mean kind of like same thing with like the larry summers thing you know he he had
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:09.520]   mild criticism i thought for fauci but he didn't go scorched earth at all on fauci there and trust
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:18.080]   him he said yeah absolutely nobody nobody nobody trusts fauci you asked him whether fauci should be
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:23.200]   prosecuted he did not take the bait on that that's my he was very respectful actually i was very
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:29.440]   surprised to hear how he respected fauci and how he framed the his response to that question and i
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.320]   think that says a lot but can i tell you why you're surprised because i think we have been fed this is
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.200]   what i'm saying we have been fed a narrative of what president trump looks like now in fairness
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:44.800]   we're also being fed a narrative of what president biden is like and this is why you have to see these
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:50.160]   men up close and personal for yourself because david the fact that you're surprised is less about
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.520]   the fact that donald trump has changed right it's more the fact that you've been told a narrative
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:00.000]   and you've believed it and so now when you see the actual truth you have to re-underwrite hold on a
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.240]   second he's actually pretty thoughtful he's pretty presidential he doesn't go off on people that's
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.320]   not what you probably thought going in because that's not what the mainstream media portrays
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.920]   about what you should be thinking about in fairness he has gone in on people pretty hard
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.680]   over the last eight years he's a counter puncher i don't think he hits people unless they hit him
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:24.800]   first i mean that's his pattern but look i i agree with chamath here that my overall take on this
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:30.960]   and look my position is is clear because i wrote a long post on x endorsing trump a couple weeks ago
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:36.560]   but everything i heard here in this interview was consistent with the reasons why i stated i want to
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:44.000]   support him he clearly favors a pro-growth agenda he wants to keep taxes low or and reasonable he
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:51.440]   wants to reduce regulations he wanted to increase the number of h1b's get the dream team over here
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:58.160]   for tech while sealing the border while cutting down on crime in blue cities he talked about how
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:04.880]   crime was out of control he wants to negotiate peace deals he i think understands very well
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:11.840]   why we have this war going on in europe overall i heard a lot of reassuring things and i didn't
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:19.040]   hear anything that i would put in the category of a grievance or a desire for revenge you know
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.440]   the media is trying to portray him as like seeking vengeance or something like that well that's
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:28.800]   because he says he is didn't get didn't get that over and over again let's be clear he said over
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:33.360]   again i will be your retribution so he may not have said it on this podcast did you get any of
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:40.160]   that in this interview no i've just heard him say it 50 times in the last 60 days so but sax where
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:43.840]   would you like to have seen him be maybe the same clip played over and over again on where would
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:49.360]   you like to have seen him be stronger or different on any of his major positions what would you as
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:58.320]   his advisor advise him to shift or double down on a bit well i mean i think jamaath is right that
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:05.440]   with respect to the middle east the i think his position isn't perfectly clear because it's not
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.640]   only about iran in the middle east right um yeah but the truth of the matter is politically i don't
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:15.280]   know that he could say more and you know i think that's just a very very tough issue where you're
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:21.040]   bound to alienate and polarize one side of the other and so i think he's sort of definitely
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:25.280]   walking a tightrope there yeah when he says it would never have happened like i'm always like
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.760]   you know like it would never happen to me i would like to have a little more of the why
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:34.080]   why do you believe that and he never gets into the details he just says that over and over
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:39.920]   but maybe he's right you know like when i hear maybe talk what i hear is someone who's a deal
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:43.920]   maker he was a deal maker in business now he's a deal maker politically he's willing to have
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:49.680]   conversations with anybody there was even a moment when he's talking about iran where he said maybe
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:56.240]   he could have worked out a deal um but in any event he's somebody who i think is willing to
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:01.120]   negotiate which i think is a positive thing because once last time biden negotiated anything
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:05.520]   he doesn't seem interested at all i mean i didn't get to ask but you know one of the things i had
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:09.600]   chewed up was you know i just think you've done a phenomenal job in talking to people
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:16.800]   who most people feel are difficult people to get along with you know kim jong-un g putin
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.520]   i think it's a superpower is talking to dictators despots people who are
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:27.040]   cantankerous and difficult and he always seems to get the better of them or at least get
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:33.200]   he at least gets our interests as americans aligned with whatever their interests are so
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:37.440]   i think let me ask you give him a plus on that yeah i don't want to be insulting i'm asking like
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:42.400]   in the past you said that he was embracing the dictators and he was kowtowing to that i think
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:46.640]   you've said comments like that in the past where no i don't know if i said yes or something that
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:51.920]   felt like he was more trying to embrace and engage with them in a way that's like why i've always
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.760]   felt you should talk to everybody all the time um you know that that's not my issue with trump
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:59.680]   you know it's never been an issue with him i think that's a superpower the fact that he went
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:05.920]   into north korea and stepped over in the dmz you saw the look on kim jong-un's face he just kim
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:10.000]   jong-un just wants a little attention he wants a little recognition and this idea like we're not
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.320]   going to give him any recognition is stupid because if you give him a little recognition
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.720]   now you're sort of tilting him towards hey maybe you could be part of this like maybe you could
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:23.440]   come to the west and see a movie premiere or come to the nba finals as opposed to start lobbying
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:30.240]   you know dysfunctional missiles over japan like maybe we can kind of you know that video where
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.400]   they're like setting up the little press shooting in the in the conference room and he oh my god
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.600]   that video is smile on kim jong-un's face when trump says video you want me to go over i'll go
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:45.920]   should i go over should i do it now i'll go over okay i'm gonna walk and kim jong-un is
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.800]   beaming and you're like he just played him he played him like he walked 10 feet into north
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:55.200]   korea and now kim jong-un's like you know what i don't need this i guess my my big unanswered
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:00.800]   question i did want to ask him about like dalio's prediction of like the cycle of empires 500 years
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.120]   things that i was obsessed with that well let's play counterfactual freebrook what do you what do
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:10.480]   you how do you compare the answers you've heard to what you have heard or what you think president
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:14.880]   biden's answers would be to the things that you care about i honestly feel like there's a little
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.760]   bit of a blinders to the question like there's a pivot back to what i've done what i'll do
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:27.120]   versus the like let's actually talk about where we are in the debt cycle and this is exactly what
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:32.640]   like history repeating itself at the time that you take on all the debt you drive internal conflict
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:38.000]   january 6 is a great like data point you drive external conflict we've had two or three wars
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.760]   start in the last four years how do we reverse those things so that we don't repeat history
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.600]   and we sat down with dolly and we asked him this question is there a way to not repeat history and
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.600]   he said yes there is and we talked with graham allison about this and all these guys believe
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:55.440]   that there's a way to avoid it there have been moments where we've nearly had the external
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:59.280]   conflict and that's why i asked him about war with china but i want to understand if there is
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:04.480]   this broader kind of construct of what is going on because he he hits on all the data points
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:11.520]   correctly de-dollarization increased spending bloated bureaucracy conflicts around the world
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:16.160]   without taking it all into perspective and saying man like this is where empires die i guess he does
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.720]   say that right he he does actually highlight exactly what dalio doesn't do what he does
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:26.160]   though right like malay has said to the populace that's exactly yeah he just needs to take that
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:31.280]   next step and say i will cut half the people working at these places he kind of did say it
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.960]   when it came to education i don't know what your interpretations were gentlemen back to
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:40.160]   an entrepreneurial economy right allow capitalism i think he did say around regulation and then with
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:46.880]   respect to the bureaucracy he pointed to education yeah that was a good example energy he pointed to
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:52.640]   the epa the right things are on his radar screen you know uh i just hope he gets the right people
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   around him sax like yeah i mean i need you and no more juliani's and stupid people you gotta if
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:05.440]   you're gonna put him put smart we need we need a cabinet cabinet and advisors here's a nuclear on
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:13.360]   the regulation and nuclear on ai like yeah in 2016 there was not the kind of people that for example
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:22.160]   were at this fundraiser that david and i organized was i think entirely different than what you saw
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:27.600]   in 2016 and i do think there is an opportunity where if you dipped your hand like there was a
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:33.680]   young man in the audience who answered this ai question and he talked about public key private
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:40.560]   key cryptography it was beautiful it was amazing very technical person but there are all these
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.280]   people that are coming out of the woodwork to your point free bird if he can figure out how
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:51.920]   to build a cabinet with those people meaning these extremely technical thoughtful people
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.160]   then there's a real shot that you can change i hope that's right i pulled up some some data going
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:00.800]   into our conversation i just want to read this to you guys totally off topic but i i just want to
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.600]   say we can cut it out if you want but you know construction for the francis scott key bridge
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:12.800]   which is 1.6 miles long when it was built in 1977 was 141 million bucks about 740 million in today's
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:18.080]   dollars today they're estimating to repair you know that's the bridge that collapsed in baltimore
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:22.640]   they're saying it's going to cost you know two billion dollars or more to repair that bridge now
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:28.400]   you know 40 years later california's bullet train project in 2008 was supposed to cost 40 billion
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:34.080]   we're 15 years into this thing we've spent 18 billion they're now asking for 140 billion total
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:39.280]   to build 171 mile track that's a billion a mile that's a billion a mile let me just tell you this
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:44.160]   other fact china tracks are in the middle of nowhere yeah and china just spent 300 billion
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:51.680]   to build 16 000 miles of high-speed rail they're spending 18 million a mile that's two percent of
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:57.840]   the cost of the california high-speed rail system two percent per mile we are 50 times more expensive
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:04.160]   than china that is where superpowers shift that is where that is the fundamental premise of the
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:09.840]   shift that we've seen five six times in the last 500 years that's the question yeah i mean is it
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:15.280]   just time to privatize all this stuff it's layers it's layers of you know yeah these two men trump
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:19.120]   or biden which one do you think is going to be more skeptical of big government spending and
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.800]   which one is going to be more interested in being conducive to the private sector solving problems
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:30.000]   i mean to me there's no comparison well which one which one do you think obviously trump is
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.680]   is his all of his instincts are let's empower the private sector let's cut regulations let's make
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:41.600]   taxes reasonable let's get the smartest people in the country let's have peace deals let's have
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:47.840]   growth what do you think friedberg i have heard conversations that there is an economic argument
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:51.920]   i don't know if i buy it that one of the reasons that they're trying to leave the border open
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:59.360]   is there is a um low cost labor pool that grows that actually is is beneficial to economic growth
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.600]   that um there's just not enough in the workforce today to like think about the cost of building
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:10.960]   that railroad in china versus the u.s you know the the average income in the u.s is is a a couple
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:16.320]   turns on what it is in china you can also say you don't want to answer the question between the two
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:24.160]   yeah man um ask this question more specifically yeah ask me yeah honestly who do you think is
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:29.520]   closer to your desired outcome trump or biden i i think trump hits on it like way more than
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.720]   biden does yeah he definitely hits on the concerns that i have i don't know if he has like the path
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.800]   that makes me feel like great let's you know like this is gonna work biden does biden and and i
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.960]   think the other thing i worry about is the leadership problem with trump meaning i don't
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:48.800]   mean him as a leader in terms of effectiveness but just this like trump derangement syndrome
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:53.600]   is not something to be ignored and to be disparaging of the people that we all you
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:57.520]   know that not we all the people say have trump derangement syndrome it's a fundamental like
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:02.800]   tilting that he does and he tilts half the people in the country he tilts them and i think that that
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:06.640]   is really and maybe the other side as well maybe it's a psychological problem that a lot of people
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.080]   have it doesn't mean we should have a worse president no so that's what that's one argument
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:16.320]   or yeah or maybe he when he tried maybe there's a way to use unifying speech instead of divisive
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:22.400]   speech and that is my other concern is just like or or you speak directly to the people and you end
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:30.880]   up where jake ellis at and where you're at which is you've heard him face to face really for the
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:35.200]   first time i want to hear biden face to face i want to have a long conversation we don't have
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.560]   none here we invited biden on here too and we're waiting breathlessly for him to accept the
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:47.200]   invitation you got to give trump credit for coming on the show like he said yeah and took all
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:51.760]   questions yeah so you got to give trump a lot of credit for that but freeberg to your point about
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:16:00.240]   the tds for a second look when biden ran in 2020 he promised a return to normalcy that was basically
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:06.400]   his sales pitch we had just gone through covet you know there were a lot of people who had tds
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:11.680]   who were tilted by trump and what biden said is we're gonna have normalcy what actually happened
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:18.320]   well i think biden began this incredibly partisan and vindictive program of lawfare of trying to
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:25.440]   prosecute not just trump but a lot of other people we had the border basically opened up i mean biden
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:30.560]   repealed all those executive orders on day one and did create those holes in the wall there was
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:35.680]   absolutely no reason for that we had this war in ukraine that was easily avoidable if they just
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:43.360]   said the right things back in 2021 and i mean i could go on i mean on on the issue of tech like
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:48.240]   we talked about everyone feels frozen right now crypto can't get a regulatory framework no one
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:53.840]   can do mna so have we gotten the normalcy that we were promised i don't think so and on the other
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:17:00.560]   hand what i heard from trump in this interview was like it was sort of softened he did not go
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:07.520]   scorched earth when even when he invited him to he did not say i will agree he did not he had nice
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:14.640]   words to say about larry summers yes he was you know i thought this was a very moderate sounding
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.560]   trump maybe it's a different approach and i'm wrong and i'm just referencing the history with
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:23.600]   him and i do agree with you that the way he spoke today about people that have been antagonistic
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:29.360]   about him or to him like larry summers and fauci did surprise me particularly after years of him
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:33.120]   sending out these tweets every morning about people that are antagonistic about him and it
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:37.600]   was quite refreshing honestly and it felt different so you know i will give him credit
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:42.400]   on that point i will i will like agree with you on that sex for sure the point is i think that we
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:46.400]   had an opportunity to interview the president of the united states and that was congrats i think
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:52.160]   we talked about a broad spectrum of issues i wish we had more time i think he answered them precisely
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:59.760]   and i think he was candid and i think that he gave us new information which i think is important
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:08.320]   and i think it allowed you guys to see what i saw which is if you're an independent or not a
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:15.680]   republican quote-unquote by name and you have a preconceived notion of what president trump is
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:22.400]   like it's very difficult to keep that notion is my point after you hear him and after you meet him
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:27.200]   and i think that that's a very important thing to keep in mind because i don't think it says
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:33.440]   as much about president trump as it does about the lens with which we are taught to think about
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:40.000]   all of these people including president biden so i would just say you got to think for yourself
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.360]   and that's the most important takeaway and i think that we are giving people ground truth data
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:50.240]   to underwrite your own opinion all right everybody this has been another amazing episode of the all
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:53.760]   in podcast thank you david sachs for getting president trump to come on president biden you
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.400]   are of course invited to come on we encourage you to come on give us 50 minutes give us an
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:02.800]   hour and a half whatever you got no we've asked we've asked we're waiting i'm just restating it
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:08.640]   for the record had if you by some means somebody in this group says we should you know talk to the
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.640]   all in team since they're a top 10 podcast and every other presidential candidates been on
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.960]   who knows maybe somebody decides he's going to be able to keep up with the group i don't think
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:22.800]   he can keep up that's the big challenge for the rain man david sachs chamath palihapitiya
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:26.400]   your chairman dictator and the sultan of science david rupert i am the world's
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:30.800]   greatest moderator you didn't moderate today i'm sure i guess sex
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:38.720]   great job we'll see you next time great job love you boys
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:40.640]   rain man david sachs
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:47.760]   and it said we open sources to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:56.480]   love you queen of quinoa
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:10.880]   we should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:13.840]   it's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:28.800]   what you're about to be
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.960]   i'm doing all in
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:33.460]   you
