[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Cynicism is a theory about people, the idea that in general people are selfish, greedy, and dishonest.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.000]   It's really actually an assumption that we make and then we force onto all of our interactions.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.040]   Cynics, for instance, will pay lots of attention to the worst things that a person does and think,
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.240]   "Aha, I have evidence for my case," and they'll ignore or explain away the better
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.080]   things that a person does. In other words, they're thinking like a lawyer
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.000]   in the prosecution against humanity. Skepticism is different. Instead of having an assumption
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.640]   about people, skeptics want as much evidence as they can get. If cynicism is a lack of faith
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.960]   in humanity, skepticism is a lack of faith in our assumptions. Where cynics think like lawyers,
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.120]   skeptics think like scientists. Because of that, they can adapt more to new situations.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.200]   They're not naive. They can learn more and they can build stronger and better relationships.
