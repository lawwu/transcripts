[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Is there gonna be an open mic night in?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   We were gonna have you speak, Freedberg,
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.880]   but we realize you're not capable, so.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.240]   We want the show to be entertaining.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.520]   Yeah, it's not, that's not Percival, Freedberg.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.880]   You guys are missing out.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.280]   I'll tell you guys what makes my stand-up comedy so good.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.080]   Oh, God, here we go.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.160]   Oh, my God, we're back on this, Jesus Christ.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.840]   It's my creative sensibility.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.360]   So if I have some time to prep and write my script
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.080]   and read my own creative insights.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.480]   Yeah, okay, bring one joke next week.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.720]   J. Cal, for all the time we've spent together
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.960]   on this podcast, you know so little about me.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.880]   It's so depressing, I gotta be honest.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.640]   Well, you know, here's the thing about friendship.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.640]   It's a two-way street, you gotta open up a little bit.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.160]   We gotta go out and get drunk one night.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.720]   Absolutely.

[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.840]   Okay.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.400]   Okay.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.200]   Shout out.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.800]   He is the CEO of a company called Prenuvo.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.200]   Oh yeah.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.720]   Can you just flash it on the screen?
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.000]   Prenuvo.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.080]   I went to Prenuvo, and what they do is,
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.600]   they do a head-to-toe MRI scan in 45 minutes,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.000]   and they use a bunch of machine learning
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.480]   and image recognition to help a radiologist
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.080]   interpret these MRIs in real time beside you.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.320]   It's a service that you have to pay a few thousand dollars for.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.320]   So, I went to Prenuvo, and I was like,
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.120]   "Oh, this is crazy."
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.840]   I was like, "This is crazy."
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.240]   I was like, "This is crazy."
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.040]   And then I went to the other location in Silicon Valley, in Redwood City, and a couple of others,
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.840]   and we mentioned it.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.360]   But the reason I'm bringing this up is he sent me an email yesterday, and he said,
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.120]   "I just want to thank you and the besties for mentioning Prenuvo."
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:53.440]   Because we had a bunch of people come, and he said, "We found no less than 11 life-saving diagnoses."
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.920]   11.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.480]   11 people.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.480]   11 individual listening to the pod.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.440]   Pod saves lives.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.240]   Went to Prenuvo.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.720]   Went to MRI.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.560]   Found all kinds of issues from a brain tumor and brain cancer to stomach cancer and other things,
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.000]   and was able to get the care that they needed.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.640]   Amazing.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.560]   Anyways, I just want to give a shout out to him for doing a lot of really important work.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.280]   And for the folks that are listening that have some money set aside and can afford to do this,
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.400]   I would just really encourage you.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.520]   We have no financial stake in it, nothing other than we are users of it.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.160]   But check out prenuvo.com, and shout out to Andrew and his team.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.040]   Okay, here we go.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.880]   Three, two, let's start the show.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.280]   The war in Ukraine has him insane in the membrane, and Biden's new disinformation council
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.200]   is going to have him detained to calm him down from tanking Solana.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.520]   He started smoking that marijuana.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.640]   You know him as the Rain Man.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.760]   He's here again, David Sacks.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.240]   How you doing?
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.720]   Have a good week?
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.000]   Not bad.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.960]   All right.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.440]   Big energy this week, huh?
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.760]   Okay.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.080]   In high school, he had no friends, but thanks to the pod, undergrads are in his DMs, all forms of
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.480]   stake, he's a purge, and he's the vanguard of all the virgins, the queen of quinoa, the
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.720]   Sultan of Science, David Friedberg.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.920]   Wait, I missed like half of that because Chamath was laughing so hard.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.560]   I can do it again.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.120]   Do it again.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.760]   Do it again.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.640]   Let me try from the top.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.960]   Outtakes.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.920]   In high school, he had no friends, but thanks to the pod, undergrads are in his DMs, all
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.240]   forms of stake, he's a purge, and he's the vanguard of all the virgins, the queen of
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.000]   quinoa, the Sultan of Science.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.200]   David Friedberg.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.160]   Just for the record, there's no undergrads in my DMs, but I appreciate the intro.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.200]   All right, we'll check.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.760]   All right.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.920]   In three, two, he's trying.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.200]   Warfrey Berg is tweaked and the show hasn't started.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.040]   I think I'm taking over intros next week.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.440]   Okay, do it.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.640]   I'm at least gonna do J Cal.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.040]   Please, by all means, next week you do mine.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.240]   You're a comedian who has a chance to prepare in advance and think your thoughts.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.200]   Go ahead, big boy.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.000]   Give me a week.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.560]   You got it.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.800]   Okay.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.680]   Cheers next week.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.240]   Let's see these latent stand-up skills in action.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.200]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.920]   He's been hiding that.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.480]   He's taking them from us.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.680]   I don't know a lot of stand-ups who hide their ability.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.560]   You know the funny thing about hiding something and not having something?
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.000]   From the outside in, they look the same.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.080]   You can't tell the difference.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.720]   Sorry, J Cal.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.280]   I'll go over to you.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.920]   Okay.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.440]   He's dropping annual letters in luxurious sweaters.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.160]   As far as the SPACs go, well, it can only get better.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.800]   The dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.000]   Ouch.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.920]   I cannot comment on the SPACs.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.440]   Oh my God.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.840]   I mean, this is getting brutal.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.040]   Who's writing these?
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.240]   Oh my Lord.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.800]   All right, everybody.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.680]   It's been a big week.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.000]   Did you read my annual letter, any of you three assholes?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.920]   I saw your commentary.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.560]   That's a no.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.960]   I get it.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.440]   I get it.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.600]   I reviewed the table where you listed all your results, and I actually sent it to my team.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.040]   I was like, this is a really nice way of summarizing a firm's results over a long period
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.840]   of time because you had every fund and your totals and all the key metrics.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.280]   Well, can I talk about that for a second?
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.760]   Yes, please.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.720]   What's incredible about what you're saying, Sachs, is I was interested in a bunch of other
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.720]   funds that I'm invested in and their returns.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.480]   Then I've also seen a bunch of leaked fundraising decks of all kinds of other firms from growth
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.000]   stage to crossover to PE.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.520]   It's incredible that they are not standardized.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.560]   Some people only show gross IRR.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.040]   Some people show net IRR.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.080]   Some people don't show the total value of the paid-in capital, which means if you have
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.680]   a $100 fund, what is the total value?
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.360]   What is the total value of all of its holdings?
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.560]   Some people don't show DPI, which is distributions of paid-in capital, which means, okay, for
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.040]   every dollar you've taken in, how many dollars have you sent up?
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.440]   If you don't show all of them, what was shocking to me is how much you can kind of hide and
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.600]   play and manipulate the numbers.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.960]   One of the most crazy things that I saw is that there are these late-stage funds that
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.880]   write into their fundraising decks that what they actually use are lines of credit to juice
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.600]   IRR.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.720]   So what they do is if they're about to do a deal, they'll actually get a loan from a
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:09.440]   bank, put that money into a company, wait until it's about to get marked up, and then
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.600]   what they do is they actually call that original money from their LPs and pay back their capital
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.400]   call line of credit.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.040]   What does it do?
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.480]   It inflates IRR.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.560]   But this is why if you see the other numbers, it still shows that it's kind of like not
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.440]   doing much of anything.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.520]   If you ever see multi-hundred percent IRRs or high
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:36.000]   huge IRRs with zero DPI and a marginal TVPI, it's folks that are playing games to trick
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.720]   LPs.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.600]   Just a heads up to everybody.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.480]   That is so weird.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.680]   So what you're saying is, just to summarize for people in the audience who don't understand,
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.480]   hey, we get judged on the rate of return each year.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.760]   So if the stock market does 7% or 8%, we're expected to do triple that.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.640]   So we've got to hit 20%, 25% each year.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.760]   Now, the clock starts ticking when the money gets called from the LPs, the partners, and
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.880]   gets put into the company.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.440]   Correct.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.440]   So if you invest in year two of your fund, you pull the money down from the LPs, you
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.760]   put it into YouTube, whatever it is.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.920]   What you're saying is they will take a loan against that future money from a bank at an
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.240]   absurdly low interest rate, let's say 1% or 2%.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.280]   Correct.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.960]   They make the YouTube investment.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.640]   Then two years later, YouTube has a price round that marks it up 20x.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.880]   Then they put your cash in in year three of the fund, year two.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.600]   And pay back the loan.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.560]   And pay back the loan.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.120]   Now they've paid 2% two years in a row, but the thing's gone up 20x.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.360]   Correct.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.560]   That's dirty.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.360]   Well, so it's dirty enough that the SEC has actually now introduced legislation.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.080]   It was in February that basically is going to try to uncover all of this nonsense.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.400]   You'll have to be much more transparent.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.880]   The format that I used, in my opinion, is the most transparent way of not being able
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.160]   to hide the cheese.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.840]   You show all the critical elements together in a simple table that will make it very obvious
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.760]   who's playing games and who can actually make money.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.280]   There is a...
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:03.200]   There's a semi-legitimate version of the loan thing, which is where this comes from
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.720]   is a capital call loan.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.040]   So we're making a bunch of investments throughout the quarter.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.320]   A million dollars here for a seed deal, 10 million for a series A.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.840]   It's happening all the time.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.280]   You don't necessarily want to hit your LPs with capital calls for every single little
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.320]   small investment.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.440]   So what we do is you get a capital call line from SVB or something like that.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.120]   And then you do one capital call per quarter.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.160]   Right.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.200]   So they will loan you the money.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.880]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.920]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.880]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.840]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.880]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.920]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.880]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.080]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.040]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.160]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.120]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.160]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.120]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.160]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.120]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.160]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.120]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.160]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.120]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.160]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.200]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.160]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.200]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.240]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.200]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.240]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.280]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.240]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.280]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.320]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.360]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.320]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.360]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.320]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.360]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.400]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.440]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.480]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.520]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.560]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.600]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.480]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.520]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.480]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.520]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.560]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.520]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.560]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.520]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.560]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.600]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.640]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.680]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.800]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.920]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.040]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.000]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.040]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.000]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.040]   And then you do a capital call for the next quarter.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:35.760]   do we all look at when we are LPs in a fund? Well, this is what I put down. I put down the
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:41.640]   ones that I look at for everybody else that I'm an LP in. What one is that for you? Multiple
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.280]   cash investment? I need to look at the totality of it. I need to understand what is your gross
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.840]   and your net IRRs. Those are important things to understand because it shows how efficiently
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.300]   you put the money to work. Of course. But then ultimately the other two things that
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.980]   really matter is what is the total value you've created and then what percentage of that have
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:07.740]   you given back to me? Because that allows you to understand how much paper value there
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.920]   is. For example, today, let's just say you had a fund that had a TVPI, total value of
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:19.080]   paid in capital of a 5X. A 5X on a fund is incredible. But if you've distributed none
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:25.740]   of that, well, guess what? If we're sitting here in May of 2023 or 2022 rather, the total
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:30.080]   value of your paid in capital is not really 5X. It may be only 3X and it may be actually
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:37.100]   2.5X considering what the markets have done to these companies. It allows me to really
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:44.820]   understand how performant funds are in not just being a part of the game but actually
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:50.580]   generating realizations. This is the hardest part. As I told you, Jason, this past quarter,
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:55.180]   I think I passed 2X across my funds when I was managing outside capital.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:02.860]   I think, my gosh, it took me 11 years to return 2X the money. That means I've returned $2.5
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.680]   billion. You know how hard that was?
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.440]   Yeah. I mean, you got to time the exit. You have to have the ability to exit.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.560]   You can't even time the exit. You have to be constantly managing and working your portfolio.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.220]   Sometimes you're selling in secondary transactions. Sometimes you're actually trading up in private
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.720]   markets where you help this company merge with another private company. Other times,
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.620]   if I think about it, the number of times I've been able to get a loan, I've been able to
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.120]   get a loan. I've been able to get a loan. I've been able to get a loan. I've been able to get a loan.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.480]   The number of IPOs I've had is relatively diminutive. How do you make $2 billion where
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.600]   I've only had one IPO, which has been Slack? Yeah.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.840]   This is a really, really hard business. It was just a reminder that in the last four or five
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:43.120]   years, managing capital has seemed relatively easy. But in these next few years, you're going
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.240]   to see who's really, really good. It's kind of that old Warren Buffett quote. You can see who's
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:53.000]   naked when the tide goes up. Said another way, the last five years, raising a fund has been really
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.060]   easy. Jason:
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.900]   And writing checks has been really easy. And now comes Act Three, which is returning a multiple on
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:05.500]   the money you easily collected. And boy, is that hard. All of these new LPs-
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.380]   The other thing that I learned-
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.300]   Let me just tell you this one thing, though. All these LPs send me, even if I'm not an LP,
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.340]   they send potential LPs their performance because they're so proud of it, like quarterly. I'm like,
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.260]   "I'm not even in this fund." And they have these crazy markups, crypto investments, this, whatever,
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.500]   but they've returned no capital. And so it's like-
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:28.620]   Just to give you a sense of it, if you look at the most fantastic organization in the world,
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.740]   if it were an investment manager, which is Berkshire, their long run 50-year track record
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:40.780]   is around 20%. Gross. If you look at the most successful asset manager in the world,
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:46.540]   and I would put Blackstone at that, just incredibly good and best in class in probably three
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:52.540]   enormous parts of the worldwide economy, real estate, credit, and private equity,
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:57.660]   their long run track record is that on 200 and some odd billion dollars of private equity,
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:05.980]   and another 100 billion dollars of real estate, they've returned 2x. That's what the upper bound
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:13.020]   is. Doubling people's money and generating 15% to 20% is the best you can expect if you are really
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:17.500]   excellent and long-lived. That's the best. What do you look at, Freeberg, when you're
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.980]   an LP? What number do you care about? Because you LP other funds, and I think all of us do.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:35.100]   I made my first venture fund investment in 2006. I am still getting distributions from that fund.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:40.460]   I'm looking at it, and I'm like, "This is a 2.4x over that period of time." I'm like,
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:45.580]   "What the hell? Why did I even put this money into this fund?" I guess this makes sense for pension
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:51.420]   funds and very large balance sheet, long-range investors that need to diversify.
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:57.980]   But as an individual, I should have put my money and had liquidity on it for 16 years rather than
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:03.340]   have it locked up in a bunch of private companies sloshing around and dribble out. At the end of all
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.420]   this, I only get 2.5x my money back. Two and a half times your money in 16
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.940]   years. What's that IRR? It's like low teens. Yeah, not a great deal.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.780]   No, no. It's lower. You would have been better owning the S&P 500.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:21.180]   That's right. For me, I think the only metric that matters, which I think you're saying, Chamath,
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:29.020]   is how much cash I got out relative to cash I put in. Initially, my IRR is negative 97%.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.540]   Then it goes up to negative 80%, and then negative 60%, and negative 30%, and negative 20%.
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:41.340]   Now it's 14% because I finally got more money out than I put in. It doesn't feel to me like
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:46.780]   just generally private investing, everyone gets excited because we all get sold stories,
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.620]   and individuals all get sold stories of, "You put $1 in, you get $100 in." J. Cal. wrote a book,
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:55.500]   called How I Made $100 Million from Whatever You Invested in Uber.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.060]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:02.220]   That story, I think, gets everyone excited. But the reality is, the vast majority of the time,
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:07.180]   and if you diversify your bets like this, you're going to end up waiting a long time to get your
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:14.140]   money back. You're going to be locked up. A top performing fund is returning 2.5x after 15 years,
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:18.780]   which is not much better than investing in the S&P where you could sell that anytime you want,
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.540]   and use that cash for any purpose you want. Yeah.
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:26.940]   Well, if you did a $100,000 investment, and you returned $260,000 in 15 years,
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:31.020]   I'm on an IRR calculator right now, internal rate of return is 6.58%.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.100]   Yeah. Better off than the S&P.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:39.580]   Yeah. And if you did QQQQ, depending on how hot the market was then, yeah.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:45.820]   It's really, really, really hard to actually make money. There are always going to be periods
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.460]   where people look like geniuses and have markups, but you can really see when people have
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.580]   skill after a decade and a couple of up and down cycles.
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.380]   Same with hedge funds, by the way, right? Hedge funds put up a score every year,
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:02.300]   and in certain macro cycles that can last many, many years,
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:09.340]   everyone looks like they're doing well. And then all of a sudden, tides go out, and you lose more
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:14.060]   than you made over that period of time. And then you realize, "Holy crap, I was actually in an
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.860]   insurance business," where you get paid some small premium every year, and then you have some massive
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.380]   loss one year, and that massive loss is going to be a huge loss. And then you're going to have some
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.540]   massive loss. It turns out your underwriting wasn't good because you lose more than the
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:28.460]   sum of all of the premium you collected over that period of time. And unfortunately,
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.820]   a lot of investing looks like this, which is you have small returns for a long period of time,
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.820]   and then some massive loss, and the whole business makes you look like,
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:44.860]   along the way, a genius. But the reality is over any long cycle, most folks end up in a bad position
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:50.300]   and they end up losing the market. The SEC, by the way, has solved this for mutual,
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:59.740]   and ETFs. There's very strict standard reporting. And I do think that as, for example, if you go to
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.700]   the big banks, sorry, Sax, to interrupt. I just want to finish the last thought. If you go to the
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.500]   big banks, and you have, if you're an individual, like a doctor or a dentist or somebody, and
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.860]   they will aggregate and pool capital and put it into these funds on your behalf, as an example.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:20.220]   It looks like JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs is a $50 or $100 million LP in one of these big funds, but in
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:25.660]   fact, it's just the sum of a bunch of folks on their platform. It stands to reason that if the
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.740]   SEC can actually mandate standardized reporting for private investing, it would actually be a
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:36.060]   really good thing because all of these games will, and probably currently are, as far as I've seen in
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:40.860]   these presentations, tricking a lot of folks to put their hard-earned money into things that
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.700]   actually will never make money. And it's because if you selectively cherry pick how you present
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:50.140]   this data, you can tell a partial truth. So, you know, I would really, I would
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.980]   love, I'm happy to be compared to any organization, but every time I hear somebody
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.620]   chirping about how good they are, my only comment is, I just want to see your table in the same
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.140]   format as my table, and we can compare it because it allows me to really understand.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.340]   Yeah, liquid returns. And by the way, the point I made earlier about
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:11.180]   when markets are generally good, hedge fund, public market investors generally can look
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:16.540]   like they're doing well by having a good marginal return above the benchmark every year, and then
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.060]   one year have a big drawdown, and suddenly they realize that they're underwriting what
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:25.660]   wasn't that good. The same can be true in private investing in the opposite way, in the sense that
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:30.220]   you'll put in small checks, small checks, and lose money and lose money and lose money and then have
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.860]   one big banger, and you get 100x return, and you look like a genius, because your whole portfolio
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.380]   looks good. But you fast forward and you keep doing that for another 10 years, all those small
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:43.900]   checks may not even add up to the banger. And that's, that's the flip reality that you realize.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.780]   And by the way, I think that's a good analogy for the difference between public and private
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.980]   investing. You have similar cash flow economics, where you can have small
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.300]   returns and then a big loss in public. And you can have small losses and then a big return in
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:59.340]   private. And the timing of when you present your data can make anyone look good if you catch a good
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:04.540]   hit at the right time, or you don't have a bad hit at the wrong time. And then the framing over
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.940]   a long enough period of time, I think really becomes the key measure. And the reality is most
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.820]   people don't make it long enough in their career to actually to actually present true results in
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:14.860]   how they really do underwrite.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:19.260]   And by the way, to the extent anybody's listening is able to invest in these private funds,
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.580]   I think Jason mentioned this superficially. So let me just dig into it, because I think it's
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:29.580]   really, really thoughtful what he said, which you should understand. If you have the option
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:34.940]   to invest in a private fund, you have to understand that that private fund has two huge
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:40.700]   negative things working against it relative to investing in the S&P 500. So you could put your
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:45.740]   money into a Vanguard ETF. Or if you could put your money into a private fund, you need to realize
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.180]   two things. Number one is it is illiquid.
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:53.260]   And not just for 10 years, but it could be illiquid for 12 or 14 or in, you know,
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:20:00.060]   Friedberg's case, 16 years. So you need to get paid a premium for owning that. And then the
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:05.580]   second is depending on the business model, you may have very high failure rates, which means that you
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:12.060]   need to really hit these outsize Grand Slam home runs. And if you don't, then you're going to be
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:17.740]   worse off than if you invested in the S&P 500. So that deserves a premium. And so Jason's right,
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.100]   which is the S&P 500 is a premium. And so Jason's right, which is the S&P 500 is a premium.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:19.500]   And so Jason's right, which is the S&P 500 is a premium. And so Jason's right, which is the S&P 500 is a
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:19.500]   premium. And so Jason's right, which is the S&P 500 is a premium. And so Jason's right, which is
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:26.700]   between 7% and 8% over long periods of time, predictable compounding. You have to add another
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:34.460]   7% to 8% for this illiquidity premium, and another 7% to 8% for the business model viability of, for
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.660]   example, being in venture. When you add those three things together, you do need to get paid
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:46.620]   basically in the low to mid 20s returns to be justified. Otherwise, you are much better off
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.020]   just owning the S&P 500. Much, much better. Jason:
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:54.620]   Much, much better off. Sachs, what do you look for when you're LPN? And now that you have many
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:21:00.220]   large funds? What do you think LPs are looking for now? And what do you advise them to stay focused
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:00.940]   on? Sachs:
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:06.140]   The number one metric that matters is DPI, which is the ratio of distributions to paid in capital.
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.660]   And it's basically money in versus money out, right? At the end of the day, that's all that
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.740]   matters is how much money did you put in the fund? How much money did you get out?
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:18.940]   The issue is that such a possible point, these are 10 to 12 year funds, and it takes a long time
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:24.300]   to get distributions. So all the other metrics are basically triangulations or approximations
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.700]   of what you think the fund's going to do until you actually get to distributions. So I would say
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:33.660]   in the long term, it's all DPI. In the short term, you look at TVPI, the total value to paid in
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:39.900]   capital. So it's basically what's the marked up value of all the positions in the portfolio versus
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:47.500]   how much cash has gone in. And then the big question is, does the TVPI turn into DPI?
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:47.980]   DPI.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:48.860]   Does the total value-
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:55.180]   To explain that to people, if Chamath had invested in Slack, but there hadn't been an outcome,
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:00.460]   it could be on the books for a billion dollar position. So the TVPI is looking really great.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:08.220]   But until that company goes public, and the shares are distributed, the LPs haven't realized it. So
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.940]   it could be ephemeral, or it could go down significantly as we've seen with public markets.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:18.780]   Yeah. So in the last four months, we just returned our fund one. In terms
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:26.140]   of real distributions, I think we have a DPI of 1.1 or 1.2 on that fund now. The TVPI is 4 to 5.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.300]   But it feels great just to distribute the entire fund out to LPs.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:35.020]   Literally, in my first two funds, I think we did that as well. And it's a really great feeling.
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:43.580]   Sometimes selling 10% or 20% of a position early and getting over that hurdle and just getting into
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.620]   the 1 to 2x, that's a pretty great feeling. By the way, just to talk about how difficult it is to
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:54.300]   convert paper gains into real gains, let's just say, Jason, in your example, you had a fund that
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:23:00.300]   had these huge paper gains but haven't distributed anything as coming into this year. Here's a little
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:05.180]   interesting data about the ultimate buyer of all of these tech stocks, which is the NASDAQ.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:09.820]   People that buy stocks in the NASDAQ, listen to this as of yesterday.
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:18.140]   More than 45% of stocks on the NASDAQ are now down 50%. So basically, one in two.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:27.820]   More than 22% of stocks on the NASDAQ are down 75%. So almost one in four and more than one in
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:35.020]   five. And then more than 5% of stocks, so one in 20, on the NASDAQ are down 90%.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:39.980]   So you can use this to actually get a blended average.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:48.300]   But what it means is that the ultimate buyers of tech stocks are taking a 60% discount to what
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:58.620]   they were able to buy even just four months ago. 60%. So there is no public mark that will support
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:05.980]   a private mark unless it's also discounted by at least 60%. Now think about that when you talk
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:12.860]   about this entire panoply of companies that have been overfunded, many who are under-executing and
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:18.140]   burning enormous amounts of money, who now have to come back out to the market. As any sufficient
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.140]   sophisticated buyer will have to tell them the truth, which is, "I'm sorry, guys, but the data
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.780]   says there's a 60% discount to this mark. Are you willing to accept it or not? Otherwise, the lights
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.060]   are going to go off." Yeah.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:33.420]   And these marks only happen, at least in the private markets and venture funds,
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.220]   when a transaction occurs. So if somebody raised a bunch of money,
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.460]   as we talked about in previous episodes, at a billion dollars,
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:46.860]   and they're now worth $500 million, that's only going to work itself out in fund documents and
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.980]   reports for a year. Yeah.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.940]   A year or two later when the next transaction occurs. So there is a lagging effect.
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:25:01.100]   One thing I just want to bring up before we go into maybe GDP or the Bill Hwang situation
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:07.100]   is what we talked about on this pod last year about what was going to happen in private markets.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.900]   I've been seeing the last two or three weeks, and I don't know, Sax and Freiburg, what you're seeing
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:17.820]   in private markets. But really acutely, people who are going out and skipping rounds, this
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.860]   is the first time I've seen a lot of people who are going to be in private markets. And I think
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.220]   that's a big part of the reason why I'm so excited about this. I'm going to get credit
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.540]   for work that hasn't been done. I'm going to raise $10 million without product market fit.
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:36.060]   Oh my lord, has the dialogue changed? I've been on many calls with founders who've met with 50 VCs,
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:44.140]   and the conversations are moving to, "How many months to break even? And how many customers do
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.460]   you have? And how have they increased? And let's talk about the churn." It is getting
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.220]   super pragmatic out there. If you're a founder, and we said this a year ago, but it's worth stating
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:57.420]   here, this is not the moment I would try to over optimize. If you have a term sheet or money on the
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:02.220]   table, I would close it, just founder to founder. What are you seeing, Sax?
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:06.540]   Yeah, I mean, it's gotten a lot harder, I think, especially at the growth rounds. We actually
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:13.500]   have signed two growth term sheets recently. And it was much harder for us to do growth
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.500]   rounds last year, just because you had these huge mega funds come in at crazy
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.340]   valuations. But now, they're kind of licking their wounds, and we're starting to see some really
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:25.660]   attractive growth opportunities. Everyone else is backed off. So it's interesting.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.900]   Yeah, it's changed quickly.
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.100]   Yeah. Now, one thing to, you know, to Roth raised a good point about,
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:37.740]   you know, private, not only are private valuations sort of sticky, but private marks are sticky. And,
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:41.100]   you know, companies only get remarked every couple of years. And so whereas the public markets get
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:47.340]   remarked every day. So it is hard to know, like, what is the proper valuation of a company that
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:53.180]   raised money last year? Because yes, valuation multiples have come way down, but then also,
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:58.220]   they may have grown, and their performance is better. So the analysis that I saw Jason Lemkin
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:03.740]   do in his LP newsletter, and we're basically repeating it for our entire portfolio is to
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:10.780]   calculate what was the ARR multiple that you pay, basically valuation divided by ARR, what was that
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.660]   entry multiple? And what is it today? And so we're doing that across our whole portfolio.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.700]   So what you see is,
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:23.260]   sorry, sorry, Sachs, clear, LTM ARR, or, you know, NTM ARR, which one?
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.340]   Basically, you lost 12 months next 12 months?
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:30.140]   Yeah, no, you just look at their current ARR, which is, you know, run rate, their current
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.820]   run rate revenue. Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.660]   January, you times it by 12.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.620]   Or in this case, April, April,
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.220]   basically, yes, you take the current month and multiply by 12. But they have to be annual
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:44.780]   commitments, right? So if it's not, it has to be annually recurring revenue, if they're not in,
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.020]   if it's not an annual commitment with an expectation,
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:51.100]   that's recurring, you can't count it. So for example, you don't count professional services
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:58.700]   revenue in that, in any event. So the point is, you, you basically calculate what was the multiple
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:04.460]   that you paid at, you know, entry in the company? And what is it today, as a function of the current
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:09.660]   valuation? And what we see is, yeah, there's a lot of companies that we got into, I don't know, two
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:16.860]   years ago at evaluation multiple that you couldn't defend today, 60 times 80 times 100 times. But the
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:21.740]   multiple today is more like 10 or 20 times, because it's actually grown really fast. So you
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:25.500]   need to look at both sides of the equation. And that's the analysis we're running for every
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.340]   company in our portfolio. And then you know, LPS can decide how to how to market.
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:34.620]   I mean, the most important thing is what's the next investor if they need more capital
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.500]   going to market at?
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:39.180]   Well, the question is, are you growing faster than valuation multiples are falling?
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:44.940]   Correct. And then can you that means you could have a down round a neutral round or possibly
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.700]   an up round, but it doesn't. So are you growing faster than valuation multiples are falling?
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.540]   So are you starting to see people or people discussing on the board level,
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:56.620]   or in your firm? Hey, maybe we take a sideways round, a neutral round, we just go to last year's
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.940]   price and top off another 10 million? Are you seeing that I've still told some of the boards
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.780]   I'm on just keep fundraising, just keep the round open and top off if there's money available,
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:10.140]   because you know, especially if you raised around eight months ago, six months ago,
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.460]   those prices, like if people are still willing to invest in those terms, that's a good deal.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.540]   I literally had this conversation with the founder,
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:21.420]   founder this week where they had raised that in a great valuation. And they turned money away.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.060]   Because they were like, Yeah, that was a mistake.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:28.540]   We're still growing. So why would we take the money now if our valuation is going to be,
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:34.140]   you know, double in nine months? And now it looks like Yeah, maybe you know, that extra
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:38.700]   one to $5 million would have been good to lock up. Okay. So adding to these headwinds, I think we
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:46.380]   we've been talking about the possibility of a recession for those new to the to the concept,
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:50.140]   the concept of recession if you're under the age of 30, and haven't really lived through one as an
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:56.700]   adult. It's two quarters, the official definition, two quarters of negative growth of the GDP. Well,
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:06.220]   it turns out, US GDP fell 1.4% in q1. And q4, we had a 6.9% growth rate. q1 was the weakest since
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:12.780]   the spring of 2020. When COVID hit Nick, cue the clipboard Saxon, I basically said this may happen
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.540]   in January of this year.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:20.460]   So I think the question is, you know, with the losses we're seeing, and I mean, every day,
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.220]   it just keeps like you've seen more red, that this could turn into a recession, you know,
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:30.300]   popping of bubbles is usually followed by, by recessions are, so I think, you know,
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:34.380]   the fortunes of the economy could turn really quickly here. And
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:38.460]   that is that is the marginal risk, the marginal risk is actually for recession, David is saying
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:45.580]   something really important. The risk, in my opinion, is not of runaway inflation anymore. The
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:46.060]   Fed is now a big part of the recession.
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.100]   David Chou: And the Fed is now in this really delicate situation where China cut rates last
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:53.820]   week, we have an FOMC meeting, the Open Markets Committee that sets rates on Wednesday, I think,
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.620]   of this coming week. What is he supposed to do? The risk is to a recession, because if we
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:03.900]   overcorrect, yes, and the leading indicators all around the world tell us that their economies are
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:09.420]   weak, then inflation may have actually been much more transitory than we thought. And right now,
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:14.620]   we have to decide. Because if we overcorrect, we're going to plunge the United States economy
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.900]   into a recession. David Chou:
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:16.140]   Yeah, I think that's a good point. And I think that's a good point. And I think that's a good point.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.460]   David Chou: There's a lot of data here. And obviously,
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:24.620]   this is when this data is always in the review mirror. So obviously, we're talking about Q1,
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:29.340]   it takes a while to collect this data. And there's a lot of different factors going on at the same
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:35.500]   time, obviously, COVID and obviously supply chains, consumer spending rose at a 2.7% annual
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:41.020]   rate in Q1, a slight acceleration from Q4, there was also a 9.2% rise in business spending.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:45.740]   So we have a lot of spending going on, who knows if that is spending that actually occurred,
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:50.140]   and the previous quarters and because of supply chains, like people's cars are being delivered,
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.820]   people's machines and manufacturing equipment is being delivered now.
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.580]   David Chou: We had negative GDP in Q1, for a whole host of
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:04.860]   reasons that can effectively be summarized by the fact that we are still trying to restart an economy
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:08.860]   at the tail end of a pandemic, and we're doing it in fits and starts. And so we have these small
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:15.580]   bursts of incredible GDP, which we had last year, and then contractions in the economy. The thing
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:22.220]   that's always been true about the United States is that we are a consumer driven economic engine,
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:27.900]   which means that as long as people feel confident, and they're buying things, the economy tends to do
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:34.460]   well, and we tend to move forward as a society. When consumer confidence ebbs, and people contract
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:40.540]   their spending, we are in a world of hurt. The last couple of years, we've had a lot of
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:44.940]   consumer savings, right? We've had a lot of money that's been pent up in the system, whether it's
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:52.220]   a loan forgiveness or all of this stuff has allowed people to feel much richer.
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:58.300]   As a result, they've started to spend in dribs and drabs. The problem now is that because prices
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:04.700]   are so high, all of those savings have largely been depleted. I just sent you guys a text in
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:09.580]   the group chat of what consumer spending looks like, and consumer savings rather.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:15.260]   It tells a really, really scary story, which is that the savings boom is largely
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:22.220]   over. Personal savings rate fell to 6.2% in March, the lowest since 2013. What does that mean? Well,
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:28.940]   it means that the setup is there for us to really contract what we are able to spend as a society.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:36.780]   I think now the odds even push further in this direction that we could have more quarters of
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:42.140]   negative GDP. All of a sudden, we're back to what we talked about before, which is a 2019-like
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.100]   scenario, where the government is going to be able to get rid of the debt, and the government is going
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:49.340]   to be able to get rid of the debt. The Fed, specifically, races forward to tackle inflation.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:56.700]   In 2018 and 2019, it turned out to be a head fake. By the way, in 2019, the stock market ended up
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:03.100]   more than 30%, up 32% or something like that. Crazy numbers. By the way, back then in 2019,
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:09.900]   China turned over. It looked like it was going to be a fast-moving economic recovery for China,
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.940]   and instead, they sort of slowed down. We have the same thing here. We have a quarter of negative
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:20.460]   GDP. We have China in lockdowns. We have every company that's in the manufacturing supply chain
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:25.020]   ecosystem telling the world that we don't really know what this is going to look like. Intel today
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:34.220]   actually said there's going to be shortages in chips through 2024. I think it could be a very
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:42.460]   difficult path ahead for the Fed. How do you raise rates 400 basis points into a slowing economy?
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.780]   How do you raise rates 400 basis points into a slowing economy? You could raise basis points 75,
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:51.420]   you know, 75 bps, maybe 100 bps, but it gives them very little freedom to operate without
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:55.260]   really tanking the economy. There's also another point to highlight here, which is
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:02.060]   in some of this data that was released, there was a strong indication that there are real
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:06.940]   issues right now with inventories. I don't know if you guys have tried to
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:12.220]   buy an appliance or a car lately, or a piece of furniture, but like-
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.620]   I tried in the Q4 to buy a car.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:19.100]   I mean, right now there's like one year delays to get a frigging couch. I mean,
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:25.660]   like everything in the global supply chain, somewhat related to the kind of big inflationary
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:29.580]   pressure that hit us at the end of last year, and then everyone placed orders, all the factories
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:34.220]   kind of had to produce a lot, they all couldn't keep up, through to what's going on in China right
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:39.260]   now where there's lockdowns and factories are shut down. I have several businesses in the hardware
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:44.460]   space that are actively searching and frantically trying to find a way to get the right product.
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.460]   And I think the reason for this is that you know, the market is a very competitive one.
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.700]   And so I think you know, there's a lot of things that are happening. And I think the market is a
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:56.140]   very competitive one. And I think that's one of the reasons why we're seeing this kind of surge,
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:00.780]   is that there's a lot of people who are like, you know, this is a very competitive market. And I think
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.900]   that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:04.780]   a very competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.220]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:09.100]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.940]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:15.580]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.780]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.980]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.780]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.020]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.460]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.620]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.100]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.780]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.940]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.060]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.420]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.540]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.580]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:46.300]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.980]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.020]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:49.820]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.940]   competitive market. And I think that's a very competitive market. And I think that's a very
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.640]   this adversity right now on the market, it seems an
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.740]   interestingly, and by the way, that doesn't that doesn't mean
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.980]   sorry, that doesn't mean that we're not gonna have recession.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.940]   Because, you know, when I'm not able to spend money on Apple,
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.060]   Apple spending less on their suppliers, they're spending less
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.120]   on their suppliers. So there is a trickling effect of capital
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.180]   flows and the recessionary effect may be hit. But, you
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.540]   know, there is capital and there is demand for consumption. It's
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.340]   just that we're really clogged up right now.
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:18.520]   Well, and the consumer confidence index has been on a
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:22.440]   bit of a roller coaster, we were at 130 before the pandemic. For
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.840]   the year of the pandemic, we were down in the high 80s 8788
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.540]   89. We rocketed back up. You know, in 2021, people started to
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.280]   feel like, oh, we've got these vaccines, things are gonna go
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.120]   back to normal rocket back up to 128. And it's been a slow tick
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:43.160]   down to where we're now at 107. And so I think consumers don't
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.760]   know what to think they don't know if you know, inflation is
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.340]   transitory, they don't know if gas is going to be
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:48.340]   separate.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:53.560]   $7 or $4. They don't know if they should spend a big spend on
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:58.100]   a big vacation or not. And so this I think in terms of people's
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:02.320]   planning, I don't know if people can plan how their own personal
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.100]   budgets, right. And I think that's on the confidence thing
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:10.600]   to Chamath point, we need to have a predictable economy. You
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:15.280]   know, it can't be this schizophrenic, to use the term
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.580]   sacks, what do you what do you think about what we're seeing
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:17.980]   here?
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:24.580]   In terms of, we're obviously, either in a recession, or dip, you
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.640]   know, dancing around it, we're basically, you know, on the edge
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.680]   of the cliff right now, I think it's probably the most
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:30.160]   accurate.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.980]   I tweeted in February, hey, anyone noticed that we've just
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.600]   entered a recession, and I got dunked on by all the
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.320]   professional economists, and you know, all these people, but the
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.140]   experts, the experts, the experts, exactly, correct. And
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.520]   now it's like the data just came out negative 1.5% economic
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.720]   growth in q1. So what I wrote at the time was exactly right.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.500]   And, you know, I don't know how the thread the Fed threads this
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.860]   needle. I mean, we've got a slowing economy with negative
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:02.800]   GDP growth, you've got inflation is still rampant. It's not as I
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.540]   don't think it's gonna be as high as last year, just because
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.000]   we're lapping a much bigger number from last year. So on a
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.840]   year over year basis, the comps are you started a higher price
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.860]   level, but inflation is still there. So, you know, I don't know
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:15.360]   what you do about that.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.600]   about that. It's, it's a really tough situation. And when you
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.960]   have this kind of wealth destruction in the stock market,
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:26.700]   I mean, you know, and we, there was a good tweet that you
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.900]   shared, we should put up on the screen, I mean, so much, like
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.120]   wealth has been destroyed, you don't necessarily see it if you
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.800]   just look at the big cap indices, but you look at all the
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:40.440]   engines of process, sort of growth and prosperity, the small
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.040]   caps, the recent IPO's, the growth stocks, they've been
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.360]   absolutely hammered, it really hasn't been this bad, since the
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:51.440]   dotcom crash of 2000. Like, and not just the, like, April period,
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.540]   but like, all the way in October, where it kept going.
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:57.920]   And then the 2008 recession, yeah, the 2008 real estate
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:03.140]   crash. So we're already like top three worst situations for growth
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:07.700]   stocks in the last 20 years. And when you have that kind of like
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.800]   wealth destruction, it eventually trickles down into
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.620]   the economy, because people just feel, you know, companies start
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:12.960]   cutting.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.020]   budgets, people have less money, that's built to spending
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:16.620]   goes down.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.080]   That dynamic that that we're referring to in this tweet in
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.120]   that image is called dispersion, which means, you know, people
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.680]   baby being be confused when you hear why are all these stocks
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.060]   down so much, but the the indices are not down as much.
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.600]   And it's exactly for the reason that David just said, which is
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:39.800]   that underneath the surface, the mega cap tax consumes so much of
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.920]   the market cap of these indices. So, you know, the Google,
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:47.600]   the Microsoft, the Apple's and the Tesla's, those four just clog up
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.100]   an enormous percentage, I think it's approaching 40% of these of
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:54.860]   these indices. And so underneath the surface, you have dispersion,
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.660]   which means you have these tale of two kinds of stocks, you have
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:02.540]   these four big mega caps, and then you have everybody else. And
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:05.320]   the mega caps are generating so much cash, that they're just
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.440]   basically keeping the market afloat. So at this point, maybe
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.900]   there's a small silver lining. And that silver lining is that
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:17.100]   to be bearish right now, is effectively not being bearish
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.560]   these growth stocks, because as we said, they've been just
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:23.640]   decimated. At this point to be bearish the indices means very
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.780]   specifically to be bearish those four names, and only those four
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.980]   names. And so that may actually mean that the market has
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.420]   effectively crashed already.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.600]   Yeah, but by the way, I'm not necessarily bearish on growth
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.880]   stocks from here, because like you said, they've already been
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.020]   beat up so badly. The stock market is usually a leading
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:42.600]   indicator.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.240]   What I'm a what I'm a bearish about is just the state of the
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.540]   economy because the stock market is traded down, it trades down
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.020]   on expectations. So it was already trading down months
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:56.160]   ahead of the slowdown in the real economy. So now new in
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.800]   December, the market new in November, the recession was
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.620]   coming in, like around November 6 of last year, and they knew it
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:02.580]   was coming in. Yeah,
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.580]   Mark knew when we talked about the sales that Bezos and Musk
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:09.580]   did the, you know, when when we sold equities, we were saying
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.440]   like, it's like, you can't keep all of your money,
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.620]   you know, on the table all the time, unless you have the
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:20.300]   durational wherewithal, meaning you're just not time bounded,
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.640]   and you can just be there forever. And not everybody's in
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.140]   that position.
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.300]   And endowment could be in that position, but individuals with
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.240]   no an endowment is not because they have to create
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.740]   distributions every year, right? They have to talk about the mega
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.920]   endowments where they, you know, for you know, you know, Ford or
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.060]   Harvard may not need to do this. But yeah, smaller ones might
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.720]   actually be operating, you know, Memorial Sloan Kettering might
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.520]   actually be operating their budget from it.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.740]   But just to go back to David's point, like, it's a really
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.720]   difficult spot, like, what is the Fed supposed to do? So
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.820]   they're probably going to tighten 50 basis points in May,
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.180]   that's relatively well expected, we'll be, we'll be able to
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:53.420]   digest that reasonably well. But what did they say to David's
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.940]   point, you know, if they all of a sudden go on a crazy program
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.320]   of quantitative tightening, right? And what is that again,
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.020]   that's when, you know, we were spent, they were spending, they
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:05.340]   were printing, you know, money, billions and billions of
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:09.620]   dollars, going into the market, buying securities and giving
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.700]   people the money, right?
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.700]   That's called quantitative easing. Now we're doing the
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.440]   opposite, right? So where they're selling, and they want
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.000]   the money back. Now, the problem is, what that does is that
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.300]   removes liquidity from the market. And when you remove
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.300]   liquidity from a market, you actually make it a little bit
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.960]   more fragile, a little bit more precarious, a little bit more
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:34.160]   price sensitive. And so it puts us in a very tough situation,
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:38.400]   when the economy is slowing, when these guys may be raising
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.500]   rates, and then at the same time,
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:44.220]   removing money from the system, it may be a lot for all of us to
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.500]   handle. And so I think that they're under a really difficult
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.860]   Well, and if you had a decisions,
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.440]   there is a business cycle. And you know, there are always
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.720]   recessions, recessions periodically every seven to 10
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.960]   years, but they have really magnified this because you had
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.280]   the Fed for years, maintain interest rates really too low,
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.680]   and doing quantitative easing during a boom. And then the
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.120]   federal government was printing trillions and trillions of
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:08.320]   dollars. And they didn't stop, it was one thing, but it was one thing that was really important.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:15.160]   to do it during that sort of COVID recession. But then last
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.500]   year, they printed that last 2 trillion. And that's what set off
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:20.440]   this wave of inflation. So you know, when I was like in school
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.240]   learning about economics, and they would tell us that all
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.700]   these government programs and actions are like automatic
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.740]   stabilizers, or what have you, like the government helps balance
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:31.000]   out the business cycle. No, the government like magnifies the
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.340]   business. They've made this so much worse.
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:35.500]   Well, they're putting their hand on the steering wheel, right?
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.960]   Because like, let the economy drive, let the free market do
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:38.180]   this.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.120]   And if you start, you know, you might oversee or into federal
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.860]   government is great at setting incentives, right and creating
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:46.100]   like tax credit programs and incentives for private
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.160]   enterprise to invest money. But when they act as a direct market
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.540]   participant and start to actually direct capital flows
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.420]   and make decisions about how the capital market should work, it
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.680]   never ends well, because this is not what they're good at.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.620]   Well, I think there's also another I mean, just to counter
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.960]   that there's there's also this other issue of not just
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:07.340]   incentives, but when they create a free capital that then allows
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.180]   a market.
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.360]   To find a way to take advantage of that free capital. And that's
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:15.060]   effectively what we've seen happen with Medicare, Medicaid,
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.220]   as well as with the student loan program. And, you know, I don't
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.620]   know if we're gonna get to the student loan program today. But
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.080]   I think, you know, to your point, Chamath, one of the
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.660]   things that's happened with the cost of education in this
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:31.000]   country is that the federal program, which was, you know, and
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.280]   I took a bunch of notes here to talk about this today. But the
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.940]   federal government began guaranteeing student loans in
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:37.960]   1965.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.020]   It's called the federal family education loan program. And that
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:46.240]   program made capital available for students to borrow to spend
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.660]   on universities or whatever education they want to go go
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:54.940]   get of their own choice. And the idea being that that will give
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.780]   them the ability to go make more income and extend their careers
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.880]   and educate the workforce. And the problem is that when that
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.040]   capital was made available, a lot of private universities
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.880]   started to emerge and private for profit colleges started to
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.380]   emerge.
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.400]   And in the years since that that program was introduced, I just
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:15.360]   want to give you guys some crazy statistics. So in the 1969 70
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.840]   era, the cost for a public four year college was 1200 bucks a
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:24.300]   year, that's room board tuition and fees. And in 2020, that cost
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:29.700]   rose to $21,000. And here's the the other crazy stat for private
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:36.840]   four year college in 1970 2500 a year 2019 2020 $46,000 a year.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:41.360]   And so that capital basically allowed these for profit
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.080]   organizations or these organizations that are trying to
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.620]   grow their endowments, which are effectively like for profits,
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.720]   to charge any price they wanted. And the consumer, the student
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.720]   would be able to get free capital to fund that quote
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.740]   unquote education, because it was available to them for free
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.360]   from the federal government. And so the federal government
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.100]   created a bubble in education costs. And that bubble in
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.360]   education costs has now overburdened 15%.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.060]   15%
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:11.300]   of American adults with student loans, that many of which would
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.600]   they would never be able to pay back. And now we're in this
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.280]   really awkward situation of saying, hey, maybe we should
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.260]   forgive those loans, because it's unfair that people are
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:22.680]   burdened by this. And, and doing so obviously doesn't solve the
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.180]   fundamental problem, which is that making those loans
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:28.240]   available in the first place creates an inflationary bubble
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.320]   effect in the end asset. And the end asset in this case is
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.580]   education. But we've seen the same thing with housing. And
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.600]   we've seen the same thing with pharmaceutical drugs, and
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.980]   medical care and other services. So any place where the federal
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:43.180]   government steps in and says, I will provide a backstop, I will
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:46.180]   provide free capital to support and create a quote unquote
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.560]   incentive for this market to accelerate, you end up with
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.520]   these inflationary bubble,
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.800]   you're gonna have people game the system, right? You get
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.720]   whatever University of Phoenix types and you even the large
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.980]   AJ Calderon universities raising tuition to observe things and
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:02.760]   people take these loans to moth.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.700]   Before their frontal lobes are even fully developed, and they
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.300]   have long term.
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:10.540]   Understanding of the ramifications of this. So where
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.100]   do you stand on this?
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.280]   Chamathia? So there's a there's an interesting article in the
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:18.520]   Atlantic about who really wins when you forgive student loan
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:21.160]   debt. And I and I just pulled out some facts. So I'm just
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.060]   going to look down here and read them just so I get them right.
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:28.820]   It said in the article, 13% of the US population carries
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:34.300]   federal student loan debt. grad students account for 37% of that
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.880]   federal student loan dollars.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.720]   Currently, it's 1.6 trillion of total total student debt versus
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:44.460]   about 10 trillion of mortgage debt. So the average debt has
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:50.040]   gone from about 25k in 2012 to 37k in 2022. So, you know,
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.780]   almost a 50% increase in a decade. The majority of student
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:59.500]   debt is held by white borrowers. Only 23% of black Americans age
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:04.560]   24 or greater have a college degree in 2019. So the majority
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.700]   of the black population would not be doing college degrees.
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.340]   So it's really hard to see that. But the average debt is still a
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.660]   50% increase in a decade. So that's a pretty good estimate. So
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.360]   we're going to go through some of the numbers. And then we're
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.460]   going to go through some of the numbers that were published in
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:21.080]   the paper. So the average debt is $619. That's $619. And that's
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.640]   $619. So that's $619. So that's $619. And then the average debt is
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.300]   $619. Now, let's go to the next slide. So the average debt is
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.360]   $619. So the average debt is $619. So that's $619. And the average
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:35.400]   debt is $619. So that's $619. So that's $619. And then the average
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.400]   debt is $619. And then the average debt is $619. And then the
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.400]   average debt is $619. And then the average debt is $619. And then
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.400]   the average debt is $619. And then the average debt is $619. And
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.400]   then the average debt is $619. And then the average debt is $619.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.400]   And then the average debt is $619. And then the average debt is
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.400]   $619. And then the average debt is $619. And then the average
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.400]   debt is $619. And then the average debt is $619. And then
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.400]   the average debt is $619. And then the average debt is $619.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.400]   And then the average debt is $619. And then the average debt is
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.400]   $619. And then the average debt is $619. And then the average debt is
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:12.140]   of the 2020 biden electorate graduated from a four-year college or university versus 36
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:19.820]   of democrats in 2012. So you know one of the takeaways is that this may be an issue that
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:25.960]   affects a certain percentage of the dems who went to college but it may not represent a
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:30.280]   plurality of all democrats and it doesn't represent you know a majority of all. They
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:35.160]   sure are vocal though to your point i think. Yeah i mean look this is i think that there are two
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:41.700]   motivations uh political motivations for doing this now they're pretty obvious um and then i
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:47.640]   just want to say three things on on kind of the concern about this and why i feel very strongly
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:54.780]   that if we don't fix the underlying system you cannot forgive student loans you have to fix the
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:59.140]   system before forgiving student loans. Fix it first what's the number one fix? Well so let me just say
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.260]   the two motivations the two motivations are the first one is that we don't have a system where
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.260]   students can't pay their tuition fees and the second motivation is number one this is a stimulus
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:06.260]   so this morning the biden administration said that they were thinking about taking executive action
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:11.860]   to make the first ten thousand dollars of student loans forgiven so if you do the math across 43
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:18.180]   million people that's a roughly half trillion dollar forgiveness what happens that half trillion
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:22.580]   dollars much like we saw last year becomes a stimulus payment it is money that people now
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:27.060]   have that they didn't have before it is capital that they or freedom from debt that they didn't
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.240]   have before and it will stimulate the economy so there is a very very strong motivation for
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:34.420]   students to do this and we have a very important economic incentive here to do this which is if we
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:40.340]   do it it will be stimulating to the economy and people will spend more and the economy will grow
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:44.940]   by the way that's a it's a two and a half percent boost to gdp right so half a trillion dollars of
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:49.500]   free money just flushes into the system the second thing is that it will help in the midterms is their
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:53.260]   point of view right so they've obviously done this they've done the polling here right and and it's
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:57.340]   like hey when i was in junior high the kid that ran for class president was like i'm going to make
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:00.220]   everything in the vending machine free guess what that kid got voted in. That's why we're going to
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:04.080]   get him in so you know the idea that you're just going to give everyone free give your your loans
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:08.720]   back to you for free everyone's like my gosh this is the best thing ever elizabeth warren your genius
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:13.440]   you know bernie sanders your genius joe biden your genius let's say yes and so they believe
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:18.360]   through polling that this is going to help um help them in the midterms um but the challenge is
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:24.080]   if we don't solve the problem if there's no standard of value of an education if there's
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:29.840]   no standard around whether or not a specific accredited university increases your income and
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:30.200]   earning capital that's going to help you in the midterms and so i think that's a really important
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:30.700]   thing to think about and i think that's what we're going to be doing and i think that's what we're going to be doing is we're going to be doing this for the rest of our lives.
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:34.860]   potential as an individual or increases the opportunity for you as an individual
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:40.980]   you are wasting money you are giving federal dollars to private companies who are profiteering
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:45.180]   from that and the individuals are not going to benefit from it and i think that that we're seeing
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:49.700]   this sorry and we're seeing the structurally continue in a lot of other places where the
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:54.660]   federal government doesn't hold itself accountable to the standards of how their stimulus is meant to
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:59.060]   benefit the individuals that is being funded for the individuals are not getting a good education
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.180]   in many cases they're not getting a good education they're not getting a good education they're not
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:05.800]   earning more by getting this education to moss data speaks to the average but a large percentage
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:10.280]   of people go to crappy universities that don't improve their earnings potential and then the
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:15.160]   federal government says here's this free money that private university just made a bunch of money
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:19.160]   and no one's better off and guess who's end up paying for it taxpayers are going to end up paying
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.840]   that private company a bunch of money because we're going to forgive all the loans and so we
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:28.360]   have to have a standard around whether or not a dollar should be loaned to pay for education at a
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.160]   specific university by having that university pay for it and then the federal government says
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.160]   here's this free money that private university has to pay for education at a specific university
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.160]   and so we have to have a standard around whether or not a dollar should be loaned to pay for education
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.160]   at a specific university by having that university pay for education at a specific university and
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.160]   then the federal government says here's this free money that private university has to pay for education at a specific university
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.160]   and so we have to have a standard around whether or not a dollar should be loaned to pay for education at a specific university
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.160]   and so we have to have a standard around whether or not a dollar should be loaned to pay for education at a specific university
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.160]   and so we have to have a standard around whether or not a dollar should be loaned to pay for education at a specific university
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.160]   and so we have to have a standard around whether or not a dollar should be loaned to pay for education at a specific university
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.720]   tuition is because there's so much demand because there's
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.560]   free money. And so if we actually saw the federal Loan
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.420]   Program cut back or put these standards in place, the cost of
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:56.820]   tuition would actually decline. And profiteering would decline.
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.100]   People will get a better education and the taxpayers
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.740]   would be better off. end of diatribe. Sorry.
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:03.240]   No, no, it's I think it's completely legitimate sex. We
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.840]   talked on a previous episode, about how people make things
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:10.560]   like immigration, you know, such a charge philosophical debate,
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.040]   when there are point based systems being used in Canada,
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.900]   Australia and other places that make it much more logical.
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:19.740]   Do you think the solution here is to freeberg's point of just
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:23.280]   and I'm interpreting freeberg's point as what is the value of
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.820]   this degree nursing, great nurses can take out 100% of
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.700]   their loans, because we know there's a nursing shortage. You
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:33.840]   know, philosophy, graduate students maybe can't take out
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:37.140]   more than $5,000 in debt, because we don't see a bunch of
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.460]   job openings for that.
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:40.500]   Getting a history degree at Trump University is a lot
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:41.940]   different than getting a nursing degree.
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:45.720]   So Saks, what's the solution here? And then we'll, we'll
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:45.900]   go to the next question.
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:51.900]   I'm going to give you your your swing at bat in terms of buying
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:55.140]   votes. Yeah, let's go solution first before we go partisan.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:00.660]   Look, I think that alone only makes sense when it generates ROI,
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.540]   right, it makes you're going to generate more income on the other
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:06.480]   side of that loan to make that loan worthwhile. And the problem
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.600]   here in too many cases is these kids go to these schools, they
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:14.040]   spend five years there, they get a degree in some woke nonsense.
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:15.880]   And of course, it doesn't help their earnings power.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.220]   I mean, that's a bit that's a fundamental issue here is that
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:21.500]   these degrees are worthless, right? I mean, if you go if you
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:24.620]   go to if you go to college to get, you know, to become a
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:27.460]   doctor, or maybe a computer program or something where the
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.340]   skills have value, then of course, you can pay back the
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:34.720]   loan because you get a gainful job. But, you know, otherwise,
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:37.120]   if you just major in fine arts at Harvard or something like
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:40.820]   that, I mean, you basically graduate, you get a job at what
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:43.180]   the New York Times is your dream, you can't pay back your
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:45.040]   loan, you're saddled with this enormous debt.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.980]   And think about the cultural impact that has you have this
[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:50.780]   young generation who believes in socialism. And I think this is a
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:53.380]   big part of the reason why is they have no capital and they
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:56.440]   have no ability to accumulate capital because they're so
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.460]   saddled with debt.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:00.220]   So to interpret where you said sex hard to believe in
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:02.380]   capitalism, if you got no capital,
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:06.580]   right, if you start if you start the race at negative $250,000 in
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:09.260]   debt to get a degree that was basically worthless for you.
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:10.400]   Yeah, so system is
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.660]   so long, I think maybe what we do is we reform the debt, I had
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:14.920]   actually
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:19.420]   okay with forgiving the debt in some instances, if you got a
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:21.820]   reform of the system. In other words, right, if we stopped
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:25.160]   funding these worthless degrees, but if you're basically going to
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.480]   acknowledge that, hey, we need debt forgiveness, because these
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.980]   degrees are worthless, why would you keep funding those degrees?
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:32.320]   So, you know, we need to have a like a more honest,
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:35.380]   comprehensive solution here. The other thing we should do
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:40.420]   actually, is one really crazy part of bankruptcy law is that
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:44.500]   student debt is one of the only types of debt that's not
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.780]   dischargeable in bankruptcy. I don't know if you guys know that.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:49.900]   But right under George W. Bush's presidency, explain it to everybody.
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:53.380]   Yeah, basically, look, when when if if you ever get to the point
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:55.500]   where you have too much debt, and you can never pay it back, you
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.900]   declare bankruptcy, and then the court starts you over from zero.
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.900]   So you can at least start building some wealth, right? But
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:04.600]   you lose credit, but you lose. Exactly. No one's gonna want to
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.300]   give you credit after that. But at least you're not so deep in
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:10.100]   the hole, you can never recover. So that's the point of a
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:14.080]   personal bankruptcy. But the crazy thing is that in bankruptcy,
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.680]   you cannot get your college debt, your student debt
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:20.500]   cancelled, you can get your credit card debt cancelled, you
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.480]   can get other types of debt cancelled, you can't get your
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.920]   student loans cancelled. It's crazy. So that's one thing they
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:29.380]   should fix immediately, is make these debts dischargeable.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.960]   Private market sacks, you wouldn't need to do that, right?
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:34.300]   The reason that's the case is because it's federal dollars
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:36.840]   that are funding those loans. But if it was private market
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:41.320]   dollars, people actually if banks and lenders took a loss,
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.660]   when people couldn't pay back the loans, then the market would
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.040]   work itself out. The problem is, it's the federal government
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:48.420]   stepping in and trying to be a market maker, right? And it
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:50.740]   creates this this totally crazy incentive, right?
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:52.960]   It creates it creates double distortions. On the one hand,
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.960]   like you said, it basically means that because government's
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.300]   money is funding everything, the tuition goes up because college
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.060]   just take advantage of it. But then also nobody's really making
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:04.780]   a smart ROI decision about whether a smart underwriting
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:08.420]   decision about whether this loan is worth making whether it
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:11.200]   actually stands a reasonable shot of being paid back.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.240]   There is such an easy free market solution to this.
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.820]   Yeah, absolutely. And it's called the market solution here.
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:19.540]   It's called an ISA stands for income sharing agreement. This
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:23.200]   is where you give a loan to somebody and you get a
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:27.580]   percentage of their income over a period of time capped at a
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:32.080]   certain multiple say two x. And what this does is it aligns the
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:36.040]   person giving the loan with the job that's expected to come from
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.200]   the education you already have that you already have that it's
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.620]   called taxes. Yeah, but here's the problem. Nobody's watching
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:42.120]   the store.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:42.820]   So nobody's looking at it saying,
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:46.540]   I'm going to give an ISA at this percentage return for nursing
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:49.120]   nursing. I got to pay 50% of my income every year to the federal
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.800]   government to the government like I paid taxes.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.500]   The thing we have to remember is like if the federal government
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:56.080]   tries to do this, it really is just about buying votes going
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:00.160]   into a midterm election. And here's why. If you arbitrarily
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:04.000]   give a bailout of one sliver of the population,
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.840]   unless that sliver is really, really large, which we know it
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:12.400]   is not, it's going to really anger everybody else. Think of
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.560]   all the people that are tradespeople, working class
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:17.500]   people who don't have a college degree. What are they going to
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:20.380]   think? What about all the people that just finished paying off
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:24.280]   their debt? What are they going to think? It's going to upset so
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:27.700]   many people. And ultimately what this is, is a bunch of coastal
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:33.100]   elites who are miscast in jobs and saddled with debt is pushing
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:37.900]   for a program that isn't a broad based mechanism to create equality
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:41.440]   at all. It's just a get out of jail free card for a small people
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.320]   for a small group of people who unfortunately were taken
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.420]   advantage of. And this is the thing that we're not losing
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:51.340]   sight. We're losing sight of. You can only pay back a loan if
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:55.000]   you're making more money than you owe. And the fact that this
[00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.040]   exists shows that these loans were really poorly constructed
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.980]   and they were given in instances where they should not have been
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:06.340]   in the private markets. We've seen that happen, but we go
[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:09.700]   through a cleansing mechanism to sort it out. Right? We've gone
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.200]   through- That's literally what happened during the
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.440]   2008 real estate bubble. People gave mortgages to people who could
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.740]   not pay them back. Exactly. If I as a lender think that you're
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:20.860]   not going to be able to pay back the loan, I don't give you the
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:24.400]   loan. That's the simple mechanism that exists in free
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.760]   markets. And part of the issue is a lot of people got loans
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.360]   thinking without doing the calculation, will I ever be able
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.760]   to pay this back? And they took the loan to get an education.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.100]   The other thing- The binary concept that I will just make
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:39.580]   money. But let me ask one other question of you guys. At what age
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.960]   and at what level- Yeah.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:45.100]   level do you think individuals should take responsibility for
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.380]   the decisions that they're making when they take on
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:50.500]   personal debt? Because we see ourselves getting in the cycle
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:54.460]   where consumers are given debt, they don't think about the
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:57.100]   consequences of that debt down the road or do the analysis
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.620]   themselves and maybe they're not equipped to. And they'll take
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:04.360]   out a loan on a car, on a house, on a- No, but the problem is-
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.220]   And on a loan- On an education-
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:10.720]   But here's the thing. Like education is a very dangerous thing because
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:16.600]   we put so much societal credit and external signaling to it, and we give everyone effectively
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:21.460]   the same quantum of risk. But that's not true for a credit card, nor is it true for a car loan.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:25.660]   So the private markets are efficient in that when you first try to get a credit card-
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:28.120]   Sure. You don't get an MX Centurion or
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:31.780]   platinum card. You're given a Chase Sapphire card with a $500 limit,
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:36.160]   and you earn the right to borrow more. Same if you applied for a car loan,
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.480]   the same with a mortgage, it's based on a down payment. So there's differential risk pricing.
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.620]   And if you don't have differential risk pricing, you're getting a lot of people-
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:47.380]   How would you edit education? The market would figure it out.
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:50.380]   The market would because you would differentially price the risk as you guys-
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.780]   You're literally a brainstormer right now. Like what are your grades?
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:54.580]   Well, no- What courses did you take?
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:58.600]   Whatever it is, we're not going to get it right. The market will get it right,
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:03.160]   but the market would figure it out. The problem is, and sorry, the incentive was,
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.120]   and this is a really important point. If you guys read Ray Dalio's book,
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.240]   which we've talked about a number of times, he's identified and highlighted
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:20.260]   that a growing economy in a successful country improves by improving education and having more
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:25.720]   people get higher education, generally speaking. And so the initial incentive, the initial intention
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:31.180]   behind the federal student loan program was a good one, which was to give people access to capital
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:35.200]   that the private markets were not providing at the time so that they could go out and get a higher
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:40.000]   education. We could improve the education of our workforce and we could grow our economy.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.920]   Nowadays, the question that we always forget, remember, we always get one step away and then
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:49.540]   two steps away and five steps away and we miss the point. We're in that moment now where the
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:56.020]   question really is, is the federal student loan program doing more harm than good? Are we actually
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:59.260]   creating value from our higher education system in this country or not? No.
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:03.220]   No, but most importantly, is the private market there? Because you look at the total
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:07.360]   debt outstanding, $1.7 trillion. There would be a private debt market.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.760]   Friedberg. Friedberg, don't sell beyond the close. The answer
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:16.480]   is no. We have a massive employment gap. The data tells you in every single which way possible that
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:22.840]   we are not educating our young people to take the jobs that are needed for a high growth, functionally
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:28.960]   moving economy. We know that. So we are miseducating these folks and then we are giving
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:34.780]   them access to enormous amounts of debt that they have no reasonable chance to pay back. And I think
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:39.040]   that that should be fixed by fixing the incentives of the universities. You are right. Universities
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:45.820]   are for-profit asset management businesses wrapped by this philanthropic do-gooder nonsense that they
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:50.440]   try to tell people to get you to go there and pay $50,000 a year in tuition. It's a joke.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:55.000]   And they're calling people to think that these degrees are actually going to make
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.580]   them successful humans. They come out miseducated
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:03.820]   and undereducated and incapable of servicing the economy's needs. Separately, the other thing,
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:08.620]   if you take a step back and take student loan off the table for a second and just say, "Any
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:17.800]   A consumer handout that touches less than 40 or 50% of the economy or of the population
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:22.220]   of a country is very precarious.
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:26.240]   Student debt, in this case, 15% of the US population, so a lot of people.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.980]   But it also means that there's 85% who don't benefit.
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:34.600]   What will those 85% of the people say when they have to foot the bill for the first 15%?
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.100]   Then what do you think happens with other kinds of debt?
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:42.460]   What happens when the oil lobby says, "Forgive our debt because we're in a national energy
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.460]   crisis."
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.460]   What will all the climate folks think about that?
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:46.460]   No accountability.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:47.460]   It's no accountability.
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:48.460]   It's unfair.
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:50.500]   Well, it creates a slippery slope.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:56.080]   My last point on this is, to the extent that we actually want to forgive student debt,
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.700]   I'm fine if that's the law of the land.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:58.740]   That's great.
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:03.420]   It should go to the floor and it should be debated in Congress and it's a law that should
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:07.580]   be passed, but it should not be by executive edict trying to back in—
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.620]   To buying votes in a midterm election.
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:10.620]   It's gross.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:11.620]   Sachs, until the end—
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:14.540]   Well, by the way, just on the politics of that, I think this could potentially hurt
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:19.760]   them because, Chamath, to your point, this is basically a bailout of the woke professional
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.760]   class.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:25.720]   It's the underemployed graduates of these universities who, again, are members of the
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:26.960]   professional class.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.340]   They majored in things that didn't increase their earnings potential.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:33.340]   Meanwhile, the majority of the country is working class.
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:37.060]   Something like two-thirds of the country is still working class, meaning non-college educated.
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.340]   They're going to have to pay for this bailout.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:44.680]   In one way or another, either through higher taxes or more deficit spending or more debt,
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.680]   the burden of this bailout is going to fall on them.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:51.140]   Why should they have to pay to bail out this professional class?
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:55.800]   Literally, somebody working in retail is paying for somebody's graduate school degree in creative
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.800]   writing or something.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.540]   It's completely and profoundly unfair.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:04.280]   To the answer to Freberg's question, we actually know when executive function fully matures
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.140]   in adults, it's 25 years old.
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:06.180]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:06.500]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:06.540]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:11.980]   and that's when you can actually make long-term thinking. So, there is an argument that people
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:17.420]   should not be allowed to take these loans that are not even-- that you can't get out of,
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:22.380]   or there should be some cap on the amount of loans you can take because people at the age
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:27.340]   of 17, 18, 19, 20 are absolutely not able to make these decisions. There are other programs,
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:31.660]   as well, that work. So, in Canada, I went to a school called the University of Waterloo
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:35.660]   and… Fantastic engineering school. The reason I went there and I did electrical engineering
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:40.140]   there is that they had a program where after the first year-- so, the first year looks like every
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:46.300]   other year at every other school, okay? But you're there for two semesters from September to May.
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:51.900]   But after that, you start working and you alternate four months of work with four months of
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:57.900]   school. You get paid for that work and what it allowed me to do was graduate with meaningfully
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:03.980]   less debt, but it also allowed me to graduate with a commercial skill set. I was able to get a job.
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:10.140]   And in that moment, actually, I was working at a bank and I got profoundly lucky, which is I worked
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:16.700]   for an individual and I was trading interest rate derivatives and I was learning to trade
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:23.580]   technology stocks on the side. And this guy, Mike Fisher, incredible human being, and I made in one
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:27.980]   year like $25,000 or $30,000 for him. Yum, yum. Zip, zip.
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:32.140]   He wrote me a check and he said, "Here, you have $25,000 of student debt. Go pay it off right now.
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:32.780]   I'll let you cash out this whole book." How much did you--?
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:32.780]   I graduated with about $20,000. Yeah.
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:36.380]   This whole book. I graduated with about $28,000 of debt.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:41.260]   I had about $8,000, I think. I had somewhere between $10,000 and $15,000,
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:46.540]   $10,000 and $20,000. And then I got my first bonus check after my first year of work after
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:50.300]   undergrad and I paid off all my debt and it felt incredible.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:53.180]   Incredible. It was amazing. When I paid off my debt,
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:57.020]   I've never been in debt since. I walked downstairs to the bank and
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:01.900]   I gave them the check and I endorsed it and I said, "Here's my student loan number." And I was like, "Oh, my God.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:06.780]   I was free." It was an enormous sense of relief.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.980]   For me, it was credit card debt. I had accumulated all the credit card because I went to Cal. It was
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:12.940]   like four grand a year to go to Cal. It was a lot cheaper back then.
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:17.020]   If I didn't go to Waterloo, I would have had double the debt because I wouldn't have had work.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:21.500]   But then also, I think about all these scenarios, I wouldn't have had two years of work experience.
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:25.820]   I may not have gotten the job that I did at Bank of Montreal at the time. That may not have been able
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:31.420]   to give me a chance to meet Mike Fisher. All these things could have happened. You can't rely on the
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:35.820]   luck of the butterfly effect so that you have a reasonable shot of building a good life.
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:41.100]   There are all these things in universities that I think are really mismanaged today,
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:45.660]   and they go and work against what is right in society. I'll give you another example.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.980]   The dean of the engineering school and the president of University of Waterloo was here
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:55.500]   this week with me. I asked them, "Tell me about these global rankings." They said,
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:09:00.940]   "You know, it's just a really difficult game." They said, "If we wanted to compete to try to get high on the list,
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:07.580]   we would have to do the things that would undo all the things that made us great and unique in the first place."
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:08.380]   Right.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:13.660]   I was like, "You know what? I am such a huge supporter of this school. Please just continue to do what you're doing."
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:17.180]   I'm so proud that they have the strength to just stand on their own two feet.
[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:24.140]   But every other school is running this shell game of gerrymandering all of these statistics,
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:30.460]   trying to get high on the list, to trick some parent, to force their kid to go to some school, to then graduate,
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:36.620]   with $200,000 of debt, to get a job that doesn't then give them any line of sight to paying it off.
[01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:42.140]   I don't think it's their kids' fault, but you have to reform the system.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:46.620]   I think the first thing you need to do is look inside these universities and hold these folks accountable.
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:51.900]   These incentive systems are just crazy.
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:56.300]   Speaking about crazy, we talked about Bill Wang and his—
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:59.980]   That's your transition? That's your transition?
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:03.420]   They can't all be as elegant and smooth.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:07.100]   Here's Jake Howell. He's looking at the agenda for today, and he sees Bill Huang,
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.780]   and he's like, "Okay, how do I do this? How do I do this?"
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:09.900]   The Huang-er. The Huang-er.
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:13.980]   Yeah. Okay. Crazy. Crazy. The linkage is craziness. Okay, go.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:18.460]   No, no, no. No, no, no. Hold on. The linkage is trillions and billions.
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:19.340]   Trillions and billions.
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.700]   Speaking of trillions and billions—
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.700]   Speaking of trillion-dollar mistakes—
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:23.900]   We got a—
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:29.500]   Bill Wang and his CFO were arrested on Wednesday in charge with racketeering, wire fraud, and conspiracy—
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.740]   We talked about this when it happened.
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:35.500]   His firm, Archegos—
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.420]   Archegos. Archegos. Archegos.
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:38.060]   Archegos.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:41.100]   Archegos. His poorly-named firm and family office—
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:44.140]   We covered this in real time back on episode 28.
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:51.740]   They famously lost $20 billion over two days when they were margin-called back in March of 2021.
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:54.300]   He worked at Tiger Management, yada, yada.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:59.020]   And it was at the time reported that they were trading—
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.820]   Billions of dollars at over 5x leverage.
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:07.100]   According to the SEC complaint, at its peak, the firm was managing $36 billion
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.940]   with $160 billion of exposure, which is 4.5 times leverage.
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:16.220]   But Archegos, or whatever it's pronounced, started with only $1.5 billion in assets
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:18.860]   in March of 2020.
[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:24.780]   So Wang flipped $1.5 billion in capital into $160 billion of exposure in 12 months,
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:28.540]   essentially trading somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 to $1 at its peak,
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.060]   according to this complaint.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:34.780]   A bunch of banks have lost money because they were supporting this.
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.620]   Credit Suisse lost $5.5 billion.
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.140]   Morgan Stanley lost $1 billion.
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:41.180]   UBS, $774 million.
[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:45.500]   The New York Times described it as, quote, "orchestrating a stock manipulation scheme
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:50.780]   that relied on them masking and concealing the enormous risk they had taken."
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:52.940]   Chamath, you had some thoughts on this, I think.
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:57.340]   So first, I think we should probably explain how he did this, right?
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:57.580]   Yes.
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:57.660]   So—
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:58.060]   That's—
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:01.020]   That's everybody's question, is how did the banks let this happen?
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:01.500]   So explain.
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:04.380]   Well, I think first, it's what's the mechanism?
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:09.340]   So there are ways in capital markets to take really extreme bets.
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:15.020]   This way is what's called a total return swap.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:20.620]   And so the basic way that this works is you have two people on each side of a trade.
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:27.580]   And what you basically say is, let's agree on what's called a reference asset.
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:28.940]   So I'll just use an example.
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:34.220]   Let's just say it's—I think Discovery was one of the companies that they were trading.
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.660]   So Discovery Communications.
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:38.060]   Let's look at—that's the reference asset, that stock.
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:43.340]   And what I'm going to do is buy protection.
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:47.980]   And what you're going to do is sell protection.
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:55.100]   And essentially what happens is, as the stock goes up and down, you're going to net the
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:57.100]   difference between these two people.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:03.740]   And when you do it that way via a derivative—so what it forces the person to do, the bank
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:07.340]   in this case, is to go out and buy the stock, okay?
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:12.940]   Show that they are hedged in case the price goes up a lot because they have to pay that
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:16.300]   difference, in this case, to Bill Hwang.
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:22.780]   And if the price goes down, Bill Hwang has to pay that difference back to the bank.
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:26.620]   So what happened is that he went to three different banks.
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.300]   Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Credit Suisse.
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:33.660]   And effectively what he did was he bought—he made these bets across a handful of names.
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:39.740]   But he did it with so much leverage that he ended up owning 60 or 70% of some of these
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:40.220]   companies.
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:46.460]   And in March of last year, when the stock market turned over, he owed them enormous
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:52.220]   amounts of money, so much so that these banks had to unwind these trades, which caused further
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:56.140]   downdrafts of the stock market.
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:14:00.220]   And so the stock market went through a lot of these downdrafts in the stock and almost
[01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:02.220]   spilled over to the broader stock market.
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:06.220]   Jason, the numbers from the SEC complaint are pretty crazy.
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:14.620]   As of March 31st of 2020, they had $1.6 billion invested on a gross exposure of $10.2 billion.
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:21.340]   What that means is they were able to go and lever up this $1.6 billion to behave in the
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:23.820]   market as if they had $10.2 billion.
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:25.660]   By January 1st of 2021—so nine months later—
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.980]   they had $7.7 billion of invested capital.
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:31.740]   So they'd done really well, right?
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.740]   They'd made 70% on this $10 billion.
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:39.100]   But they levered that up again, and so they had gross exposure of $54 billion.
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:48.380]   And then just, I think, three months later, by March 22nd, they had $36 billion of invested
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:50.780]   capital, meaning they had $36 billion of cash.
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:55.180]   This guy had taken $1.6 billion and spun it up to $36 billion in investment.
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:55.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:55.740]   And basically—
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:56.140]   Yum, yum.
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:57.420]   This guy went like 20x.
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:58.220]   In a year.
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:04.940]   But then he had levered that up again, and he had $160 billion of gross exposure.
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:09.740]   And then the market turned, and he owed all this money, and so all these folks had to get out of it.
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:13.660]   But they also allege that he was trying to do short squeezes on the stocks to try to make them
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:14.700]   goose even more.
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:17.500]   So there was massive manipulation because of his position size, correct?
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:17.740]   Yes.
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.020]   So this is what happened.
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:21.100]   But then here's how it is allowed to happen.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:24.860]   So if you try to do the same thing in interest rates,
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.300]   in the interest rates market versus the equities market, it's not possible.
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:28.700]   Why?
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:33.500]   If I wanted to go and buy a credit default swap, effectively think of that as the same
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:37.100]   kind of thing he did, but on the debt of a company, on the debt of Discovery.
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:42.940]   What I would do is I would be able to enter into that trade with a bank, but it goes into
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:43.660]   a clearinghouse.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:50.140]   And that clearinghouse is able to tell all the banks how much risk is building up in
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:50.620]   the system.
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:54.380]   And the reason we implemented this clearinghouse was to make sure, because we're going to
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:58.380]   make sure coming out of the great financial crisis, none of that chaos ever happened again.
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:03.820]   But we did not include the equity markets in that clearinghouse and in the laws that
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:04.300]   regulate it.
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:10.780]   So what this is is a very shadowy gray part of the market that is poorly regulated, that
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:11.980]   has very little oversight.
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:13.100]   So what do the banks do?
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:18.380]   The banks say to you, if you want to put this thing on, give me a balance sheet so I understand
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:19.020]   what the risk is.
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:21.580]   A piece of paper, a report.
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.660]   And I think what they're alleging
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:29.580]   is that these guys lied so that any individual bank, in this case Goldman, Morgan, and Credit
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:33.580]   Suisse, had no idea because they kind of doctored these reports to each other.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:36.620]   And that's why all this risk built up in the system.
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:40.860]   It would be solved if you had a clearinghouse for equity derivatives the same way you have
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:41.660]   for interest rate derivatives.
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:47.660]   It is crazy to think that somebody was doing this and thought they would get away with
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:49.660]   it and had been up 20x.
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:53.500]   The psychology of these people, the Madoffs of the world, I just find, I don't know, I'm
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:54.300]   just fascinated.
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:55.740]   I mean, why wouldn't he if he had 20x?
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:17:01.740]   We just thought, by the way, we talked about how the four of us are grinding to return
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:03.420]   2x of our money in 10 years.
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:03.920]   Yes.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.580]   And this guy's like YOLO.
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:11.180]   He's 7x or 10x, 1.6 billion dollars, and it was not enough.
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:12.380]   It's not enough.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:12.620]   It's insane.
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:15.980]   I mean, people have-- I mean, what do you think the psychology of this is?
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:18.380]   I have no idea.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:19.740]   That's what I'm trying to figure out, Sachs.
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:22.620]   What's the psychology of somebody who tries to do this?
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:22.660]   I'm not even gonna try to figure out Sachs.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:22.900]   I'm not even gonna try to figure out Sachs.
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:22.940]   I'm not even gonna try to figure out Sachs.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:23.260]   I'm not even gonna try to figure out Sachs.
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:24.460]   They're already a billionaire.
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:25.900]   They've already got their jet.
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:26.700]   They could go anywhere.
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:27.740]   They could have anything.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:29.420]   They could buy any home.
[01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:30.780]   They could go on any vacation.
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:33.900]   That's the thing I never understand about these people is like,
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:37.580]   this has got to be some crazy sociopathic behavior.
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.500]   Jekyll, did you always want a jet?
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.340]   By the way, the guy--
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:43.980]   I just got a business select on Southwest.
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.740]   When you started your career, what did you want?
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:47.020]   The Knicks.
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:48.380]   That's what I still want.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.220]   Well, when you started, you wanted a house, right?
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:53.020]   And then you got the house and you wanted the home in Tahoe, and then you--
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.460]   You want the Knicks.
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:56.780]   The vacation home, and then you want the jet.
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:59.580]   And then, I mean, I don't know why this is confusing.
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:05.340]   Well, no, but I don't want it enough to put my entire freedom at risk or to cheat.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:06.780]   Apparently, this dude was a Christian.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:08.780]   I'll put that in quotes because I don't-- I mean, I don't know.
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:09.980]   Doesn't sound like Christian behavior, bro.
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:12.380]   Ran Bible study and stuff in the mornings.
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:14.780]   He lived in some modest house in Jersey, blah, blah, blah.
[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:17.820]   But he was a bit of a freaky deke.
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:18.380]   What does that mean?
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:19.420]   So weird.
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:20.940]   I mean, the guy couldn't get enough.
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:23.020]   By the way, the dude was pinched in two.
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:26.620]   2012 for insider trading and had to pay a settlement and might give back everybody's
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:27.100]   money.
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:28.140]   He got pinched.
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:28.860]   It's crazy.
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:29.740]   And it is what it is.
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:31.260]   You know, you never ran on your friends.
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:31.900]   I got pinched.
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:32.940]   He got pinched.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:33.900]   Yeah, he got pinched.
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:35.580]   When you grow up in the streets, you know that.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:36.380]   What happened to this guy?
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:37.180]   I got pinched.
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:37.660]   He got pinched.
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:38.940]   When you grew up in the streets.
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:39.740]   The guy ate cheese.
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:40.300]   He didn't run out.
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.420]   He ratted on his friends.
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:42.860]   He ran out of the Medjigo.
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:43.740]   He tried to steal some Medjigo.
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:44.140]   He got pinched.
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:45.100]   And he ratted on his friends.
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:46.460]   Now the CFO got pinched too.
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.220]   They flipped him.
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:51.020]   This is super deranged.
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:51.900]   Speaking of deranged.
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:55.900]   Transitions.
[01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:56.780]   Where are we going?
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:57.660]   Where are we going?
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.260]   You know what someone needs to do?
[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:03.020]   Someone needs to take all of JCal's transitions from the last couple of shows and just put
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:03.980]   them together in a row.
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:05.020]   Yeah, just a supercut.
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:05.420]   Speaking of crazy.
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:06.540]   Speaking of deranged.
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.140]   Okay, speaking of deranged.
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:08.460]   Yeah.
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:11.340]   On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:12.300]   Speaking of billions.
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:16.300]   Announced a disinformation governance board.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:17.740]   Disinformation governance board.
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:21.820]   According to the announcement, the board will immediately, immediately begin focusing on
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:21.820]   millions.
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:25.260]   Misinformation aimed at migrants at the US Mexican border.
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:30.140]   The board will be led by disinformation expert Nina Jankiewicz.
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:34.940]   He has researched Russian misinformation tactics and online harassment.
[01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:37.980]   This is also the woman who sings show tunes on TikTok.
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:42.460]   JCal, I feel like you should be running our disinformation board.
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:43.820]   You always have such a strong opinion.
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:47.020]   You have such a nose for what's BS and what's not.
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.300]   Here's what's going on here.
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:51.740]   So first of all, this woman claims to be an expert in disinformation.
[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:53.180]   Let's evaluate that claim.
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:59.260]   She was an active pusher of the Steele dossier, which turns out is disinformation for which
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:00.700]   people are now under indictment.
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:06.140]   She also was active in trying to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story, which as it now
[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.420]   turns out was not disinformation.
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:10.940]   It was absolutely true as acknowledged by the New York Times, the Washington Post.
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:16.380]   You would think that these blemishes on her record might disqualify her from being an
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:21.340]   expert on disinformation, but actually in the view that people are hiring her, these are
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:21.660]   actually good.
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.540]   They're actually qualifications because they are not interested in the truth.
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:29.740]   The reason this department is set up and what they mean by disinformation is they have hired
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:32.220]   her to push partisan political points.
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:33.420]   That's what's going on here.
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:34.620]   That's what disinformation is.
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:39.500]   Now, it used to be that if you disagreed with somebody, you just say, listen, I disagree
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.980]   with you or maybe you're an idiot, whatever, you're wrong.
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:46.940]   But now the way that these debates are set up and the way they work is they don't just
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:48.460]   say you're wrong or that's not true.
[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:51.580]   They try to label you as disinformation so you can get you censored.
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:57.900]   And the point of hiring this disinformation czar is basically to censor the disinformation,
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:59.260]   basically to shut down the debate.
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:02.220]   That is basically the whole point of the censorship.
[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:05.020]   Do you think there's any timing here with Elon by Twitter?
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:05.820]   Yes, of course.
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:09.980]   There was a great tweet about this.
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:11.980]   I mean, I love conspiracy sacks, by the way.
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:13.500]   I don't think it's conspiracy theory.
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:18.620]   There was a great tweet about this that we live in a future where it's like a mashup
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:20.860]   of George Orwell and Ayn Rand.
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:21.500]   Because here you are.
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:27.660]   You have Elon Musk, the heroic lone entrepreneur trying to rescue freedom of speech.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:31.500]   At the same time, you have this Orwellian ministry of truth being created by the federal
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:31.900]   government.
[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:33.740]   I mean, no awareness of naming.
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:35.020]   Yeah.
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:35.820]   It's just bizarre.
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:37.580]   But the disturbing thing about it is-
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:40.380]   Disinformation governance board is such a dystopian name.
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:45.820]   The thing about it that's a little bit scary here, I know you play the video of her doing
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:50.540]   show tunes and it seems sort of silly, but the thing that's scary is that this is under
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:51.420]   the homeland.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:52.620]   Homeland Security Department.
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:53.980]   That's another weird wrinkle.
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:54.940]   Why is that there?
[01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:58.140]   It's the most militarized department in our government.
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:02.300]   So it's really scary to put the ministry of truth under the department that has all the
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:03.020]   soldiers and all the weapons.
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:06.060]   Ministry of truth is not the name of it, but it's close.
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:06.860]   Pretty darn close.
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.060]   Now, why is it there?
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:08.780]   I'll tell you why.
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:10.540]   Because this was built up to.
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:12.140]   Ministry of truth.
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:13.100]   Shout out George Orwell.
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:17.660]   A couple of months ago, there's a news story that we might have covered on this pod
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:21.340]   where the Homeland Security Department redefined
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:23.820]   disinformation to comprise.
[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:27.740]   They said it represented an escalation of the terror threat level.
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:31.900]   So in other words, they basically said that this information was tantamount to terrorism.
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:32.620]   Remember that?
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:34.140]   Didn't we talk about that?
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:35.900]   This is the payoff to that.
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:37.260]   First, they define.
[01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:42.540]   They basically define the other side as being disinformation of the debate as being disinformation.
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:45.980]   Then they define disinformation as basically terrorism.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:50.540]   Then they have the Homeland Security Department, which is supposed to be responsible for terrorism.
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:51.260]   Create this ministry.
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:51.980]   Of truth.
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:53.020]   This is what's going on here.
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:53.820]   It's really weird.
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:57.820]   Just to remind everyone there was concern in the last election.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:01.100]   I'm going to play devil's advocate as I often find myself doing here.
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:04.540]   That just to try and explain the world.
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.100]   That's the reason I often play this role because I try to understand the world.
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:16.300]   But there was a real concern that the Russian government was using information warfare and
[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:20.060]   propaganda through social media proven to influence voting.
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:26.460]   And that that is considered a security threat to the integrity of our elections.
[01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:29.820]   Therefore, this is a homeland security issue.
[01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:34.460]   And there is a question mark, of course, that everyone has on how far they're going to go.
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:39.260]   Once you set this precedent, when would they ever stop in terms of quote unquote policing
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:44.780]   information and policing what's true and managing internal propaganda and internal media delivered
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:45.820]   to us by the government?
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.180]   That's the other side of the coin.
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:51.100]   But the primary side of the coin, the initial side, the initial representation that I'm
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:57.100]   that I think folks do have concerns around is how do we keep foreign actors from creating
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:01.740]   misinformation campaigns that go viral and influence elections and sex?
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:04.460]   I don't know if you think that that's a concern we should or shouldn't have, but how would
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:05.980]   you address it if you were the president?
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:09.580]   And that was the challenge to like, how do we stop that from happening?
[01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:14.300]   The foreign actors interfering in our elections is certainly a concern we should have if it
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:17.980]   was actually happening on a big scale or in a meaningful way.
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:18.460]   There's the qualifier.
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:21.020]   I mean, this is basically look, this is basically a hoax.
[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:21.820]   Okay.
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:25.580]   John Durham is basically out there making indictments right now, proving the extent
[01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:26.700]   of this hoax.
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:31.500]   It started with the whole Steele dossier, which was a piece of campaign opposition research
[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:34.620]   that was manufactured by Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:37.580]   The lawyers who basically produced it are under indictment.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:41.100]   And that's where this whole thing of Russian disinformation came from.
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:46.380]   And the only proof for that thesis is that supposedly the Russians bought $100,000 of
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:48.460]   Facebook ads on Facebook.
[01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:50.940]   So I'm not denying that that occurred, but it was,
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:52.060]   it was relatively minor.
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:55.580]   It was a drop in the bucket of all the activity going on around the last election.
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:59.020]   Wait, wait, to be clear, to be clear, that was just the ads that were bought with,
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:01.980]   with like credit cards that said like FSB on it.
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:04.780]   Like, but who way to go Facebook security team?
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:08.460]   You probably, you know, didn't count all the number of credit cards that were stolen.
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:11.580]   I'm pretty sure the Russians are capable of stealing John Smith's credit card and using
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:12.460]   that to buy ads as well.
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:13.820]   Well, I looked at those ads.
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:14.780]   I used to see those ads.
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:15.740]   They were ludicrous.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:17.580]   They weren't going to convince anybody of anything.
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:20.860]   I mean, they had like Jesus and the devil.
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:22.140]   arm wrestling each other.
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:27.900]   And the Jesus figure was basically set and the, the, you know, it was just absurd.
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:29.100]   I mean, the Jesus figure was saying that.
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:29.260]   Okay.
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:33.020]   Wait, to be clear, it happened and you've now stepped back your position on like, it
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.180]   just wasn't at scale to your opinion.
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:41.420]   I think, I think, look, the, the scale interference in the election was committed by big tech.
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:45.820]   I mean, they censored the Hunter Biden story two weeks before the election.
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:49.980]   It turns out that's a completely true story that Hunter Biden has extensive business dealings
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:52.060]   with the president.
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:55.660]   And that's not just in Ukraine, the country we are now.
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:55.980]   Yes.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.700]   But we are now deeply involved in a war there.
[01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:02.540]   And that story, the electorate had the right to take that into account.
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:03.900]   Big tech censor that story.
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:05.100]   There was a reason for that.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:06.220]   May I respond to that?
[01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:09.580]   Just to give people like making a very difficult decision.
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:14.620]   You have to remember Trump asked Putin on stage to hack Hillary's emails and they did.
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:19.820]   Then he asked the Ukraine to take action against the Bidens or he wouldn't give them support.
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:20.700]   He was impeached for that.
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:24.780]   If you put yourself in the, and I'm not saying Twitter made the right decision here, but there
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:29.500]   was, and there was also sexual material, you know, people's nudes, which, and hacked material and
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.740]   nudes are against the terms of service.
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:34.460]   So I think two things happened concurrently.
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:37.980]   One, listen, the people working at Twitter are 98% liberal.
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:38.620]   They don't want Trump.
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.780]   They saw it as an existential threat.
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:43.660]   And then two, they don't want to link to hacked material.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:44.700]   Oh, really?
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:45.580]   Well, hold on a second.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:45.900]   Hold on.
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.180]   During the whole Canadian trucker.
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:48.380]   Let me finish this point.
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:49.660]   No, I have to finish my point.
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:50.140]   The third point.
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:50.620]   And then I'll let you go.
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:51.100]   I'll let you go.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:55.500]   Is that in addition to all that Hunter Biden is completely a grifter.
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:55.980]   Go.
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:56.380]   Okay.
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:57.260]   I agree with you on that one.
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:02.300]   So look during the whole Canadian trucker thing, remember when all the people who contributed
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.940]   to those Canadian truckers, they got docs.
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:09.180]   I mean, basically there was a hacker who leaked all the people who had donated and social
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.260]   networks were happy to print all that information.
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:15.660]   So this idea that they censor hacked information is nonsense.
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:20.540]   The lives of TikTok account just got docs by Taylor Lorenz look, whether you think that was a
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:21.660]   good idea or not.
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:25.500]   The point is these principles are invoked very selectively when there's a story they
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:29.820]   want to suppress and the New York times and the Washington post have both not come out
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:31.420]   and said that the laptop was real.
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:32.620]   It's been authenticated.
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:33.580]   The story was real.
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:37.500]   And this whole idea that it was disinformation that was just invented.
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.020]   I mean, it was just invented.
[01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:40.060]   Well, no hacked.
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:43.340]   It wasn't that it was just a ratio that it was potentially hacked and you, and Trump
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:44.620]   nothing was hacked.
[01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:45.180]   Here's the thing.
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.620]   Trump set the stage for that.
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:50.460]   And the, uh, the, the people at Twitter and Facebook.
[01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:51.980]   Who also made these decisions.
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:56.540]   They were informed by three later agencies, department of justice and, and FBI, et cetera.
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:59.420]   Hey, this is potentially hack material designed to interfere with the election.
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:04.940]   Listen, it also is true that Biden is a jank events and other democratic party operatives
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:07.180]   just made up out a whole cloth.
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:09.260]   That the hunter Biden's story was disinformation.
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:09.980]   It was true.
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:11.420]   It's been acknowledged as true.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:12.460]   The Washington post is true.
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:13.980]   I mean, I think this is true.
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:14.620]   So hold on.
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:15.580]   So it goes to my point.
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:16.620]   Can improve.
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:17.980]   No, it's not about improving it.
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:19.820]   Look, well, no, no, I, you didn't fear my sentence.
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:20.380]   I think this is where.
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:24.780]   Social media can improve, which is if they had to explain every one of these decisions,
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:27.020]   they make in full in transparency.
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:30.620]   I think that's something Elon could bring to this party, which is if you're going to
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:33.340]   block something, we need to know why.
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:37.500]   And they'd never explain why and who made the decision.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:41.340]   And I think that that transparency would benefit situations like this.
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:45.660]   If the DOJ or FBI told them, this is hacked material.
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:48.460]   Then they got to go to the DOJ and say, Hey, you got to give us cover here.
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:50.300]   If this is in fact hack material, you
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:51.260]   told us not to print it.
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:55.260]   We're not going to print it, but it was just bizarre that one publication
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.540]   got dinged like the New York post.
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:57.020]   It didn't.
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:00.700]   It screamed on the old newspaper in America, the oldest newspaper in America.
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:03.100]   It's also not the bastion of like, it doesn't matter.
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:04.140]   That's not for you to decide.
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:05.180]   It's not for Twitter to decide.
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:07.340]   It's a legitimate publication that had a true story.
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:07.900]   And I don't disagree.
[01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:10.540]   And it was relevant to the election and the American people should have been able to take
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:11.500]   that into account.
[01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:16.460]   And people like Nina Jankovic or whatever, our new czar of the ministry of truth.
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:20.220]   She was out in the forefront, basically calling that story disinformation.
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:22.860]   Meanwhile, she's pushing the steel dossier, which really was.
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:25.020]   I think if that story was confirmed, would Biden have won?
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:26.380]   I don't know.
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:29.980]   I don't know the answer to that, but the point is that it shouldn't have been suppressed.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:31.900]   That was, that was election interference.
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:39.100]   Now, Elon came out this week and specifically tweeted that, that that was basically a mistake.
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:39.980]   Bad call.
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:41.100]   Jack also said it was a bad call.
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.140]   Jack said it was a mistake too.
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:44.780]   And Elon repeated the same thing that they shouldn't have done that.
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:46.940]   I think everybody can agree it's a bad call in hindsight.
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:47.740]   Yeah, of course.
[01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:49.340]   In hindsight.
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:50.140]   Right.
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:52.300]   But what was the reaction to what Elon said?
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:58.940]   He was accused by virtue of criticizing the policy decision that Twitter made,
[01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:04.540]   that that was supposedly targeted harassment of the legal counsel at Twitter who made the decision
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:07.340]   who gets paid $17 million a year to make those decisions.
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:08.300]   Do you guys see this debate?
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:10.700]   This happened last year, this last week.
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:17.100]   So the point is that if you criticize somebody who's on a certain side of the debate,
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:20.060]   that's harassment, but he'd even mentioned her
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:20.860]   by name.
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:23.100]   This is how absurd this discourse has gotten.
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:24.220]   Can I make a prediction?
[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:25.500]   Yes.
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:26.220]   Prediction's great.
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:32.300]   I think people misunderstand Elon's incentives for buying Twitter.
[01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:37.420]   I haven't talked to him about this, so I'm just making a complete subjective prediction.
[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:40.300]   I think he's going to buy Twitter.
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:43.660]   I think he's going to clean it up.
[01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:48.460]   I think he's probably going to generate something like a 2x on this.
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:49.980]   We talked about how that's like a 2x.
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:53.900]   I think he's going to do something like a good terminal valuation in six or seven years
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:56.940]   that basically puts that asset worth at around $100 billion.
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:31:01.580]   In the meantime, he's going to open source as much as possible.
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:06.140]   I think he's going to make it very difficult for misinformation and disinformation to get very far.
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:10.380]   He said he's going to authenticate every human being that uses the platform.
[01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:12.140]   He said all of these things publicly already.
[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:16.220]   Then here is the masterstroke, and again, this is just me speculating.
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:19.020]   I think he's going to donate it into a foundation and a trust.
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:21.580]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:22.940]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:23.980]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:24.940]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:25.980]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:26.940]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:27.980]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:28.940]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:29.980]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:30.940]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:31.980]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:33.020]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:35.020]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:35.980]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:37.020]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:38.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:39.020]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:40.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:41.100]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:42.140]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:43.180]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:44.300]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:45.420]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:46.540]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:47.660]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:48.780]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:50.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:54.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:56.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:58.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:00.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:02.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:04.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:06.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:08.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:10.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:12.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:14.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:16.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:18.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:20.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:22.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:24.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:26.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:28.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:30.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:32.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:34.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:36.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:38.060]   I think he's going to do something like a 2x.
