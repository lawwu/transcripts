[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360]   Hey, everybody, Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. It is the end
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.480]   of 2022. And once again, we're doing our bestie awards. Yes, at
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.360]   the end of the year, we do our bestie awards. This is where we
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.320]   give awards to the biggest winners, losers, and many other
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760]   categories that you love with me again, of course, the Sultan of
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.280]   science, deep in his Kurosawa vibes. How are you doing,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.760]   Sultan? It was great to see you guys for dinner last night,
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.920]   Saks, we missed you. That was a lot of fun. We all got together
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.520]   twice this week for dinner while we were on vacation. And during
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.560]   our dinner, we took a vote and Saks you are now the director of
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.440]   the all in summit. Congratulations. Congratulations.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.680]   Yes, the grift is on my first act is to veto it. Okay, sorry,
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.160]   to the fans. Also with us, of course, is the dictator himself
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.160]   Chamath Palihapitiya deep in his turtleneck phase and his vibes
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.440]   tell us about your winter vibes, bestie.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.040]   I mean, I can't believe that we all took over Lake Tahoe for a
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.680]   week together. It's cool. It's been a lot of fun. I gotta say,
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.880]   Saks, you'll be surprised. J. Cal has the life hack of life
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.080]   hacks here. He's figured out how to basically get everything
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.040]   pre wired. All the restaurants all the reservations. It's been
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.600]   great. I've loved it. We've had a wonderful time. It's an
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.200]   eight person table for every night. And he does it what
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.000]   months in advance. So every night, he's got two weeks out,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.440]   I get a table vape for five, six nights in a row. And then I
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.920]   invite my besties out. And oddly, it turned out there was
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.240]   only one person from Jake outside. Yes. There was always a
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.840]   room for the rest of us to show. We had a wonderful time. I
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.720]   picked up the check for the nachos and Chamath brought $6,000
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.520]   worth of wine. I brought my own also to the restaurant yesterday
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.720]   so we could open the wine properly. It was wonderful.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.400]   We've had a wonderful time. And of course with us looks like he
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.720]   had to work over the Christmas break. Saks, how are you doing,
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.400]   brother? You working today? I'm good. I'm just hanging out
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.000]   somewhere. Well, come on. You could be honest. You're at the
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.800]   Twitter HQ. I recognize that incredible architecture and
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.240]   design. They spent so much money on that office space. Beautiful.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.720]   That's definitely beautiful office. They've got their own
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.320]   bespoke coffee shop here called the perch. We're the people that
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.560]   work there. Too soon. People are working too hard to be hanging
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.960]   on the coffee shop. Rain Man David Saks.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:51.080]   Okay, so let's get started with our bestie awards. This is very
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.560]   controversial. We start with a political award. And last year,
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.640]   you know, this is our just so we're clear, this is not the
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.640]   prediction show. That next week will be the prediction show.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.480]   This week is our winners. Cue the music. Yes, cue the music.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.160]   Right there. Okay, here we go. 2022 predictions. This is what
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.760]   we predicted for the bestie award for biggest political
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.240]   winner. I said Ron DeSantis and so did David Saks. We predicted
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.240]   in 20. After me, you said it after me. And the way you
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.800]   introduced it, you said, What did Tucker Carlson's writers
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.240]   come up with? I said DeSantis and then you said DeSantis. Are
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.840]   you starting already? Literally, I'm trying to give you your
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.160]   flowers. Okay, take it easy. You're gonna get your flowers.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.240]   So Ron DeSantis, obviously a big winner. So those were those were
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.960]   great predictions. freeberg. With a wildcard there. He
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.120]   predicted Putin would be a winner in 2022. That one fell a
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.080]   little flat. Did it not our friend freeberg? Not a winner?
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.440]   No, I think he, you know, I mean, my projection was really
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.920]   built on what I thought would be a big kind of influence that he
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.440]   would gain this year. You know, whether he's viewed negatively
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.520]   or positively, he's certainly at the center of the stage right
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.920]   now. Now, Chamath, your 22 prediction, this is your
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.880]   prediction last year for this year, was that the biggest
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.720]   political winner would be Xi Jinping. Okay. Now we go to our
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.440]   actual biggest winner. This is where we tell you who we thought
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.920]   was the biggest winner of 2022. Let's start with you, Saks. Who
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.760]   is your biggest winner for 2022? political biggest winner?
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.280]   This was the prediction that I nailed as you mentioned it. So
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.920]   the red wave fizzled everywhere else, but it crashed over
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.200]   Florida hard. So DeSantis is my pick. He won reelection by about
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.160]   20 points. And his coattails carried for new GOP house seats,
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.320]   which happens to be the exact size of the GOP majority.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.600]   Several polls have now shown him beating Donald Trump by
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.520]   significant margins for the 2024 GOP nomination. He is
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.320]   shattering fundraising records. Florida is now the fastest
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.360]   growing state. So he is my pick for the biggest winner,
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.520]   political winner of 2022. Great.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.080]   Who is your biggest political winner?
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.080]   Chama. I mean, it's obvious it's usually pink.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.040]   You know, there is no single person in the world that is now
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.360]   as powerful as this one man, he has complete authoritarian
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.400]   control over 1.2 odd billion people and 20% of the world's
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.520]   GDP and a large amount of the world's debt, including a lot of
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.640]   us dollar debt. And so you know, it's pretty, there's there's
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.960]   it's hard to find anybody that won nearly as much as he did.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.000]   Okay, now to you, Friedberg, who is your biggest political
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.760]   winner of 2022?
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.840]   I mean, I think your DeSantis and Jeejin ping calls were
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.240]   really like, good. I think the biggest surprising winner for me
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.920]   is like, you know, unexpected. And that would be Zelensky from
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.640]   the Ukraine. I don't think going into this year, people paid as
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.360]   much attention to him. He was certainly not a song hero. But
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.600]   coming through this conflict, and I think leading the
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.520]   storyline, about our common enemy of the West, and common
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.200]   enemy of democracy being Vladimir Putin, really kind of
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.680]   made him a superstar and a hero on a global stage. And I think
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.440]   that's evidenced by the fact that he's in the White House,
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.760]   and he gave an address to the US Congress yesterday. So I would
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.200]   make him kind of the biggest winner of the year.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.360]   It's hard to go against DeSantis. So, you know, he
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.480]   clearly has, as sacks correctly pointed out, gone into the lead,
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.800]   we'll see if he can be Trump in the primaries. I have my doubts.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.200]   But he does seem to be pulling in some of those moderates,
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.400]   right?
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.800]   I don't understand why you guys say he's a political winner.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.920]   What did he win? He hasn't won the nomination yet. He got
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.000]   reelected to a state that he had before 2022. So what did he win
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.440]   exactly?
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.320]   Well, I think a couple of things. One is when he won
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.600]   election to the governorship four years ago, it was by less
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.720]   than 1%. It was a tiny margin of victory. This was margin of
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.840]   almost 20%. He had coattails. And he is now the front runner
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.280]   for the GOP nomination in 24. I think you can argue you can make
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.160]   the case that maybe he's peaking too soon.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.440]   Well, I'm glad you brought that up. Because if you look at the
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:26.200]   data, you know, I think in the last seven or eight nomination
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.640]   cycles, the person that's been leading the popularity contest
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.760]   going into the Iowa caucuses has not won the nomination. He's
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.000]   peaking too soon almost.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.640]   That's a possibility. Because when you're the front runner,
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.800]   everyone takes shots at you. On the other hand, if he stays this
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.160]   dominant, he will drive out other contenders out of the
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.800]   primary, and he may be able to solidify it. And if it can just
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   be DeSantis versus Trump in the primary, he has a much better
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.720]   shot than if it's Trump versus a bunch of other challengers. And
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.280]   I think that if he continues to pull this well within the
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.440]   Republican Party, I think Trump might not run again, because
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.880]   Trump definitely does not want to risk being a loser in the
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.920]   Republican primary. So yeah, there's always front runner
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.640]   risk. But it's hard to say that coming out of this year, that he
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.040]   wasn't a huge political winner. Okay, if we're going to
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.880]   challenge other people's picks, I would maybe challenge
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.680]   Zelensky. There's no question that he's been a global media
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.240]   hero. But two thirds of Kiev is currently without power. 80% of
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.360]   Kiev doesn't have water. 30% of the Ukrainian power stations
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.840]   have been destroyed. Nearly half of the country's without power.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.760]   There's something like 8 million displaced Ukrainians in the
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.320]   country. And over 100,000 Ukrainians have been killed in
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.560]   this war. So yes, he's been a very strong charismatic war
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.240]   leader for them. But
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.760]   Friedberg your response, I'm not advocating for his performance
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   as a leader, I'm advocating for his accumulation of political
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.040]   goodwill. And that's it.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:05.440]   Okay, and he is winning the war. So is that winning? Well, in
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.520]   war, they say there, nobody wins. But it's certainly better
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.880]   than having your country taken over by Putin. So some would
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.280]   argue that's winning. Let's go to biggest losers, biggest
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.920]   losers. In 2022. We predicted again, this is our predictions
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.520]   from last year. And then we'll go on to our actuals for this
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.360]   year. Last year, we predicted, Chamath said the progressive
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.880]   left, SAC said Nancy Pelosi, Friedberg, you said us
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.240]   influence globally interesting. And I said the extremes, both
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.200]   Biden and Trump. Let's go with our predictions. I'm sorry, with
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.880]   our actuals for this year, Chamath wanted you go first this
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.800]   time, who is your biggest political loser for 2022?
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.560]   I mean, I don't think it's as written about as much but the
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:54.040]   progressive left did see as much failure as the MAGA, right. So
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.640]   they were a huge loser. I mean, to the extent that anybody
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.800]   thought that leftist, you know, quasi socialist policies and
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.480]   politics was a winning strategy. I think that was pretty soundly
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.920]   refuted, even in places that were pretty staunchly Democrat,
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.720]   it was really difficult for the progressive left to do much of
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.040]   anything but lose. So I think that was a really powerful and
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.560]   important repudiation. And I think it's marginalized as them
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.600]   to a bunch of, you know, kooks almost. And I think that that's
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.480]   really healthy for politics going forward.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.520]   So your prediction and your actual are going to be the same
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.640]   the last,
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.000]   I think they were the biggest political loser in the United
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.840]   States, at least.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.640]   Okay, yeah, Elizabeth Warren, we don't hear people talking about
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.560]   Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders much this year.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.600]   Yeah. And I think that the biggest political loser outside
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.480]   of the United States was probably the European Union.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.520]   Okay, you want to expand on that a little bit, if you just think
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.360]   about the corner that they painted themselves into how much
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.160]   they had to basically literally go 180 degrees away from what
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.720]   their policies were, you know, there was a huge raft of whether
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.280]   it was green, ESG, kind of woke liberal politics that manifested
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.840]   itself in all kinds of national security decisions and energy
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.760]   decisions that in this last year, they literally had to undo
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:18.040]   in order to stay alive. And that makes that whole political
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.600]   construct, I think, very fragile. So they were they were a
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.000]   pretty big political loser outside of the United States.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.320]   Okay, sacks. It'd be hard here to guess this one. But sacks,
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:34.520]   who is your biggest political loser in 2022? I have no idea
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.160]   who you're going to pick.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.040]   By the way, I got Pelosi right last year that she did lose the
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.400]   gavel. So you've got to say that the war in Ukraine was the
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.680]   biggest event of the year. And obviously, you can spread the
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.320]   blame around to a lot of people starting with Putin, because
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.280]   he's the one who ordered the invasion. But I would say this
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.520]   is a slightly different take on the category, which is biggest
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.400]   political blunder occurred on January 27 of this year, when
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.360]   Blinken said that NATO's door is open and must remain open. And
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.440]   that is our commitment. He basically shut the door. He kept
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.280]   NATO's door open, but shut the door on any means of a
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.840]   diplomatic off ramp to end this conflict by promising Russia,
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.360]   the Ukraine would not become part of NATO. That was the
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.800]   single biggest diplomatic blunder of this year, or maybe
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.000]   the last couple of decades, because there's a good chance we
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.240]   could have avoided this disastrous war, if we had just
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.880]   been willing to close NATO's door.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.360]   Wonderful. Great, crisp answer. Thank you for that nice and
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.680]   tight. Friedberg, who's your biggest political loser for
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.520]   2022?
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.200]   It was a tie for me between Jerome Powell, and Liz truss
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.200]   just has to get recognition here for only being in office for 45
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.160]   days as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. I mean, I think
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.120]   that is cannot be overlooked. The some of the policy and folks
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.400]   that she put in an office, caused, you know, massive chaos,
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.920]   it was just a clear dysfunction over a very short period of
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.480]   time. Jerome Powell, I think this was a big surprise this
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:09.400]   year, to see how the Fed chair became so politicized, and his
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.720]   role became so politicized, both kind of the left and the right,
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:19.480]   finding reasons to question his leadership, and his decision
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.240]   making the failure to raise rates soon enough, led to
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.840]   massive inflation is what you'll hear from one contingent of
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.640]   politicians and the public at large. And then the rate at
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.680]   which he's raising rates now to catch up to the common inflation
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.200]   is causing people to complain on the other side. So there is
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.560]   really no one that seems to be happy with Jerome Powell. And I
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.160]   think that that was a shooting star that seems to have
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.360]   completely lost its luster.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.720]   Okay, so the Fed, yes, good pull there. Okay, mine is pretty
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.000]   clear. And objectively, it is, of course, the GOP, the red wave
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.880]   failed, it turned into a trickle. Trump is back. And I
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.800]   believe there's a good chance he will win the primary Roe v. Wade
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.120]   a complete unmitigated disaster for Republicans, they caught
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.640]   the car and plus marriage equality and having to deal with
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.760]   that women and the LGBT community vote and they have long
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:17.640]   memories. The GOP, the biggest political losers for me. Okay,
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.960]   I'm sure sacks has no rebuttal there. So we will move on to the
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.240]   next category, which is
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.480]   by the way, if you say it that way, then you know, the biggest
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.040]   the biggest political loser in 2022 were women, like, like
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.120]   fundamental human rights were stripped away from 50% of the
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.800]   population. So that's not cool.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.160]   And they could have left it alone.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.280]   And they could have left it alone.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.160]   Well, if if what you mean is that the issue was sent to the
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.680]   states and each state then gets to decide, then you're right.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.120]   But but if you look at the battles have happened at the
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.520]   states, even red states like Kentucky and Kansas have
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.520]   rejected the subsequent political push to outlaw
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.080]   abortion. So it has not turned out to be
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.960]   just by the fact that all of these red states basically re
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.520]   confirmed and enshrined a woman's right to choose may
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.880]   actually go more to show that the Supreme Court is totally out
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.560]   of touch, and that they didn't need to touch Roe v. Wade. And
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.480]   the fact that they did opened up, you know, a huge can of
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.880]   worms in 50 states that now go and need to go and adjudicate
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.280]   this thing, where it looked like actually that decision, even
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.400]   back in the day, even though the way that it was done, you know,
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.040]   there was a lot of room for improvement, clearly, everybody
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.520]   agrees with that, but was actually after, you know, 50 plus
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.920]   years reasonable law. And so now that you took that law away, now
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.760]   folks, even in the red states are like, No, it was fine, which
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.240]   means that this whole thing was a huge political gambit more
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.840]   than it was actual societal intention.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.880]   Okay, so we are going to move on. Now. I just I'll add my
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.680]   final two cents to that. As I said, I do think women and the
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.680]   LGBT community have very long memories and the people who are
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.720]   in the moderate are not going to forget how they were treated by
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.320]   the GOP in this specific issue. So biggest political surprise,
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.960]   we didn't do predictions last year. But I'll just run down
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.840]   what everybody said was their political surprise. I said, the
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.320]   fact that Kamala Harris was sidelined was pretty surprising
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.880]   to me. And that's continued. Chamath, you said Joe Manchin
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.280]   was your biggest political surprise. Glenn yunkin winning
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.280]   sacks that was your biggest surprise. And Friedberg, the
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.720]   January six crowd, making it into the Capitol during the
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.280]   insurrection was your biggest political surprise. So here we
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.920]   go. Our 2022 biggest political surprise. Saks, let's start with
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.080]   you. You have a lot to say about politics go.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.640]   Well, the biggest political surprise to me was no red wave.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.760]   So I admit, I got this prediction wrong. You know, I
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.040]   got all my previous ones, right, Jay Klaus, I'm gonna admit I got
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.560]   this one wrong. You know, I believe that the electorate
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.800]   would focus on the fundamentals three quarters of the country
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.520]   thought were on the wrong track. Three quarters think we're in a
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.040]   recession. Nevertheless, the Republicans did not do nearly as
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.520]   well as predicted, they only gained nine seats in the House,
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.160]   they actually lost a seat in the Senate. And I think that that
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.400]   had something to do with candidate equality. And of
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.440]   course, the whole election denial narrative, basically was
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.360]   a disaster for them. I hope that the Republicans move on and stop
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.560]   talking about the past. What voters want to hear about is the
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.040]   future.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.080]   freeberg. Did you have a biggest political surprise for 2022?
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:29.560]   freeberg?
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.920]   Yeah, it's also the failure of the red wave. I mean, that was
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.440]   my, my pick. I think the consensus going into the
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.720]   election was with, you know, rising inflation and the disdain
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   that everyone had for the way politicians kind of managed us
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.120]   through COVID and then managed us through the economic recovery.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.960]   It's, it was inevitable to see a flip and it didn't happen. I
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.760]   think obviously, we talked about why that is, but that was a big
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.600]   surprise for everyone.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.800]   Chamath, what was your biggest political surprise of 2022?
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.080]   Chamath Palihapitiya?
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:04.040]   The absolute toothlessness of MAGA and Donald Trump. I mean,
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:09.360]   he was just a scarlet letter. If you were anywhere near this guy,
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:15.960]   you were gonna lose. And that's surprising, considering how
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.680]   traditional republicans were pandering to him, up until
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.720]   frankly, just a few months ago. So I think that we exposed the
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.920]   emperor of as having no clothes, and that he marginalizes and
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.440]   sidelines candidates into a fringe following that cannot go
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.800]   mainstream. That was a it was really surprising to see how
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.360]   stark that was this year.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:45.600]   Fantastic. I'm going to build on your Chamath. I had to hear
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.600]   number two was Roe v. Wade, but we've beaten that. I think it
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.160]   would just get us discussed it as much as we possibly could. My
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.320]   number one, building on your Chamath is that despite what's
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.560]   happened with Trump, the documents, the his cases in the
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.840]   United States in New York, and about taxes, despite all of
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.440]   this, the January 6 insurrection, despite all this,
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.720]   Trump is still viable. I can't believe he's still viable and
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.440]   that he is going to be out there in the primaries and he's going
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.880]   to have to debate to Santas and I don't know that to Santas can
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.080]   beat him in a debate. I think he might win. So this is completely
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.520]   scary for both me and sacks. I think it's terrifying. It's
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.680]   saxes nightmare and mine.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.440]   Well, I think he's mainly viable in the minds of the MAGA
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.160]   deadenders and the mainstream media who want to keep him
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.040]   alive. And the Biden administration wants to keep him
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.960]   alive. And they'll do anything to keep him alive and in the
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.720]   news and you love keeping him in the news. So it's a yes, it's a
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.360]   codependent relationship between the mainstream media, which you
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.400]   sometimes front for and Trump.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.440]   Be careful telling me what I think.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.160]   We need to end this codependency, J. Cal.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:57.560]   Well, I wish the Republican Party would finally take
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.000]   ownership of this disaster that is Trump and tell him that he
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.320]   has no business but you guys keep him in the game. And the
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.960]   fact that he's viable again, your personal nightmare and mine.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.040]   Okay, biggest business winner, everybody excited to get off
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.960]   politics right now and get to our kill zone, which is
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:18.160]   business. So last year, we had predictions in this category. I
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.120]   had said Disney, that's an up and down prediction. I'll get
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.920]   into that in a moment. Tremont, you said small and medium sized
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.360]   businesses, the old SMBs. SAC said rise of the rest the fly
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.600]   over states. And freeberg. You said stripe. Tremont. Let's
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.560]   start with you SMBs. What did you get? Right? What did you get
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.000]   wrong here?
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.160]   I mean, I whiffed it just completely missed the global
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:43.560]   macro shift that we embarked on in full force. Starting in q1 of
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.960]   this year, it was, it is the most important business story of
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.840]   the year. It's just like we have an absolute complete regime
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.040]   change. And by the way, that regime change is so complete.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   And so, you know, thorough that it even touched Japan just a few
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.280]   weeks ago, or sorry, just a few days ago, where Japan who find
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.360]   you know, finally yielded on this idea of, you're gonna we're
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.760]   gonna have negative interest rates and yield curve control,
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.120]   even they finally broken it and raised rates. So it is an
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:19.080]   absolute worldwide sea change in how we need to think about risk.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.040]   And I think that's worth talking about a little bit later in the
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.920]   show. But that was the single biggest business story of the
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.080]   yard, which must said I missed this too, even though on another
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.640]   prediction, when you asked what the biggest business loser would
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.680]   be, I think I said that it would be asset classes that had been
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.680]   pumped up by the feds money printing, because you start to
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.680]   feel now. So I got that part, right. But what I didn't
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.120]   connected to, were all the asset classes actually got pummeled. So
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.080]   I kind of conceptually understood that rates were
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.200]   rising, but I totally underestimated the magnitude of
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.880]   the shift, the way that growth stocks would get hammered the
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.520]   way that crypto would get destroyed the fact that like
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.920]   tiger basically got blown out of the industry. I mean, I had the
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.520]   right general intuition, but I didn't translate it into the
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.040]   specific asset types and the magnitude of the shift. And also
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.200]   the like what you must set a real regime change now, and how
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.480]   markets are viewing stock performance.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.080]   It's really incredible. freeburg. Let's get in on this.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.080]   This is somewhere where you can contribute deeply. What do you
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.840]   think about your take last year? And you still believe in stripe?
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.400]   Yeah, I mean, look, it's a it's a business that obviously
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.760]   benefited greatly from the pandemic and the adoption of,
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.800]   you know, the payment processing infrastructure that they've
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.640]   built across their across various kind of e commerce
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.240]   platforms. It's I've been I'm not an investor, so I don't have
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.320]   any numbers. But there are public reports that have
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.040]   highlighted that the revenue increased 66%. This year,
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.800]   they've indicated that they're probably going to experience
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.800]   significant revenue slowdown with the recession ahead. But it
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.560]   still seems like a super high quality business. And you know,
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.880]   valuation wise, who knows what things are going to be worth
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.360]   when they ultimately come to market. There's certainly no one
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.240]   going to going public right now. So at some point, we'll see, you
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.040]   know, whether valuations play out, but it seems like it
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.200]   continues to be a very strong, one of the strongest private
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.520]   businesses that's being built in Silicon Valley,
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.960]   we will get to 2022. biggest business winners in one second.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.600]   I will just say for Disney, yeah, man, what a swing, Bob
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.240]   chapik in and then out. And now Bob Iger back. So I feel like I
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.120]   got this one wrong and right. At the same time, I still believe
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.440]   in the company deeply. I think they're gonna have a big win.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:41.840]   Let's get to our actual biggest winner of 2022. Saks, why don't
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:45.360]   you lead us off with your biggest winner of 2022. For
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.000]   business,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.720]   I said Lockheed Martin, along with other defense stocks,
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.320]   Lockheed Martin, which makes javelins and high Mars is up 40%
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.400]   in the past year when most of the markets been way down. North
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.360]   or Grumman is also up almost 40%. And even some of the lesser
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.000]   performers like Raytheon and General Dynamics are up about
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.440]   almost 20% in a terrible market environment. The fact of the
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.760]   matter is war is terrible, but it appears to be good business.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.000]   We've sent so many weapons to Ukraine, that there's recent
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.480]   press reports that are the US stockpiles of missiles, javelins
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.080]   and stingers are now depleted. So these companies are going to
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.840]   keep doing well for the next year, at least. Now there's a
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.120]   new appropriation sailing through something like 44
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.800]   billion of new funding for the war. It's now over $100 billion.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.480]   McConnell says this is a Republicans number one priority.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.160]   This is now a bipartisan concern. And if you think the
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.720]   war is expensive, just wait for reconstruction that's estimated
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.160]   to cost roughly a trillion dollars to build Ukraine back.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.240]   Saks, can I ask you a question about that? Are these when we
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.720]   fund these wars? I've heard different versions of this can't
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.880]   get a clear answer. When we provide weapons and systems like
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.680]   this, are they not on account and we asked for money back at
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.760]   some point? Do you know the answer to that question?
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.160]   You think we're gonna get money back? Are you kidding me?
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.000]   It seems to be sometimes that we do. So that's why I was asking.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.800]   I think it's something there hasn't been clarity.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.440]   Look, I think the the war has been phenomenal business for the
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.360]   military industrial complex. That's what we're seeing here.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.600]   Not so great for us the economy.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.880]   freebird. What do you got? Yeah, I mean, I think you guys will
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.520]   remember last November, I predicted energy and defense to
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.520]   be the best performing
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.440]   stocks for this year. sax is right. I think defense is up 40%.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.520]   So I kind of went with the bigger oil and gas companies are
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.640]   up, you know, across the board about 47% in terms of equity
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.360]   value in the public markets a year to date, compared to the
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.160]   S&P being down about 20%. So over the short term, I would
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.640]   argue oil and gas companies, but I think that over the long term,
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.040]   there were a couple of big breakthrough moments that I would
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.680]   give kind of, you know, the winner in business that will
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.960]   benefit over the long term to open AI and to fusion startups.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.240]   And we'll talk more about why, for those two, obviously later
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.320]   when we get to the biggest winner in tech and science. But
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.600]   yeah, short term oil and gas, they benefited from the supply
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.360]   constraints and the conflict in the Ukraine. And the longer term,
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.680]   I think opening I infusion startups.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.840]   Well, and by the way, I mean, just just to give freebirth
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.640]   some credit here, you actually predicted the war or you
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.880]   predicted a war. I don't know if you predicted this war, but you
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.280]   predicted
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:24.760]   Yeah, I predicted the war and Putin kind of rising to the
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.400]   center stage and the defense dog.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.320]   That was a huge prediction, because I don't think most
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.760]   people even most analysts, well, they were surprised even when
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.560]   the invasion happened. I think people were still very surprised
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.360]   both that Putin would order it. But also, if you say the
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.640]   situation, I think you got to be surprised that we didn't
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.120]   negotiate harder to try and prevent it.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.160]   I traded it to I bought I bought an energy ETF. So it worked out
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:45.480]   for me.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.320]   Okay, Chamath, your biggest business winner of 2022.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.240]   Nick can throw it up. But it's basically any single person that
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.480]   understands the following formula. So if you this is the
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.040]   good, this is the this is the capital asset pricing model. So
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.720]   what is this? This is like before you make any investment,
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.200]   what it actually tells you is here's the rate of return that
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.640]   you need to generate above the risk free rate, in order for you
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.040]   to justify making that investment. And if you really
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.840]   understood the capital asset pricing model going into 2022,
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:24.040]   it would have been difficult for you to not make money. Because
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:28.200]   all of a sudden, as the 10 year flexed up, and as you know, the
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.120]   volatility, particularly of things like tech stocks, went
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.000]   crazy, you could have figured out where you to park your
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.200]   money. And all these people that have built businesses around
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.000]   this capital asset pricing model. So you have companies,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.200]   obviously, so you know, you have sectors of the economy, like
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:51.960]   defense, or energy stocks, consumer goods and staples, they
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.480]   all had moments where they all did well. But if you take it one
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.400]   step above the organizations that actually ran big macro
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.960]   books, or really understood how to algorithmically implement
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.280]   this capital asset pricing model just ran roughshod over the
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.560]   markets. And, you know, said in a different way, it's sort of my
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.640]   background, which is, you know, if you understood the capital
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.960]   asset pricing model, you would have been a massive bear. And
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.480]   the bear got fed this year to a degree that none of us could
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.240]   have anticipated.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.600]   Okay, so am I correct saying the capital asset pricing model is
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.280]   the biggest winner?
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.960]   Or no people that understood it.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.680]   People that understood it. Got it. Okay. And for my biggest
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.960]   winner, I went with chat GPT slash open AI and their partner
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.800]   Microsoft. Why did I pick that as the biggest winner? Well, on
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.960]   my other podcast this week in startups, we played a game chat
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:48.560]   GPT versus the first result of Google's and Molly and I could
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.080]   not tell the difference. And in fact, we picked chat GPT is
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.440]   answers often above Google's Google, one of the greatest
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.480]   businesses and franchises ever created has no answer at
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.880]   currently for chat GPT. Because Google's business model is to
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.560]   get you to click on an ad between links. If you give the
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.520]   actual answer, then the person doesn't stops clicking. If they
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.760]   stop clicking, Google stops making money, there is no
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.000]   business model in search, if the person gets their answer,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.640]   because they're done. This is an existential threat like we have
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.360]   not seen. And our friend Sam Altman has a line chat GPT
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:35.240]   slash open AI with Microsoft. Microsoft I think is going to
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.120]   release a and there's a prediction as well, a search
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:45.560]   engine with open AI that has a significant impact on Google's
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.800]   franchise. We didn't think this would ever happen. And it's
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.760]   here. Okay, the biggest losers in business. We made predictions
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.840]   last year. I said in 2020. I predicted in 2021. The biggest
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.320]   loser in 2022 would be crypto. By the way, Friedberg, you
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:05.160]   agreed with me. And we nailed it. You agreed with me? Well,
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.240]   yes, that's correct. We were in agreement. How about that? We
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.200]   were in agreement. We were in agreement. independent. You said
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.480]   a chamath visa slash MasterCard. We'll get into that. And sacks,
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.280]   you said asset classes benefiting from government
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.880]   pumps. Very interesting. The Fed stopping QE. Interesting.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.400]   Anybody have comments on their predictions or each other's
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.960]   predictions from last year?
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.520]   On a percentage basis? David absolutely nailed it. sacks
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.320]   absolutely nailed it. On a dollar basis, the biggest
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:38.720]   business loser of this year was big tech. And I think that you
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.040]   saw three things happen, which I think are important for the
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:49.360]   future. The first was it was the most crowded trade, both by
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.400]   professional money managers as well as retail. And that fever
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.160]   finally broke in the last half of in the second half of this
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.680]   year. And now going into, into these last few weeks, you're
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:06.680]   seeing a lot of panicked selling to cover losses and other
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:11.800]   things. So I think that number one that happened. Number two,
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.520]   regulators basically said we're going to go after these guys
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.560]   every single which way we can. And then number three, I think
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.920]   it started to change the innovation cycle where people
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:26.000]   now actually believe that they can't outspend because folks
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.040]   won't tolerate it. And the things that they're spending
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:32.200]   their money on seem kind of foolish. And so I think the you
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.080]   know, big tech is probably not discussed enough, but it was a
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.600]   huge loser for this year, in terms of what happened.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.600]   2022, actual biggest business loser, Chamath says big tech,
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.200]   freeberg, who is your biggest business loser for 2022?
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.440]   I mean, this one's just a simple FTX. I mean, that was such a
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:57.640]   incredible revelation of the scale of the scam and the fraud
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.480]   and the craziness that went on. And I think what was interesting
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.600]   about FTX is it had implications, not just for
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.400]   crypto, and not just for kind of offshore regulatory and not just
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.800]   for fraud, but also for the investors, we had a whole debate
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.800]   about whether the press and journalists failed to kind of,
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.600]   you know, appropriately investigate this guy rather than
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.040]   give him accolades, because he said the right things, which he
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.760]   said he did over I am. And investors fail to do relevant
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.840]   amounts of due diligence or form a board and have proper
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.440]   governance over him, because they wanted to be part of the hot
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.920]   new thing. And everyone had capital to deploy. And I think
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.320]   what was interesting about the FTX failure is it didn't just,
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:37.080]   it wasn't just a failure due to fraud, but it revealed so many
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:42.560]   parts of kind of, you know, I call it, you know, systemic,
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.800]   laziness and systemic kind of blind eye and systemic bias that
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.960]   allowed and enabled this to happen. It was really a
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.720]   revealing kind of failure. And that's why I kind of gave it the
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.280]   the award, Mr. David Sachs, who is your biggest business loser
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.960]   of 2022?
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.840]   Well, you kind of mentioned this, I picked Bob J. Peck is
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.920]   the former Disney CEO, he was Iger's handpicked successor three
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.480]   years ago, then the pandemic hit, which shut down the theme
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.360]   parks. But then I think the big mistake was allowing himself to
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.200]   be mow mowed by woke employees into picking a fight with
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.160]   DeSantis over the so called don't say gay bill. That caused
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.600]   DeSantis to retaliate by threatening the special
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:27.040]   privileges that Disney enjoys in the state. And then he had
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.840]   Iger undermining him behind the scenes. This was revealed, I
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.720]   think, as a Wall Street Journal story, that he was grousing to
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.200]   insiders that JPEG was not soliciting his advice. And he
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.680]   was undermining confidence in with the board. And recently,
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.640]   JPEG was forced out and I was put back in charge.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.360]   Fantastic choice for the biggest loser.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.000]   How brutal does Iger look in that Wall Street Journal piece?
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.680]   I mean, would anybody work for him?
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.960]   Yes, he is incredible. He looks terrible. I agree. I read that
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.160]   piece twice, actually. The CFO calling him up, she was the one
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.240]   who stabbed him, you know, in knife JPEG. It's a great wall.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.880]   So I don't think that I don't think that that happens without
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:08.080]   the support of the person waiting in the wings.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.480]   Hey, listen, there's a couple of jobs, you never quit. You never
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.160]   quit a hit TV show. You never quit a hit band like Roger
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.160]   Water. It is with Pink Floyd.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.240]   Why didn't they just extend his
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:17.720]   retire?
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.520]   Quit the Disney job. It's the best job as a job in the world.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.680]   But Jason, why go through never quit? Why go through the
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.800]   theatrics of like grooming somebody, putting them in your
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.880]   job and then undermining them? Like I all I'm saying is if
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.800]   you're I think he made a mistake. I think he made a
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.400]   mistake. He quit and he wanted to come and also if like if
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.920]   you're a good up and coming exec I mean, what do you do if like
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.400]   all of a sudden like, you know, you have the opportunity to get
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.400]   groomed for that job. It just seems really risky.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:48.640]   Yeah, I mean, I think Bob Iger realized when he in that piece,
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.840]   they say he went on his yacht, his wife didn't come with him.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.960]   The Wall Street Journal piece is incredible. And he's got bored.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.280]   And he's 70 something years old. He's like an early 70s. Why
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.280]   would you give up the greatest job in the world? So he went
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.200]   back and he took it back.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.560]   Didn't Disney have a mandatory retirement age?
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.400]   But this is my point is he was so he was so prolific, he could
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.840]   have extended it. Why not just extend it and be done with it?
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:14.040]   Did you guys read the book he wrote? That lifetime? What is it?
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.360]   Yeah. And I think that what was interesting about that book was
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.800]   the entire thing was built around a series of deals that he
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.920]   did. It was like I did this acquisition, then I did this
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.840]   acquisition, then I did this acquisition. And everything for
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.160]   him was building this, this this empire by doing deals. And
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.720]   someone whose storyline and narrative that they tell of
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.600]   themselves, that's built as a series of deals is a deal
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.800]   junkie. And you're not going to be a deal junkie, where that's
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   your excitement. That's the thrill. That's the adventure
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.400]   that you get out of life. And then you go and sit on a yacht,
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.480]   you're not doing any deal sitting on a yacht. And you're
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.120]   going to want to get back to that. And I think it's less
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.840]   about kind of management and product. And it was much more
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.360]   about being in the midst of doing deals. And that's why he
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:54.840]   came back.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.480]   If this was part of Iger's diabolical strategy to get back,
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.440]   let me just say like, one of the ways he did it, I mean, Chapek
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.840]   had the right instincts, which is when this whole Florida
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.880]   debate happened over don't say gay, highly contentious, no
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.960]   comment. No comment, his instinct was just to stay out
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.680]   of it. But then Iger made some statements about how companies
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.160]   have to live up to their values, not good stuff. And then the
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.920]   employee started, you know, again, you know, a Mau Mau him
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.280]   to get involved. And he took the bait. And he got involved. And
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.200]   what he didn't expect is that DeSantis wasn't going to just
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.520]   roll over to Santa's hit him back really hard. And it cost
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.360]   them economically. And then
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.840]   and in the first interview that Iger gave when asked about this
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.200]   question, he was like, no comment.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.120]   Yeah, he's like, we're not gonna get involved in politics
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.600]   anymore. We're not gonna get involved in politics anymore. It
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.080]   was hilarious. That was
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.480]   an hilarious Chapek to basically get involved in politics. And
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:51.640]   then basically became cannon fodder for DeSantis. Exactly.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.000]   I mean, how diabolical is that?
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.040]   It's so diabolical, so dirty. The other two were cheap. It
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.880]   said, we're going to take away your PNLs to each of the
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.880]   leaders that is like just neutering them that he basically
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.200]   said, everybody's under the CFO, everybody's going to be on one
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.200]   PNL that infuriated all the creatives. And then he went to
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.560]   war with Scarlett Johansson over a $10 million settlement for her
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.600]   black widow. He couldn't handle talent, he couldn't handle the
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.120]   politics. And he wanted to control everybody's PNL just
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.240]   unforced error after unforced error. Congratulations to my guy
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.440]   Bob Iger, I own the stock.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.960]   Do you think it was diabolical at all?
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.800]   Oh, in the best possible way. In the best possible way, which
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.680]   means that Disney stock is going to go up. Yes, I'm buying more
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.560]   Disney stock this year.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.080]   Is all the woke progressive politics that he projects? Is
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:45.640]   that all just a game to mask what a vipers nest their
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.000]   executive suite really is?
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.280]   Are you telling me that Disney is a political corporation after
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:54.400]   Eisner and Bob Iger and all of this? Michael Ovitz? I mean, it's
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.520]   the history of Disney. It's the greatest job in the world. It is
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.240]   Game of Thrones to get that job. And Bob Iger got it back. He's
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.800]   my guy. I'm sticking with them. Okay, they have the best IP in
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.320]   the business. I don't care how he gets that job back. He's
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:06.680]   awesome.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.200]   I gotta say the IP at Warner Media is a real strong
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.560]   contender. I mean, that was a lot as we were talking about
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.280]   this yesterday, how good White Lotus season two was, let's
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:19.640]   open up the discussion. It is incredible how HBO produces
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.800]   extraordinary hit after extraordinary hit the quality
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.920]   and the consistency of that quality coming out of HBO is
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.320]   like nothing else. You'll go I mean, look, Avatar two, I did
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.960]   not like Avatar one, I thought it was junk. Avatar two is
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.840]   getting panned for being junk as well. Not everything that comes
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.920]   out of Disney is a hit. They certainly have the best
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.120]   franchises. But man, Warner Media has a lot to contend with
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.040]   and you know, they could end up being a real challenger to
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:44.960]   Disney in the years ahead.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.920]   Saks Did you watch the White Lotus season two? Yes or no?
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.960]   No problem. It is absolutely fantastic. We have to do a
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.280]   little fan service here. What did you love Chamath about White
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.360]   Lotus season two, give the fans a little service here.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.400]   Wait, it's on season two. I haven't even seen season one. I
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.840]   don't even know what you guys are talking about.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.200]   Okay, it's the hottest show in television.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.720]   Well, I'll tell you what's incredible is there's a
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.920]   diversity of characters and they weave the super like, you know,
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.680]   interesting story together, but each of the characters are so
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:17.520]   distinct. And the characters are played so well. I mean, we were
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.480]   talking about, you know, we were kind of at dinner last night
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.160]   talking about who our favorite character was on the show. And
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.160]   everyone has a different answer. And everyone has a different
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.760]   reason. And then there are characters that you hate. But
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.320]   the fact that you hate them, and the fact that you despise them
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.160]   draws you in, you're drawn into these characters. I think that
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.240]   the the way that they kind of portrayed and the way that the
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.960]   characters were acted by the by the actors, and then the way
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.720]   that they all kind of weave together to tell this
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.600]   extraordinary story. It was really, it was really compelling.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.040]   And it was like, just super impressive. Directing, acting,
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:50.800]   writing everything.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.560]   There are a handful of scenes in season one, and season two,
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:40:00.120]   which I would say are unbelievably psychologically
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:06.560]   violent. And there's just no other way to describe like, how
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:11.400]   they just expose and by the way, they do it with simple shots,
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.360]   very simple dialogue, it's almost nonchalant in the way
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.360]   that they present these truth bombs. And you have to sit there
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.320]   and process it. And you're just like, Oh my god, it's just it's
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.480]   wave after wave. It's an incredible, incredibly well
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.120]   written show.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.840]   The character development is extraordinary. Amazing.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:33.040]   Production and set design, by the way. Also, I mean, when you
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.440]   when you watch it, don't you want to cool?
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:40.440]   Do you guys remember in season ones? Saks will remember this
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.240]   because Saks watched it season one, the family is sitting at
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.840]   the table where they're watching the Hawaiian dance. And Paula,
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.280]   yes, the guest of the family gets up and leave, she can't
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.320]   take it anymore. And then the next day, they're in a
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.320]   discussion about it. And the father says something about, I
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.720]   think, hierarchy or imperialism or something. And it goes around
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.440]   the table, and she just deadpan. She says, Well, maybe it's just
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.440]   time for others to eat. Talking about, you know, like fixing
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:10.520]   these wrongs. And I had to listen to it two or three times.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:14.200]   I'm like, Oh, my God, that is that is a line that just sticks
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.360]   in your brain. There's a few of those in that show that I think
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.200]   Eric said, and I was saying, like, they really draw you in.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.440]   The set design, the production design is so compelling. You
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.200]   want to be there. You want to be in that experience with those
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:27.960]   characters.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:32.760]   Yeah, you're totally the pineapple sweet. I mean, and
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.440]   then in this season, that whole hotel, I looked up the hotel, by
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.600]   the way, online, they hadn't, you know, their their own set
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.960]   design, people come in and redo the hotel, but it is an actual
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.040]   hotel. It's a real, they just made it so magical. Yeah, it was
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:43.920]   such an incredible,
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.800]   Oh, free book, we should make that the host of the wall in
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.040]   summit 2023. Wonderful.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.720]   I'm working on my Jennifer Coolidge.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.400]   Tell your director, David Sacks, what you'd like to do for you.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:01.120]   Yeah, my biggest loser was crypto. And I think there'll be
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.360]   a subsequent domino to fall, which is now that Gary G, and
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:11.280]   the SEC has FT x and the FT t tokens as the grift, he's going
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.120]   to go down the list of other tokens, and he is going to start
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.840]   doing more prosecutions of grifts in crypto biggest loser
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:24.120]   for me. Alright, biggest business surprise. Let's see if
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.120]   we can get sacks back engaged in the conversation now that we're
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:32.640]   not talking about art and life. Sacks. Last year, your biggest
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.240]   business surprise,
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.120]   Saks just produced a movie about Dolly.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:39.160]   I know he is. I'm joking with him. He's a true artist. And he
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.680]   sold it to Mark Cuban. Congratulations on the sale.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:46.600]   David, I guess me and Cuban are besties now. Fantastic. In 2021
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.520]   are selections for business biggest business surprises. I
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:55.040]   was very surprised by dows. Chamath by Moderna. Saks by
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.360]   tech moving to Miami and Friedberg. You were surprised
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.160]   by NF T's. What were we surprised by in 2022? Friedberg
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.760]   will start with you. Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, I think
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.160]   took everyone by surprise. It kind of went I mean, this is
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.680]   such an obvious one, but it went from a whimsical fantasy and
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:15.680]   idea to suddenly, you know, cold hearted reality with, you know,
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.520]   a huge kind of negotiating saga that took place and court
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.200]   battles and all the drama that ensued. And here's what I think
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.520]   was most surprising about it. It wasn't just the acquisition and
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.840]   the and the fact that the acquisition closed, but it was
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:35.400]   the the incredible veracity of the head cutting, cost cutting
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.280]   the demands that people return to work return to the office.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.320]   And then what was most surprising that followed that is
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.040]   the impact that that seems to have had on the rest of Silicon
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:48.040]   Valley, where now nearly every VC I speak with every CEO, every
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.800]   board is looking to Elon's behavior for right or for wrong
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.560]   for you know, moral, moral or not. And saying that's a model
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.400]   for how you can challenge your team to achieve the impossible
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.880]   in an impossibly difficult environment, which is what we
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.720]   find ourselves in. And so I think it was a series of
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.880]   surprising events. He bought Twitter, he made these
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.280]   incredible changes, and then everyone seems to be looking to
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.840]   that as a model. And it's really resonated, it's created a
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.880]   rippling effect. I'm not saying it's good. I'm not saying it's
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.560]   bad. I'm not saying it's moral right or wrong. But the whole
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.360]   thing was really an incredible, surprising, unexpected saga this
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.480]   year. So I give the Elon acquisition of Twitter kind of
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.000]   the award.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.600]   Chamath, do you have a biggest surprise?
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:31.040]   I would say it's Jerome Powell and the Fed and their staunch
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:36.200]   hawkishness on inflation. I think everybody wants all of
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.120]   this to be over. And I think we're definitely in the last few
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.760]   innings of it. But I think what was surprising was how
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:48.640]   consistent and how hawkish and how bearish Jerome Powell was
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:54.120]   every chance he got. He didn't capitulate or waiver from the
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:58.080]   key message, which he was saying from the beginning, which is, we
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.000]   have the tools to fix a broken economy. But we don't have the
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.160]   tools to fix runaway inflation. And so we will raise rates
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:10.400]   higher than anyone expects and keep them there longer than
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.120]   anybody wants, because on the back end of it, we can fix a few
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.800]   broken bones. But if left unchecked, this could really do
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.560]   a lot of damage. And I think that that was an enormous
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:23.320]   surprise that all the political pressure in the world, all of
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.160]   the financial capital markets pressure in the world did
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.960]   nothing to change his position. Saks, what was your biggest
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.480]   business surprise of 2022? David Sachs biggest?
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.240]   Well, it was it was a pretty big surprise that Adobe bought
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:40.000]   Figma for 20 billion. That price tag in this environment, pretty
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.560]   big surprise. But I gotta say, I think Freeberg nailed it. Got to
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:48.120]   say that the business saga of the year was Elon buying Twitter.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.760]   First, liberal media was up in arms that he might do it, then
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:55.640]   they insisted that he must complete the deal. In any event,
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:59.080]   he he did ultimately buy the company. Now he's affecting his
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.400]   changes. I agree. That's the big business story of this year.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.160]   Certainly was a big surprise for me that I got deposition for
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:04.840]   six hours.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.640]   Is it a surprise that you're sitting in Twitter's
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.400]   headquarters today right now?
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.480]   Yeah, it is a surprise. But just by the way, the rumors and
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:14.000]   speculation are getting out of hand. I am not a candidate for
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.040]   CEO of Twitter. So I want to put the kibosh on that because it's
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.000]   starting to get out of hand.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.160]   Jay Cal, the job is yours, my friend. Congratulations. All
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.800]   right, I guess. Let me know when I start. You've worked hard.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:31.840]   You're you're Jay Cal, the last man standing last man standing
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.040]   out with outlaws. Now that sacks has said he is not taking the
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:39.640]   job a bunch of libs have just stopped taking Xanax. The libs
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:43.800]   biggest fear was sax was gonna get that job. We just canceled a
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.200]   bunch of Xanax prescriptions. Congratulations to the libs. sax
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.120]   is not going to be your overlord on Twitter. For me. It's
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:54.280]   obvious. The Twitter acquisition is the biggest surprise by far
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:58.200]   and away. Freeberg I couldn't summarize it better. I will say
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.760]   in six weeks, what we have seen there is nothing short of
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:06.360]   extraordinary. Have there been bumps in the road? Has it been a
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:10.920]   little chaotic at times perhaps, but the features that are coming
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.480]   fast and furious are going to be the story going forward. You've
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:18.360]   seen Twitter for business. sacks had his fingerprints all that
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:22.320]   you may fingerprints all over that. You may have seen hashtags
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.520]   for stock tickers. I was briefly involved in that. There are
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:30.160]   going to be so many features coming. And this is what Elon
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:34.800]   zone of excellence is product. He is an engineer. He's a
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.400]   product genius. The proof is in the pudding, whether it's
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.280]   rocket ships or the cars, we're going to see a parade of
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:44.960]   features, I predict in another six to 18 weeks, we will see
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.760]   people talking about all the great features in Twitter, not
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.560]   any of the transitional issues and people will be shocked my
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:56.920]   runner up metastock collapsing. That was my runner up for the
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.800]   biggest business shock is that they just absolutely collapsed.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.640]   I was just gonna add to what you're saying about new features
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.080]   launching while we've been sitting here on this pod and I've
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.600]   been checking my Twitter feed. There's a new feature where
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:12.240]   there's a view count on all of your tweets and all of everybody
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.960]   else's tweets as well. So you can see how many views a tweet
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:19.680]   is generating. So this tweet that I posted yesterday has 1.5
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.400]   million views. It's like incredible. So it really shows
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.960]   the incredible reach of Twitter. And anybody who's thinking about
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.200]   going to like some knockoff like mass or something is gonna have
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.800]   to contend with the fact that it doesn't have nearly the
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.560]   distribution. So I think this really shows the power of
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.600]   Twitter. And then Dave Rubin, notice my I tweeted this just a
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:46.600]   second ago. And Dave Rubin noted that the New York Times doesn't
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:50.840]   have anywhere near the views for its tweets, because they bought
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.520]   all their followers, which is interesting. I didn't know that.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.440]   But I just went over to the New York Times profile and my tweets
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:01.440]   are routinely getting 10 to 20 times more reach more views than
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:05.680]   theirs. So this is a super interesting indicator of who
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.040]   actually people are paying attention to. On Twitter. It's
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:09.720]   fascinating.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:13.200]   This is fascinating. I'm looking at my own I just did how do you
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:18.040]   give a $30 billion fraud bail, referring to SPF. And that was
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.560]   just less than an hour ago. No, it's 30 minutes. Yeah, an hour
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.680]   ago. And I have 50,000 views already, which is 10% of my
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.480]   follower count. So this is an extraordinary you see right next
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:32.080]   to likes retweets, quote tweets, the feature train is coming. And
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.160]   this will change the dialogue all these haters who are like
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.440]   Twitter is going to go down who are rooting against Elon. Let me
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.600]   tell you something, if a guy can land two rockets at a time, and
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:45.600]   he can literally restart the electric car movement, and he
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.760]   becomes the number one car in any category, he releases a car
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:53.720]   and how on earth would you bet against him to build software,
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.240]   you have to be idiotic.
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:58.340]   This is way too much. I mean, you guys like we should sorry,
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:02.940]   he's a future. Second ad. Yeah, you're selling a product for a
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.860]   company that you guys are working at. Like, I mean, come
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:09.020]   on. I'm not working. Well, you guys are advisors, right? I mean,
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:11.460]   like, Nick, can you let me show another feature? So I think it's
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.380]   cool. Nick, let's go. Yeah, keep on feature. Let's go pull up my
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.260]   profile real quick. Welcome to this week in Twitter. Oh, my
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:20.780]   god. Twitter now has affiliate badges. You can see I've got a
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:25.020]   little craft ventures badge next to my name. So if you you should
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:28.500]   be able to click on it actually, to get to the craft ventures
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:35.520]   profile. Yeah. So you're gonna be able to affiliate users with
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:39.220]   business accounts. And it creates kind of secondary badges
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.940]   after the blue check. I think even the corporate journalists
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.900]   are going to love this because if you're a New York Times
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.980]   writer, you'll have a little NYT badge next to your name, Wall
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.940]   Street Journal, whatever, you'll have the little badge. So more
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:52.260]   and more people are gonna get blue checks. And then people are
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:55.420]   gonna have secondary or even tertiary badges that are
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:59.340]   basically specific to their affiliations. Okay, so I think
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.660]   let's make sure we get let's get an all in badge, we are gonna
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:05.420]   have all in badges really soon. Awesome. Okay, let's go for
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.940]   free work free works. That was our biggest business surprises.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.660]   And we just canceled your account freeberg. It's locked
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.740]   out. We just took away your goes to it. Anyway, it's all good.
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:18.020]   Don't worry about it. Okay, best science breakthrough. Here's an
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:22.740]   easy one for us to do 2022. biggest science breakthrough.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:25.740]   What have you got? Sultan of science we call it of course,
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.620]   have to start with your 22 biggest science breakthrough
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:28.100]   freeberg.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:31.220]   Yeah, I'm gonna give it obviously to the the
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:34.140]   demonstration of net energy gain from the National Ignition
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:38.740]   Facility in plasma fusion that we talked about last week. I
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.780]   wouldn't call it a breakthrough. By the way, I think we we use
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.820]   that as a misnomer last week, but I'm still gonna put it in
[00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:48.420]   this category. It's more of a milestone along a very long path
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:50.500]   a very arduous path of very difficult work that's been
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.620]   taking decades. So it's a great milestone. But I think what was
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.660]   so important and impactful and powerful about it is that it's
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:59.700]   really catalyzed a change a sea change in the investing in the
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.180]   outlook that this is becoming more reality. As I mentioned
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:05.300]   last week, we've seen an increase of nearly 40% in the
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:07.700]   number of fusion startups, and the amount of capital that's
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:10.180]   flowing in is now reaching 10 billion a year. So this is
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:13.020]   becoming you know, a real investable or an area that's
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:15.220]   getting real investment. Some people might not think it's very
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:17.740]   investable. But that's why I think it's been an important
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.620]   year for fusion. And I think, you know, it's something I
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.020]   highlighted last year I was excited about.
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:26.260]   And I to pick fusion. Also, just point of clarity last week,
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.300]   some people Chamath before you go to your prediction, we're
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.300]   saying, hey, you're talking your book on solar when you were in
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:33.860]   your disagreement with Friedberg. That's obvious.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.180]   You've been very upfront that you're investing in solar, you
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:36.940]   placed your bet.
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:38.940]   Yeah, 100%.
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:43.460]   Yeah. So just to everybody knows he made that bet. He's talked
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:44.300]   about it incessantly.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:47.260]   Plus, those idiots that were saying that are stupid. But
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:51.860]   yes, let me let me further clarify what I said last week
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.300]   and why it's important. If Nick, can you bring up the capital
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:57.580]   asset pricing model again, the most important thing for me is
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:03.060]   to make sure that we don't misallocate human capital into
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:06.540]   endeavors that I think are best left for research institutions
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.900]   funded by the government. And I think when you look at a capital
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:14.900]   asset pricing model and try to build one out for fusion, as an
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:19.060]   example, the expected rate of return that you need to get from
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:22.900]   this is just astronomically high, because of the beta of
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:25.820]   that investment risk, and the market risk premium you have to
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:29.660]   generate. And so, you know, from my perspective, I think that
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:32.660]   there are probably four or five labs in the world that are
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:36.420]   capable of actually getting us to a positive energy equation. I
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.620]   think Friedberg, I really thank you for actually saying that it
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:42.020]   wasn't a breakthrough and more of a milestone. I think the real
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:45.780]   breakthrough is when we have positive, not just jewels, but
[00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:49.020]   we actually convert that into electrical energy, right. And we
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.100]   actually talk about power and Watts. And I think that most
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:54.100]   people listening probably don't even understand the difference
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.100]   between jewels and Watts or don't even care. And they want
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:59.780]   to jump around here or there. So the point is that there's an
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:03.660]   enormous path we need to take in physics. And I think it's best
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:06.380]   done in governments. And I don't want to see a bunch of billions
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:10.180]   of dollars get wasted to get to to get marginal cost of energy
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:14.500]   to zero right now. I think there is a point in time where private
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:18.860]   startups can take the last 20 or 30%. But I think about this,
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:22.460]   like the internet, which is you needed DARPA to build v one. And
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:26.140]   then it could be handed over to private industry. And I think
[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:29.780]   fusion when we look back, will look very similar. And all the
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:32.740]   folks that try to build, you know, versions of the internet
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:35.580]   that were private, I think found themselves lagging, because
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:37.940]   there's just a level of investment that's required.
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:40.420]   That's best served in government. So anyways, that's,
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:44.020]   let's clarify that for all the folks who got their panties in a
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:47.060]   bunch of dunes. But in any event, my science breakthrough
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:49.660]   of the year is that there was a 13 year old girl, this was, you
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:52.020]   know, because of all of this fusion stuff, actually, we
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:54.140]   didn't even get to cover it, because it happened in the same
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:58.100]   week. And I think this is infinitely more impressive and
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:02.100]   is an actual breakthrough, which is a 13 year old girl in the
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:08.100]   United Kingdom, who had a heretofore, uncurable form of
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.380]   leukemia, T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. So
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:14.340]   typically, you start in chemotherapy. If chemotherapy
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:18.940]   doesn't work, you move to bone marrow transplants. And it was
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:26.940]   uncurable. And a lab in the UK, basically using CRISPR edited
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:31.180]   these transplant T cells to go in and wipe out her cancer. And
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:36.180]   now her cancer is literally undetectable. Now, if you bring
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:38.740]   up that capital asset pricing model, again, Nick, what I'll
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:42.460]   tell you is, the rate of return on a human life, in my opinion,
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:48.060]   is infinite. And so here is an unbelievable breakthrough that
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:50.700]   got very little attention, because everybody was wrapped
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:53.740]   around the axle of fusion. It happened in the same week. So
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:56.820]   maybe it's understandable, I didn't understand it. But I
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:59.300]   think this is the single most important thing that happened in
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.900]   science, not just this year, but frankly, in the last decade,
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:07.980]   because if you can actually now do base editing, and eradicate,
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:12.380]   at least in this case, a blood based cancer, and eventually
[00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:15.420]   we'll be able to bring that and use that towards solid state
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:20.820]   tumor cancers. It's a huge breakthrough in just human
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:25.340]   longevity and human quality of life. And that happened just a
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.020]   few weeks ago.
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:30.180]   Okay. And of course, for David Sachs, his biggest science
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:35.340]   breakthrough is I don't care. So moving on. Go ahead, tell us.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:39.780]   Yeah, no, this category reminds me of when Biden had that moment
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:43.220]   where he's like, America can be defined in a single word. And
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:46.420]   he's like, that's kind of how I feel about this category.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:51.820]   America is a nation that can be defined in a single word. I was
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:52.420]   gonna put him in.
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:58.980]   Amazing how you figured out a way to be derogatory about Biden
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:02.060]   in the science section, a new low even for you, sex.
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:05.660]   Oh, it's a good one. Thanks. I like it. All right, biggest
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:09.900]   flash in the pan. 2021. This is what we said were the biggest
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:14.380]   flash in the pan. I said the woke socialist leadership of
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:18.700]   cities, ie Chesa, Boudin. Friberg said the Constitution
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:22.780]   Dow. SAC said the word transitory very well played. And
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:25.940]   Shemot said the metaverse also very well played. Everybody
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:30.220]   take that. Yes, very good. Everybody get your flowers.
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:34.020]   Enjoy all of those seem like pretty good selections. But this
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:37.780]   year is what everybody wants to hear about. Friberg. Tell us
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:41.940]   now. Who is your 2022 biggest flash in the pan, the
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:47.100]   undisputable who we got his flash in the pan of 2022 was the
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:53.380]   all in summit. Oh, that hurt. It went. That will always be a
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.900]   strong and significant memory. It was such a hot thing for a
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:02.580]   minute. And then it died. So to the all in summit, I raised my
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:07.660]   glass, I pour one out. I toast to you to Miami. And unless
[00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:10.500]   David Sachs carries it from here. It was a flash in the
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:13.620]   pan. It was a flash in the pan. A sex Who's your flash? Which
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:15.340]   Democrat is a flash in the pan for you?
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:20.020]   This is where I had Liz truss. As you guys mentioned, she only
[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:24.300]   survived 44 days as PM. I mean, that's only for scaramoochies.
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:32.340]   She was basically fired by the bond markets after she combined
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:37.060]   a Thatcher s tax cut with massive energy subsidies to
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:39.500]   counter the price spikes caused by the war in Ukraine that she
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.740]   was financially committed to. This was deemed untenable by the
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:46.020]   UK Central Bank and crashed the pound. And I think there is a
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:49.940]   serious point here, which is that as much as Thatcher and
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:53.420]   Reagan were the two towering heroic figures of the 1980s, I
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:57.100]   think zombie Thatcher ism is not going to be electorally viable
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:00.780]   in the UK, just like zombie Reagan ism is not going to be
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.580]   viable United States. I think that the conservative movement
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:07.220]   has to stop living in the past, we have to develop fresh ideas
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:10.300]   to meet the economic and foreign policy challenges of today.
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:15.100]   Chamath, do you have a flash in the pan? I actually think fusion
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:19.140]   literally was a flash in the pan. It was it lasted 10 to the
[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:22.820]   negative 10 seconds. So that more less of a flash you can't
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:24.220]   have without being a flash in the pan.
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:26.660]   They haven't. Hey, Sax.
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.420]   Oh, look.
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:31.460]   Oh, is it the proprietor?
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:33.460]   The proprietor, the owner
[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:36.020]   for customer support at your service.
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:39.820]   So actually spent the last 15 minutes selling your new
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:42.660]   features. Yeah, on the podcast. Pretty exciting.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:46.300]   Well, the like the views are like incredible. Yeah. I mean,
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:50.460]   and I saw Dave Rubin already made an observation that if you
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:54.220]   look at New York Times, their views are maybe one 10th like my
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:57.900]   views, just me, yes alone, Twitter. And he said that their
[00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.380]   followers are inflated by just basically buying a bunch of
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.180]   follower accounts.
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.900]   Yeah, the views thing is huge. That's why I pushed the views,
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.660]   which is like actually a lot harder feature to implement than
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.380]   you'd think because the sheer number of transactions per
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:17.300]   second, like it's, I think it sort of requires system wide on
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:20.860]   the order of three, 3 million transactions a second to
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:23.820]   actually calculate the view to calculate and display the view
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:28.420]   count. If I put Twitter, Twitter global, so it's like 3 million
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.700]   per second. It's a lot.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:34.380]   For those of you listening, Elon Musk has joined the pod. Elon,
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:38.020]   how's a how's the first six weeks been generally speaking of
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:38.540]   owning Twitter?
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:41.340]   Well, it's been quite a roller coaster, which obviously you've
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:45.420]   witnessed and been on the roller coaster as well.
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:48.540]   Yes, the drama mean I've taken the drama mean it's quite up.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:53.660]   Yeah, I mean, it's exciting. But I think it sort of has its
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:58.100]   highs and lows to say the least. But overall, it seems to be
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:02.700]   going in a good direction. And, you know, we've got the the
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.980]   expenses reasonably under control. So the company's not
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:09.980]   like, on the in the fast lane of bankruptcy anymore. And we're
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:14.820]   releasing features faster than Twitter's history, at the same
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:19.180]   time as having contained the costs and reduce the cost
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:25.980]   structure by a factor of three, maybe maybe four. So you know,
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:29.860]   the verified is obviously that that's, that's, that's huge.
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:37.180]   It's revenue stream as well as a means of identifying of like,
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.740]   knowing that it's a real person and not a barter or trial
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:46.060]   situation. The having the affiliation organization
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.220]   affiliation, which I suspect you talked about that was a idea of
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:54.940]   David's that was great to have organization affiliation. So you
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:59.220]   can know that somebody is an actual professor at Stanford or
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.140]   that this particular handle is actually Disney, not someone
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:08.940]   simply putting I work at Disney in my in their bio. So I think
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:12.180]   that's gonna be really helpful. It just really just having
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:19.540]   detailed and nuanced verification. So of all the
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:22.940]   various things that you say you are, are these things validated
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:24.500]   by other people and organizations?
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.420]   Can you tell us how you do product iteration, Elon,
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:31.060]   because one of the things that I think some people got jolted by
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.860]   over the last couple of weeks is like a bunch of things got taken
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:37.460]   away or changed or rules changed or policies change. And there
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:40.540]   was very quick action. And then people had all this negative
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:44.420]   feedback about the quick action without communication. But your
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:47.380]   extraordinary talent is to iterate product to success. Can
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:51.700]   you just maybe share with people how you do product iteration in
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:54.060]   this context, to help them understand how some of these
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.860]   decisions get made and why moving quickly is so important
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.020]   and just you know, how you're doing this?
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:02.700]   I'm a big believer in like, you want to look at the net output.
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:08.900]   So it's sort of like, you know, what's the batting average? If
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:14.780]   you're like baseball? The point is, is not that you like, you
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:18.100]   know, hit the ball, but it's like, well, how many home runs
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:20.220]   you get? And how like, what's your actual
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.420]   your slugging percentage?
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.380]   Yeah, slugging percentage? Yeah, yeah. It's like, you've got to
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.460]   swing for the fences, you're gonna, you're gonna, you know,
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.020]   strike out a bit more, but we're gonna swing for the fences here
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:34.140]   at Twitter. And we're gonna do it quickly. So I think,
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.740]   generally, like my error rate, and sort of being the chief
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:43.780]   twit will be less over time. But, you know, in the beginning,
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:49.180]   we'll make obviously sort of a lot more mistakes. And, you
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:52.540]   know, because it's, I'm new to the I'm like, hey, I just got
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:56.780]   here, man. So, I mean, if you look at like the actual amount
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:01.180]   of improvement that's happened at Twitter in terms of like,
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:05.500]   sort of like having costs that are not insane, and getting an
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:09.300]   actually shipping product that on balance is good. I think that
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:15.300]   is that. That's great. Like, I think we're actually executing
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:19.340]   well and getting things done. I think we'll have fewer, fewer
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.500]   gaps in the future.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.260]   How did you get to your intuition on what the efficient
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:27.340]   frontier of employees needed to be to make the product better?
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:28.060]   Well,
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:33.940]   yeah.
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:39.100]   Well, I was part of this, we're basically asked the question,
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.940]   who here is critical? And who here is exceptional?
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:49.180]   Yes, I mean, so, I mean, really, the what the criteria is trying
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:53.180]   to apply, and obviously, you're gonna be perfect. If you're
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:57.260]   moving fast, and there's a lot of, you know, people you're
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.780]   talking about here is that anyone who is exceptional at
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:03.180]   what they do, where the role is critical, they have a positive
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:06.820]   effect on others. And they are trusted, meaning they put the
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:10.140]   company's interests before their own should stay pretty
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:13.300]   straightforward. Yeah. And I know, you know, also, and it
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:19.540]   also is up for working, you know, working hard, like that
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:22.660]   would not that would have not this, this, this, that's not was
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.100]   not Twitter's prior culture.
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:28.460]   Yeah. Were you surprised that that the intersection of circle
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:32.180]   and the people that left was basically 25%? Were you
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:34.860]   surprised it was that deep? Or did you think your intuition was
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:36.820]   like, it's probably somewhere in here?
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:40.540]   Well, I think you could just stand back and say, without
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:45.700]   knowing how many employees Twitter has at all, and say, how
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:50.020]   many people are really needed to run Twitter? Like, let's say
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.860]   you don't know what the playhead count number is at all. How many
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:56.020]   people are needed to keep the site operational? Like, let's
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:00.340]   say, excluding product, product evolution, you basically have to
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:07.780]   keep the service going. And you have to have customer sort of a
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:11.780]   support function to take down material that is in violation of
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:17.860]   the law. How many people? What's the minimum number of people?
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.860]   That's in the hundreds, probably.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:22.940]   It's not exactly it's not it's not like a giant number.
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.380]   Yeah. Twitter still has like 2000 people, right?
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:28.420]   Yeah, we still have 2000 people. It's not nothing. And actually,
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:34.180]   if there's, there's actually on the order of like, almost 5000
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:39.980]   contractors. Like, almost, yeah, almost all of the what's called
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:44.060]   trust and safety work, which is like, the support functions for
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.900]   the site are done by contractors.
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:50.140]   You're doing a lot more to take down hate speech than the
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.260]   company previously was doing.
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:55.140]   Yeah, absolutely. The hate speech impressions are down by
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.740]   a third, and we'll get even lower.
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:00.740]   Maybe you could speak a little bit to the what we discovered, I
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:04.700]   think, in those early weeks, which was the incentive. The
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.540]   incentive previously was to create as many accounts as
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:12.300]   possible. And there were a lot of quick fixes to lowering all
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.140]   these, you know, what people might call bot accounts. In some
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:18.740]   cases, it was people opening many millions of accounts. But
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:23.140]   we discovered this very early. How easy was it for you with the
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:26.260]   tech team to maybe lower the bot count and all the fake accounts?
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.220]   Maybe you could speak a little bit to that, because people have
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:31.420]   seemed to think that, gosh, it's a really hard thing to get rid
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:33.020]   of bots. And it turns out it isn't.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:39.180]   We still have a fair number of bots in the system. But the like,
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.420]   I think the incentive structure, the way Twitter set up
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.900]   previously was this relentless focus on what they called
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:49.380]   MDAL, which is monetizable daily active users, although I would
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:54.540]   say the monetizable part is dubious. But at least things
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:57.300]   that appeared to be monetized or could be passed off as
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:01.620]   monetizable daily active users. So this, I created an incentive
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:06.580]   to turn a blind eye to a fake accounts. So if the incentive
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:11.100]   structure is like, you know, maximize the appearance of
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:14.700]   monetizable daily active users, then you're just it's a
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:19.460]   strong incentive to pretend that a bot is real. And that's what
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:27.100]   happened. So we're taking a lot of steps to reduce the bots and
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:37.420]   trolls situation. So many. And I think you're seeing that in the
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:41.260]   usage, like, it's not it's not like relatively rare to have
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:44.500]   your replies filled with crypto scams.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.620]   I'm not seeing any anymore. freeberg, you had a question.
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:48.860]   Yeah, I mean, just on your earlier question, you know,
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:52.620]   Elon, when you first started making changes at Twitter, after
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:56.900]   you bought the business, a lot of people kind of took notice at
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:00.380]   how extraordinarily swift and significant those changes were.
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.860]   Yeah. And there's a lot of technology companies that have
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:08.740]   CEOs and investors and boards. And we all talked to a lot of
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:11.820]   them. And they're all now having a conversation like, look at
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:15.420]   what Elon did a Twitter, how can we do something as aggressive
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:20.340]   as swift as deep? Do you think much about kind of the model
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:23.580]   you're playing for other businesses and other business
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:26.380]   leaders, particularly in Silicon Valley and how you're operating
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.580]   Twitter? Do you ever kind of talk about that? Because I know
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.820]   you you mostly talk about your business and you talk about the
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:33.820]   businesses you're running. But you're having a big influence, I
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:36.380]   think, and how other people kind of act and behave that are other
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.700]   business leaders and run other technology companies.
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:42.500]   I mean, to be frank, I'm not I'm not really, you know, active,
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.340]   I'm thinking about that much, because I'm just thinking about
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:51.580]   like, how do we just, you know, just get Twitter to be a
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:54.900]   financially healthy place and, and and fix the engine of
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:59.340]   engineering so we can have a rapid evolution of new products.
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:05.300]   So and, you know, I mean, I guess I'm in sort of, in some
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:09.180]   ways, an unfortunate position where I don't have to answer it
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:16.780]   is not public. And we don't have a board really. So I mean, so I
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:25.220]   can just go, you know, and I can take actions that are drastic.
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:32.020]   And obviously, if I make a bunch of mistakes, then the Twitter
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:38.060]   won't succeed. And that'll be pretty embarrassing and sad. But
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.940]   as long as like I said, as long as the batting average is is
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:48.260]   good. That that the wins out, you know, significantly outweigh
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:53.580]   the mistakes, then, you know, it'll be a great future. And I
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:55.500]   think I'm very optimistic about where things are.
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:59.380]   I think a lot of people want to talk about your understand,
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:03.020]   Ilan, your position on freedom of speech and your principles.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:06.060]   I'm curious, you've been pretty upfront about it. How do you
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:09.260]   think about it? post acquisition? You know, what
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.140]   speech should be allowed in the platform? Kanye came back, he
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:15.260]   just went insane. His account got revoked. What have you
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.740]   learned, I guess, now that you own it, because you must be
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:21.220]   getting a lot of inbound from people asking you, hey, how are
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:24.020]   decisions going to be made, etc. You've been clear,
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:26.540]   transparency is super important in this. But what are your
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:29.620]   thoughts on free speech and speech on a platform like this?
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.060]   Well, I mean, the general principle, I think, is that we
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.420]   should hear close to the law in any given country. So the law is
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:40.740]   very quite a lot by by country. And so I think we should be
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:47.860]   doing free speech that's that's close, close to the law. And
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:54.020]   that's, that's, that's the general principle. The, I think
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:59.100]   there are other things where it's like, okay, we like, for
[01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:03.220]   example, like, if you're an advertiser, you don't want to
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:05.860]   necessarily you don't you don't want your ad, like, let's say
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:13.900]   it's a family movie, next to some, you know, NSFW content,
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:21.140]   even if that content is text. You know, it's like, they'll be
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:26.180]   like, that's probably that's we don't, you know, so. So that's,
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:30.420]   so that's, you know, part of what you know, like, like, so
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:33.180]   there's, there's more of an allowance for what you might
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:35.460]   call what some I call hate speech on the system, but it's
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.380]   just, it's not going to be promoted. It's not like it's
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:41.620]   we're not going to be recommending hate speech. It's
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:46.900]   just a risk of stating the obvious. And we're not going to
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:54.540]   monetize hate speech. So or negative speech like that's not
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.860]   what advertisers want us to, you know, any any, I think it's
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:01.220]   going to be a rare product that wants to be next to seriously
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:01.860]   negative stuff.
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.260]   I was gonna say you referred to it as hey, freedom of speech,
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.860]   but not reach because this is a very nuanced discussion. Like,
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.380]   should this stuff be able to hit the trends, you know, and that
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:09.940]   kind of stuff?
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:12.460]   Like, it's only possible that some things that will be
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:15.860]   regardless, hey, speech will hit will hit will hit trends. But I
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:19.540]   think it's gonna be relatively unusual, especially as we are
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:22.580]   doing a better job of controlling the bots and trolls
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:26.620]   situation. And, and I do want to emphasize like there's
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.420]   difference between bots and trolls like bots like fully
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:30.940]   automated accounts, but like a troll phone would be where
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:33.700]   you've got like, you know, 100 people in a warehouse somewhere
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:36.780]   each with 100 phones. And so they're actually humans, and
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.420]   they're going to pass a capture test or you know, and they can,
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:42.740]   you know, reply, reply, and they're because they're actually
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:47.660]   good humans, but it's actually 10,000 accounts that are just
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:56.580]   that are obviously not operating as as as real people. So that
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:59.700]   that's, you know, stuff like that can cause things to trend
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:03.260]   negatively. That's why I'm like a big proponent of having just a
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:12.220]   low cost verification capability. And, yeah, so, but
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:16.780]   like, this is definitely a work in progress. So there's, like,
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:19.540]   so there's gonna be, and I did, like, one of the first things I
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:22.580]   said, after the acquisition closed was like, we're gonna
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:25.300]   make a bunch of mistakes, but then we'll try to recover from
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:29.300]   them quickly. And that's, that's what we've done. I think we've
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:34.020]   generally succeeded in recovering from them quickly.
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:37.780]   And it's been going pretty well.
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.460]   Was the Paul Graham and journalists suspensions
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:43.900]   mistakes? Have you talked about this publicly about how that all
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:45.100]   kind of got resolved at the end?
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:47.340]   Oh, yeah, I mean, the program suspension was definitely a
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:49.980]   mistake. And actually called program to apologize personally
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:55.340]   for that. Yeah, great. Yeah. So, you know, on the journalist
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:58.140]   front, the I think the journalists essential suspensions
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:04.540]   were not not a mistake, in that, for some reason, a bunch of
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:09.540]   journalists thought they were better than regular than
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:14.060]   everyone else. And that if they engage in doxing and, you know,
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:17.140]   other and break the rules in various ways, that that they're
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:20.740]   not subject to suspension, even though your average your average
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:24.260]   citizen is, and I think that's just messed up. The same rules
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.660]   should apply to people who call themselves journalists as to,
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:32.460]   you know, anyone else on the system. They shouldn't be sort
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:35.500]   of above the rules. For some reason, they thought they
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.700]   should be that's, that's, that doesn't make sense. I don't
[01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:41.780]   think that's right. Yeah. And the rules being transparent and
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:44.700]   upfront. I think that's what everybody's looking forward to
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:47.900]   maybe some just complete clarity and transparency. And you've
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:51.020]   said from the beginning, when somebody gets suspended, or this
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:54.140]   shadow banning of this sort of would tips into this really
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:57.540]   weird stuff that we discovered during or you discovered where
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.740]   the journalists discovered during the Twitter files, it's
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:02.780]   it's kind of a bummer that people are being sanctioned or
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:06.060]   shadow banned. And they don't know it. If we're going to have
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:08.260]   a system, the rules should be clear to everybody.
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.660]   Yeah, absolutely. So the something I've committed to,
[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:14.900]   and we'll, we'll, I think, probably be able to roll that
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:18.820]   out in January. Just by the way, there is like a bit of a, you
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:20.980]   know, we are not going to be rolling out a ton of new
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:23.220]   features over, you know, Christmas and New Year's and
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:30.180]   stuff. So there's like a, you know, was the next sort of
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:35.460]   feature set will probably roll out mid to late January. And
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:40.180]   hopefully in that will, we can include information about why an
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:46.580]   account is suspended, or has what is called within Tesla
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:56.900]   Twitter visibility filtering, aka shadow banning. So and some
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:00.420]   of these things like, are like this, there's a lot of things
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:04.700]   that just happen accidentally, where there's, you know, the
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:07.740]   rules in the system that are meant to detect whether
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:12.220]   someone's a sort of bot or troll or like, brigading, whether
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:16.020]   like, you know, and then an account is sort of innocently
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:23.500]   caught up in that. So, like, there was some accounts just
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:29.300]   suspended yesterday, because, but temporarily suspended, like
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:33.300]   they got like 12 hour suspensions, because someone in
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:37.980]   customers is someone in trust and safety thought that they had
[01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:49.460]   posted a nude photo of Hunter Biden, something. But they
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:52.380]   hadn't, they hadn't actually done that. I don't know, it was
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:53.940]   just basically a mistake. There were some accounts that were
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:57.980]   there were got a 12 hour suspension yesterday for it in
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:01.780]   error. And they weren't sure why it why it happened. It was just
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:06.300]   essentially a mistake. In the Twitter customer support that
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:06.980]   was corrected.
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:10.260]   Yvonne, let me, let me ask you just a slightly broader
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:14.180]   question. One of the things we just talked about was the regime
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:17.580]   change that's happened where, you know, we all have to act
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:20.420]   differently now that the risk free rate is probably going to
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:24.780]   get to 5%. And I'm just curious, across all your businesses. So
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:28.220]   Twitter, yes, but really, more importantly, Tesla, SpaceX, are
[01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:32.060]   there decisions that you will make differently or not at all,
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:35.300]   or will make that you wouldn't have made otherwise, in this new
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:38.380]   regime? And how often do you think about that kind of stuff?
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:44.220]   Well, I think it's more like, like, it does seem like we're
[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:48.780]   headed into a recession here. In 2023. The magnitude that
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:52.980]   recession is debatable, but I think it's at least a light to
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:59.300]   moderate recession, potentially, it's on the order of 2009. So
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:02.900]   that's, so I think it's, it's, it's wise to kind of like,
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:06.860]   prepare for the worst, hope for the best prepare for the worst.
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:11.140]   Don't get too adventurous, like, like, watch out for margin debt.
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:18.020]   Like, I really advise people to not have margin debt in a
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:25.100]   volatile stock market. And, you know, from a cash standpoint,
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:29.540]   keep keep powder dry. You can get some pretty extreme things
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:34.220]   happening in a down market. Like Brett Johnson, who was a CFO,
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:43.460]   who is a CFO, CFO of SpaceX was at Broadcom in 2000. And he said
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:47.460]   that, and that's a good company making good products. And he
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:50.740]   said that, that from from peak to trough, I think in less than
[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:56.620]   12 months, Broadcom went down 97%. So like, even if you had a
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:20:00.820]   small margin loan there, you got you got crushed. And
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:04.180]   subsequently recovered, and I think, you know, to much higher
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:08.580]   levels, but you know, if there's like mass panic in the stock
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:11.740]   market, then you got to be really be careful about margin
[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:20.180]   debt. So but I mean, this is just as we know, this, the
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:26.020]   economy is cyclic. So you and it's somewhat overdue for a
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:33.780]   recession. And my best guess is that, you know, we have sort of
[01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:38.100]   stormy times for a year to a year and a half, and then things
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:46.180]   start to dawn breaks, roughly in Q2 24. If I were to get it,
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:51.420]   that's like my best guess. recessions don't like booms
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.940]   don't last forever, forever, but neither do recessions.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:57.780]   And it's a 14 year boom. So a six quarter recession seems like
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:00.140]   that may that might actually bounce out the last time it was
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:06.500]   what four or five quarters. So it's not easy. Hey, the Twitter
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:11.500]   files. How much longer are these going to go on? It seems like
[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:16.700]   every week, another drop. And these are pretty controversial.
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:20.860]   How much longer are the Twitter files going to go on? In your
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:25.140]   mind? Yeah. And maybe why is this important to you to make
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:26.820]   sure that people understand the stuff? Yeah,
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:29.100]   I think it's important to like, you know, if we're going to be
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:33.740]   trusted in the future to kind of clear the decks for stuff that's
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:41.060]   happened in the past. So I mean, to be totally frank, almost
[01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:43.620]   every conspiracy theory that people had about Twitter turned
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:51.180]   out to be true. So is there a conspiracy theory about Twitter
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:54.340]   that didn't turn out to be true? So far, they've all turned out
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:58.300]   to be true. And if not, more true than people thought.
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:00.860]   Is there a part of the files that really shocked you more
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:02.660]   than the rest of them? Like of the things that have been
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:03.260]   disclosed?
[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.180]   Of all of these things? Is there something that really sticks out
[01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:08.820]   with you as like, holy shit, I had no idea this was happening.
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:13.780]   Or is the whole thing just a big dumpster fire? They were just
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:18.940]   looking at one huge thing. Um, you know, like psyops versus the
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:22.980]   Hunter Biden thing versus the Yeah, the number of FBI people
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:27.220]   involved. That was pretty intense. Yeah, the FBI psyop
[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:29.900]   stuff, to me was probably the one that was the most insidious.
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:32.620]   Like, the rest of it, I could think of, like, you know, a
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:36.140]   bunch of overzealous libs got used. Yeah, got it. You know
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:39.940]   what I mean? Sure, sure. But to have like a secure skiff that
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:43.740]   essentially sends things that, you know, government agents want
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:48.180]   the populace to basically think seems like kind of like a really
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:52.460]   bad dystopian novel. And then it turns out it existed. And then
[01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:54.780]   it also the thing is, it couldn't have just existed at
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:58.540]   Twitter. So what do we do about all the other places where this
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.220]   shit's happened? YouTube, Facebook?
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:03.820]   It did. None of it seemed that surprising to me. I mean, I
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:05.900]   don't know, maybe I just believed all the conspiracy
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:08.620]   theories, but I've also been inside some of these companies
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:11.500]   and seen how they operate. So honestly, none of it was a
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:14.260]   surprise to me. Was it a big shock to you? You want?
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:18.380]   Well, you, you, Faber, you were I think you can claim that you
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:20.660]   weren't surprised that these companies were shadowbanning,
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:24.780]   although they denied it. But did you really suspect that the FBI
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:29.060]   was playing a role in flagging content for these companies to
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:31.060]   take down? Like that blew me away?
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:34.100]   Like content that's got nothing to do with like, terrorism?
[01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:36.460]   Yeah, they're not investigating crimes. There's no crime.
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:43.420]   Right? Yeah, they literally flagged satire. Maybe they
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:44.900]   didn't get the joke. I don't know.
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:50.220]   They don't seem to be a humor driven group. But they don't
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:52.700]   seem to have the best senses of humor. But aren't they supposed
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:55.940]   to get warrants? Isn't that how it's supposed to work in a
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:57.660]   democracy? They want information.
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:02.220]   They're all sitting that's troubling to me. Put yourself on
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:03.420]   either side of the extremes.
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:07.020]   We have Michael Schellenberger here who broke the FBI story in
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:11.180]   the Twitter file. So let's look at him and to see. I can, because
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:14.220]   I think maybe the audience isn't caught up on like what was
[01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:15.260]   discovered. So
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:18.700]   you're not gonna follow Elon Musk. That doesn't seem fair.
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:19.620]   Hey, guys.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:27.460]   Hey, guys.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:31.100]   Hey, Michael, how are you? Okay. Just a quick question for
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.460]   Michael. First of all, first of all, who makes that sweater?
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:37.780]   I'll send you mine, man. Do you want it? Are you making fun of
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:37.940]   it?
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:42.020]   Raise from you, brother. I pray.
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:42.500]   Ask him.
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:48.420]   Just briefly, Michael. Isn't the FBI supposed to get warrants to
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:51.340]   Yes, take actions with folks. And then I guess is that at the
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:53.700]   crux of this? Are they doing this at other companies? You
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:56.300]   think? Are they just like embedded in YouTube? Yeah, we
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.660]   expect they're embedded at meta, and that they don't get
[01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:01.820]   warrants. And they're kind of tipping the scales. And is that
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:03.740]   a good thing for society or a bad thing for society? It's a
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:04.740]   bit of a basic question.
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:08.180]   Yeah. Well, I think there's a there's multiple issues relating
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:11.340]   to FBI that I think have to be unpacked a bit. But the first
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:14.940]   one is that yeah, FBI was constantly pushing the
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:18.580]   boundaries of what is legally and ethically acceptable in
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:22.100]   terms of requesting information. Now, I think what you saw over
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:26.660]   the last three weeks was a shift. And I think our own
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:29.300]   understanding that we did see more pushback from Twitter
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:33.980]   executives against FBI, and some alarm bells being rung in terms
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:35.980]   of the requests that were being made from the intelligence
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:39.860]   community. But these guys were really persistent, they kept
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.580]   asking for more, they kept getting more and more
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:44.500]   cooperation. It's very troubling. It does look like
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.220]   Congress is going to look into this, the two heads of the
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:50.300]   committees that are tasked with this or have said that they're
[01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:52.700]   going to look into it next year. I think the other thing
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:55.940]   that we saw that I think is is more troubling was this
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:26:00.580]   persistent effort to basically communicate to Twitter
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:03.900]   executives, but also to news media, national security
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:07.500]   correspondence, that there was this heavy foreign infiltration
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:11.420]   going on this, this Russian disinformation. And it appeared
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:13.900]   to me looking at all the evidence both that we saw from
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:16.460]   within Twitter and from outside of it that this was pretty
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:21.260]   organized effort to convince key executives at Twitter and
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:25.180]   Facebook, but also these key reporters, that they should
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:29.740]   expect a hack and leak operation sometime right before the
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:33.620]   elections having to do with Hunter Biden. I find that very
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:34.380]   suspicious.
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:37.860]   Can I make an observation? I think that maybe what we're
[01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:41.860]   finding out is that the mainstream media tried to go
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:46.580]   back to its 1980 Cold War playbook and turn Russian to a
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:50.140]   boogeyman. But as we're seeing in the Ukraine war, you know,
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:52.740]   they're not nearly the formidable foe that we thought
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:55.940]   they were. And so it could probably be the case that in
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:27:00.340]   2016, they were as inept technically as as they are
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:03.700]   militarily right now. And so we may have just built up this
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:10.380]   monster that is kind of more like, you know, a much smaller
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:13.140]   thing to be worried about. And we all ran with it because we
[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:15.740]   had no evidence, but the Ukraine, Russia war is evidence
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:18.620]   that you know, this highly sophisticated war machine and
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:21.780]   propaganda machine is not that good at their job.
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:26.220]   Right? Yeah, I mean, I think that what's there's a lot of
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:29.460]   interest that we're being served by hyping the so called
[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:32.260]   Russian misinformation threat. I mean, one of them was just to
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:36.460]   simply explain away the Trump phenomenon, as a consequence of
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:39.300]   foreign interference. Certainly, the people that ran
[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:41.940]   Hillary Clinton's campaign had an interest in doing that. But
[01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:45.940]   then you saw it become a sort of way, I think, to condition
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:51.900]   people for the release of the Biden laptop. And again, we
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:56.620]   can't I can't prove that. But it is striking that the Yole Roth,
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:59.580]   this means Twitter executive, who I think was the object of
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:03.460]   this misinformation campaign, testified under oath that he was
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.540]   being bombarded with these messages all throughout 2020,
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:08.460]   that they should expect some sort of a hack and leak
[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:12.300]   operation. So when the New York Post finally did report on that
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:17.460]   computer, in 2014, it was briefly censored by Twitter, but
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:20.780]   I think more importantly, it was discredited in the minds of many
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:24.380]   voters, including myself, I really didn't think that that
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:27.460]   laptop was what they said it was. And it turned out that it
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:31.100]   was. So I do think it's there's a real troubling pattern of
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:36.060]   behavior by both the FBI agents, but also by the former FBI
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.420]   executives, including the Deputy Chief of Staff and the Chief
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:41.740]   Counsel from FBI that that were at Twitter as executives at the
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:42.140]   time.
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:45.580]   And in fairness, Michael, this has been brought up many times.
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:48.500]   But I just would like your take on it, because you're a lifelong
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:49.260]   Democrat, correct?
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:50.780]   Until until last year.
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:54.180]   Great. So it would, you know, just less anybody think that you
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:55.700]   are like some MAGA supporter here.
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:57.100]   Just look at my sweater.
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:29:02.060]   This was all on the backdrop of Trump asking for the Russians,
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:05.140]   you know, during that debate to hack Hillary for him interfering
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:08.300]   with Zelensky and trying to get him to give dirt on Biden
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:11.780]   and the fact that Hunter Biden was obviously dirty. So to
[01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:17.140]   expect a hack, there was massive precedent for it. So that set
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.300]   the stage for this, correct?
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:23.340]   For sure. And there's definitely that going on. And maybe that's
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:27.620]   all there was to it. It is just striking, of course, because I
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:29.780]   didn't even mention in my this was, by the way, this is
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:33.740]   Twitter thread, part seven that I did on this issue. I didn't
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:36.780]   even get into the fact that, you know, within a few days, the
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:40.860]   many of former senior heads of intelligence organizations and
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:44.220]   others came out and said that it was the result of a Russian
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:47.860]   disinformation campaign. So yeah, sure. I mean, I guess we
[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:51.620]   could find some other explanation for it, whether it
[01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:55.700]   was innocent or coordinated, but it is it is striking. Also, I
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:59.300]   think the other thing that we found was the contrast between
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:02.980]   the the threat inflation and what what Twitter was finding
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:05.940]   themselves. I mean, there was, you know, you'll repeatedly
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:09.500]   you'll Roth would respond to FBI that, yeah, we looked into
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.380]   these accounts that you mentioned, and they were all
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:14.860]   very low follower accounts with very little activity. So they
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:18.900]   just weren't finding very much foreign influence on the Twitter
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:23.380]   platform. And so I just think it was grossly inflated, either
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:28.180]   for kind of good reasons or bad reasons. I would say, yeah.
[01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:31.820]   Yeah. And it's, there's no perfect way to police this
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:34.700]   stuff, obviously. And okay, well, listen, we appreciate
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:38.780]   your reporting. Yeah, for doing it. And if you haven't read
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:44.260]   Michael's book, San Francisco, you did some great reporting
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:48.060]   there as well. And continued success in your investigative
[01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:50.900]   journalism. Thank you, Michael. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:55.100]   All right, cool. Sorry. Awesome. Sorry.
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:56.620]   He's still here.
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:31:01.300]   Hey, you did an interview on that. I think I saw it on
[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:03.220]   YouTube or something where you interviewed someone who was
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:06.340]   homeless in San Francisco, and they were addicted to drugs. And
[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:10.500]   they kind of said some narrative about how they were in this
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:13.260]   condition, because San Francisco basically pays them to be
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.980]   homeless and pays them to do drugs on the street. Did that
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:18.380]   ever get published? And did that come out? Because it was such a
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:21.260]   compelling couple of minutes that you got on tape there. It
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:25.740]   really, for me sent home a message of how far kind of
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:30.700]   progressive policies can take a society. And it's such a beacon
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:32.980]   for where things might go as other people start to think
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:35.780]   about adopting similar policies around the world, which is why I
[01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:38.780]   thought it was such important reporting, whatever happened
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:40.900]   with that. And where can folks see that? Because it was such a
[01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:42.420]   moving interview for me.
[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:45.860]   Yeah, if you just Google Michael Schellenberger YouTube homeless,
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:48.100]   you'll be able to find all my videos. There's a lot of them
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:50.740]   that we did with people on the street. All of them, of course,
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:54.500]   people asking and wanting to do them. But yeah, I mean, what we
[01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:57.060]   I also wrote about that in my book, which is basically a San
[01:31:57.060 --> 01:32:00.180]   Francisco pays cash welfare payment of somewhere between
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:04.940]   six to $700. Plus, you can get $200 in food stamps. And a lot
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:08.660]   of people sadly use that to maintain their addiction. And
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:13.580]   this gentleman, James with the tattoos on his face was very
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:16.900]   honest about how he was playing the system. In fact, he was
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:20.780]   himself, we found this increasingly kind of horrified
[01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:23.340]   by the incentives that San Francisco was creating for
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:26.380]   people to live on the streets and, and live on the streets in
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:28.620]   their in their addiction. So yeah, you can find that on
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:31.820]   YouTube. So many people say incentives drive behavior. And
[01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:35.340]   unfortunately, these policies all came from a good place from
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:38.820]   a kind heart. And the idea that we could help people in need.
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:41.420]   And unfortunately, the way that the incentives get structured,
[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:43.860]   they can actually cause more harm than good. It's such an
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:46.260]   important lesson. I just wanted to say that because I think
[01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:49.660]   you're reporting on this really hit that home. So so thanks for
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:51.540]   doing that. I think it's really important because we have we
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:53.940]   have to do the right thing for people. But we also have to be
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:56.340]   careful that the policies are done in the right way. So I
[01:32:56.340 --> 01:33:00.180]   think it's so well said Friedberg because when you're
[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:03.580]   Michael, and I just think you're very courageous for doing it,
[01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:05.940]   because it's very easy for somebody to say, Oh, well, you
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:09.660]   are being callous. The truth is incentives matter. And we saw
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:11.740]   we've seen this over and over again, if you pay for something,
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:14.580]   you get more of it. And really, San Francisco is bearing the
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:17.740]   burden. I think this is what your book and you know, in a lot
[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:20.380]   of the videos you've made, at least the message I got was, San
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:22.620]   Francisco has the lowest price of drugs, the lowest
[01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:25.260]   enforcement, and the most incentives, therefore, they
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:29.780]   suffer, because every person who is, you know, addicted comes
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:33.420]   here, because they speak to each other. And 90% of the people who
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:36.060]   are in San Francisco are here because we have created an
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:38.780]   incentive structure. Is that directionally correct as we wrap
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:41.820]   here? Yeah, 100% correct, including just the non
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:45.420]   enforcement of laws against sleeping on the sidewalk doing
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:49.100]   drugs in public, not requiring ultimately three times more
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:52.940]   people die, living outside as an unsheltered homeless person
[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:55.780]   rather than live than being in a shelter. And for me, that's all
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:58.660]   you need to know to know that you cannot allow our brothers
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:01.620]   and sisters to sleep on the street, no matter how desperate
[01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:04.460]   they sound about wanting to avoid going inside, it's three
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:07.060]   times deadlier to be on the street than inside. So the
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:10.500]   compassionate thing is to force people into housing. Yes. And
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:13.700]   that's what's right. People to say, but you know, because you're
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:16.420]   we have this perception that people have freedom, and they
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:18.340]   should have the right to do this. But a person who's taking
[01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:22.100]   fentanyl in your research is not thinking correctly. And if it was
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:24.820]   any family member of ours, we would not want them to make that
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:27.060]   decision for themselves. We'd want somebody else to make that
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:28.180]   decision for them, correct?
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:32.180]   Abs, I would want that from if I was on the street, so desperate
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:34.620]   that I was, you know, smoking fentanyl and breaking multiple
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:37.780]   laws every day. Of course, I would want to be hospitalized.
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:41.100]   You know, and usually, you know, people overcome their addiction.
[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:43.620]   That's the good news. We always leave out of it, but it is
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:45.900]   possible people do overcome their addiction all the time.
[01:34:45.900 --> 01:34:49.940]   But they often need some some an intervention from family and
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:51.740]   friends. And if that's too late for that, then you need the
[01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:53.500]   intervention from the from the city.
[01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:57.260]   All right, Michael, thank you, Michael. Appreciate it. So as we
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:01.580]   get back to the all in news network, we've now gone 24 hours
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:05.020]   a day, the all in news network has launched. We'll just have a
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:07.940]   road we should sit at various offices throughout Silicon
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:11.060]   Valley, letting executives and CEOs
[01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:16.740]   imagine we did like a 12 hour marathon show for charity, where
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:19.820]   just people showed up. And we did a what do they call those on
[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:25.700]   TV? What is the charity? Calipane? Yeah, no, no, just a
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:29.220]   t. Yeah, tell about J. Cal has to still fly commercial. We'll do
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:31.700]   a telethon. Hey, sacks. Thank you for setting up those
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:35.180]   amazing drop ins. Well done. Thanks, sacks. Thanks, sacks.
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:37.140]   I think that was good. Your jacket. That's a great jacket.
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:39.780]   Is that custom that isn't he? Sorry, I'll Stuart. He says,
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:43.660]   this is the Christmas or holiday jacket. Who is it by he say?
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:47.700]   It's Valentino. All right. Well, that's that's that's nice. Also.
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:52.100]   Okay, that's nice. Okay, let's keep going here. We got to go to
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:54.180]   lightning round. All right, let's move biggest flash in the
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:58.540]   pan. We were was our last. I went with crypto. Pretty easy to
[01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:01.180]   say that. I'm not going to give myself a big high five. But what
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:03.580]   do you guys think of the Elon conversation real quick? Well,
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:05.860]   he's very talkative. And he's anything interesting or
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:08.380]   surprising for you. I mean, he said the biggest, you know,
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:11.060]   thing that people want to make sure to avoid is margin debt.
[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:14.980]   That was I mean, he's working hard. And he's just such a
[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:17.900]   product of focused guy. He just gets his he's like, so deep
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:21.500]   deeply into it. It's like, yeah, just do the things right,
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:24.100]   Friedberg. I mean, if anything's Oh, my God, of course,
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:27.540]   everything. That's it. That's it. Yeah. So I mean, and you
[01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:31.300]   know, products are made by teams. So what I think is
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:33.180]   distinctly different here, I'm just giving my personal opinion.
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:36.780]   I don't know what Microsoft Teams. No, no, no. Teams make
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:38.980]   products. And so what I just want to say here is, you know,
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:42.380]   like, Microsoft Teams suck. No, that I'm not, you know, don't
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.700]   trigger the bundle. But I just want to say, you know, like,
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:48.700]   this is a takeover. As opposed to building a company from
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:52.260]   scratch, he's had to assemble a team, and then work at this
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:55.460]   incredible product pace. And I think those two things are
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:58.780]   starting to click week. Yeah, six is gonna look very different
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:01.460]   than week the first six weeks. So yeah, the products are really
[01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:03.660]   looking awesome. And it was nice to him to give me that shout
[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:06.700]   out on the you know, the affiliate badges, but I'll just
[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:09.540]   give a shout out. I didn't hear it. What was it? Oh, well, he
[01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:13.140]   gave me he gave me some credit for the affiliate badges. But I
[01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:16.220]   wanted to give credit to the PMs who approached me about that
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:20.860]   idea. I went again. Okay, fine. Whatever is there? Let me give
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:24.420]   me give credit to the actual PMs, Evan Jones and Patrick
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:28.140]   Trauger, who they approached me about this idea they had. And
[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:32.220]   then I helped, you know, give it some momentum. Here's the truth.
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:34.580]   When Dave and I spent the first couple weeks there. Now that
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:37.100]   it's a little more public, he wants to be on the program. What
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:39.780]   we found over and over again, was that there were great
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:42.900]   features that were ready to be released, that were being held
[01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:45.820]   back by management. And there were brilliant people with all
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:48.660]   the ideas that you think should have been released. And they
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:51.940]   just weren't allowed to release a lot of these products. Why?
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:55.420]   Who knows. But now that he's in charge, I think you'll see the
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:57.260]   product cycle is going to go much quicker.
[01:37:57.260 --> 01:37:59.460]   The most important thing I saw, which is such an important
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:02.180]   lesson for anyone running a business in Silicon Valley is
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:05.540]   that the pace of decision making matters far more than the
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:08.100]   accuracy of decision making. It's always been like one of my
[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:09.100]   three big mottos.
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:11.100]   Say more about that for entrepreneurs.
[01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:13.980]   Unpack for me, like my number one, like my three things are
[01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:16.620]   always like grit, biased action, and then narrative, but like
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:21.020]   biased action, the rate at which you can make decisions is a far
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:23.740]   greater predictor of success than the accuracy of the
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:26.340]   decisions you do make. And so you have to be willing to
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:29.060]   embrace failure, you have to be willing to make decisions that
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:31.380]   could result in something not being done correctly, or making
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:34.140]   a mistake, and even getting embarrassed on the internet, you
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:36.060]   know, by making mistakes and having to call people like Paul
[01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:39.580]   Graham and apologize for them. And that was a big moment. But
[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:44.460]   that was interesting. As a business scales, as professional
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:47.140]   managers are brought in, their incentive is to not make
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:50.540]   mistakes, their incentive is to do things that are predictably
[01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:53.060]   going to work, and are predictably not going to fail.
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.700]   And therefore they avoid taking the risks and they reduce the
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:58.340]   rate of action, the rate of decision making. And that's why
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:01.300]   so many businesses ultimately don't scale past some sort of
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:03.540]   inflection point, or when founders that are willing to
[01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:06.380]   push that envelope step out, everything starts to fall apart.
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:08.580]   And it's so critically important, I think, to look at
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:11.060]   that as being I think, Elon's defining trait and
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:13.500]   characteristics that this regardless of the scale of the
[01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:16.140]   organization and the enterprise, he's still willing to act with
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:18.700]   that level of bias to action that you typically see in a
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:23.100]   small startup. Okay. And put his reputation on the at risk. Yeah.
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:23.700]   Just
[01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:30.500]   I sat in a meeting yesterday, he said that if we're not rolling
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:33.940]   back 10% of the time, we haven't pushed hard enough. Right?
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:37.220]   Wonderful. There you go. I mean, it's like, if you're never
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:39.700]   rolling anything back, because you never make a mistake, maybe
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:41.780]   you're just not right. Moving fast enough. You don't have
[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:44.380]   enough, not enough, you're not fast enough, enough of a bias
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:46.700]   towards action, you're too afraid of making a mistake.
[01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:49.260]   By the way, here's what's so interesting about the views
[01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:52.780]   feature is that a bunch of websites, I think it started
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:56.020]   because Instagram did a bunch of apps, deprecated, you know,
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:40:01.180]   likes, because they felt that it was too. It was part of this
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:06.180]   negative cycle. And so they took all this stuff away. And
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:10.780]   basically views is going sort of back in that direction and
[01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:14.460]   giving more granularity in terms of outside in social engagement
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:17.260]   on a post, which is I think, interesting to see it's
[01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:20.500]   happening in a moment where all these other sites, and apps are
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.140]   actually going in the opposite direction.
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:25.860]   Well, it's like a standard feature on YouTube. And it's
[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:27.900]   very powerful for YouTube's network effects, because it
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:31.220]   shows you how many views you get. So it discourages people
[01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:34.620]   from using other sites, because you know, you get the most
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:38.300]   distribution on YouTube. So it's weird that other social
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.980]   networks don't want to follow suit. I mean, in one hour,
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:43.100]   they had it, but they deprecated. That's what's so
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:43.540]   interesting.
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:46.540]   But I guess, you know, my point is, we've only had this feature
[01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:49.220]   for an hour. And I didn't realize how much distribution my
[01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:51.940]   tweets were getting. And it definitely undermines my
[01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:55.460]   incentive to want to go use some other platform when I see the
[01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:56.700]   distribution I'm getting on Twitter.
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:58.820]   Well, if you're getting 10 times more distribution in the New
[01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:00.660]   York Times, you know, what's going to happen is people stop
[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:01.460]   listening and reading.
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:04.460]   Well, I mean, it's sort of like this podcast itself. Like, I
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:06.460]   mean, we people ask us to go
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:11.300]   and my point is, we have to rely on social proof, and anecdotes
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:14.740]   about the actual scale and the breadth and the reach because
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:18.620]   it's impossible for us to get one holistic view that shows
[01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:21.140]   across all of these different modalities, whether it's
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:25.500]   Spotify, or Apple podcasts, or YouTube, how many people listen
[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:28.780]   or watch and you know, we add it all up. And you know, we think
[01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:32.100]   it's in this, you know, sort of three to 5 million range of
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:36.580]   people. But if you just had a numerical canonical number that
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:39.140]   was irrefutable, you just run over everybody.
[01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:42.660]   This turns it into a meritocracy is gonna be terrifying to some
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:46.180]   blue check marks when they see that the people who they report
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:49.580]   on get 10 times as many views as they do, of course, is why when
[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:50.220]   when people
[01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:53.340]   journalists, rather, look at Sean Hannity, go to Sean Hannity
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:55.820]   his profile and for the number of followers he has, how
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:58.420]   pathetically engaged his audience is it's all bots. It's
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:41:59.900]   all trolls. It's all nobody's
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:02.540]   I looked at Mitt Romney just put out a video, whatever. In the
[01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:05.700]   first like half hour, he had 100,000 views, like, every
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:07.620]   politician who starts seeing this is gonna go wait a second.
[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:10.060]   I mean, the world is getting more views here than I am on
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:11.860]   MSNBC or Fox, the world is
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:14.860]   I need to do this rational place if Mitt Romney actually has more
[01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:16.740]   influence than Sean Hannity.
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:19.620]   Let's hope Okay, let's move on. We got to get through this
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:23.940]   quickly. It's our longest episode ever. Here we go. We are
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:28.140]   going to do next up. It's very this is a very important
[01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:34.020]   category. Best CEO of 2022. In 2021. I went with Frank
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:39.500]   Slutman and Elon Musk. Chamath went with Satya Nadella. Saks
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.660]   went with Brian Armstrong and Freeberg went with Jack Dorsey.
[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:49.020]   Now we go on to 2022. Saks who everybody wants to know Saks is
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:51.780]   best CEO of 2022. Go ahead, Saks.
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:56.460]   Every founder took my advice to get leaner. So down there burn,
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:43:00.460]   create runway, you know, weather the storm down, you know,
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:03.740]   generic answer, not a person. Yeah, exactly. I mean, look, I
[01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:07.020]   think actually a lot of the names names. Well, here's the
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:08.140]   problem is that, you know,
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:12.980]   can I finish J. Co. The names that you mentioned from last
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:15.300]   year will be the top candidates for this year. I mean, I think
[01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:18.100]   Satya Nadella had a good year. Obviously, what Elon's doing, we
[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:21.420]   just talked about it's amazing. Brian Armstrong, I think the
[01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:23.820]   stock has done great, but he's been a strong CEO, but I don't
[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:27.380]   want to repeat the same names. I think that, you know, every CEO
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:30.540]   who responded to the regime change by cutting costs,
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:34.700]   getting leaner, extending runway, I think deserves to be
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:37.620]   on this list. And unfortunately, a lot of them are just resisting
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:41.020]   and they're just not yet taking the medicine, or they've been
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:44.180]   taking the medicine in little drips and drabs instead of just
[01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:45.860]   like swallowing it whole and getting a move on.
[01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:50.100]   Yeah, just drink the whole two tablespoons of medicine. Don't
[01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:51.620]   sip it, you got to just take it.
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:54.220]   It's not getting better. I mean, the stock market today should be
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:58.460]   a wake up call. I mean, this is one of the worst days in the
[01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:01.860]   market the whole year. So things are getting worse before they're
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:02.500]   getting better.
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:05.060]   Chamath, who is your best CEO of the year?
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:08.660]   Well, the numerical answer is Vicky Holub, who's the CEO of
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:11.860]   Occidental Petroleum stocks up like 140%. This year, it's
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:16.940]   technically the best performing stock of the year. $63 billion
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:22.180]   portfolio company. But that's just a numerical answer who I I
[01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:24.980]   actually want to double down on David's answer, sexist answer,
[01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:29.740]   because I agree with that. I have been guiding our portfolio
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:35.740]   company CEOs to be at cash flow break even now or extend runway
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:42.820]   to q1 2025. And they're 25. Yes, because I mean, I think, well,
[01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:44.900]   Elon and I are kind of roughly in the same place we have been
[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:47.700]   for a while, which is like, you know, mid 24 is when the
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:50.180]   recession ends, and you need to give yourself two to three
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:52.780]   quarters of buffer so that you can go and raise around which
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:56.260]   takes a quarter to two quarters. And once you start to get kind
[01:44:56.260 --> 01:44:59.940]   of get escape velocity out of a recession, having money through
[01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:06.940]   end of q1 2025, I think is a is a minimum requirement. And, you
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:10.380]   know, of the companies that I think were the most precariously
[01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:15.500]   in the recession, there was five of them that got their acts
[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:19.820]   together and really did it. But these are all CEOs of companies
[01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:21.980]   that you know, I mean, if you said them, you would know some
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:25.260]   of them. But I do agree with David, I think the CEO that bit
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:27.940]   the bullet, so maybe publicly, what I would say is, you know,
[01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:34.420]   the CEO of Karna deserves a huge, you know, medal for having
[01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:36.620]   the courage to do it before anybody else did the CEO of
[01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:40.140]   checkout.com just took a huge write down. These CEOs are
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:44.380]   the ones that helped companies survive. Friedberg, best CEO
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:50.300]   2022. My vote for best CEO is Warren Buffett. And I think it
[01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:55.700]   is just simple arithmetic. He has for years and now for
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:46:00.180]   decades proven himself to be just not just an exceptional
[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:04.260]   investor, stock picker, whatever the kind of typical quip is
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:07.340]   about what he does for a living. But I think what's so
[01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:10.380]   special about Warren Buffett is that regardless of the market
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:14.940]   conditions, he can kind of remain steadfast in his intent
[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:18.660]   and in his mission. And he doesn't kind of waver. And, you
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:21.940]   know, he doesn't take an active role in ranting and complaining
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:25.220]   about markets and politics. And I think that that's what makes
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:27.700]   him such an extraordinary leader, he stays within his zone
[01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:29.620]   of competence, he doesn't do things that he doesn't know
[01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:33.700]   about. He doesn't let the macro drive him and cause him to be
[01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:36.660]   you know, affected by it. And he says, this is what I know how to
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:39.980]   do, this is what I can do. And that is all that he does do. And
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:42.700]   he does it so exceptionally well. And to Chamath's point, he
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:45.300]   is the largest shareholder of Occidental Petroleum, along
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:48.300]   with many other incredible businesses. And I think he's
[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:51.940]   proven in a market like we just had this year, why he is kind of
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:54.780]   the most extraordinary CEO, or one of the most extraordinary
[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:58.780]   CEOs, but one of the best kind of capital allocators of all
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:03.340]   time, I'm going to go in a similar fashion, as Chamath and
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:08.140]   Sachs and go with the money losing CEOs who have dedicated
[01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:12.020]   themselves to free cash flow, and to getting to profitability
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:15.900]   from the last cycle, Airbnb, and Uber were the money losers. And
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:19.260]   now Airbnb is my number one, they become a money printer,
[01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:24.580]   they are now making bank. And they're still growing very
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:28.340]   quickly. And then Uber, I put in my second, they need to do
[01:47:28.340 --> 01:47:31.340]   another riff, they need to cut some expenses, but they too are
[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:34.420]   hitting the free cash flow and the network effects. So I'm
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:38.820]   giving it to Chesky and then Dara one and two. Okay, let's
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:43.060]   keep moving best investor. For me, I'm going with the
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:47.020]   investors, like a general category, who are demanding
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:51.340]   governance and doing diligence again, or who never stopped. Let
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:55.140]   me say it that way. There's a generation of investors who
[01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:57.380]   raised their funds in the last five years and didn't do
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:48:00.500]   diligence, didn't demand board seats, didn't demand boards.
[01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:05.220]   Those idiots are now paying the price. And they created a lot of
[01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:08.500]   this mess of entitlement and a lack of governance. I want to
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:11.700]   give a shout out to the Bill Gurley's of the world, who
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:14.940]   fought for governance and fought for diligence in the face of
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:18.420]   being told, okay, boomer, you don't get it. Who do you have
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:21.300]   best investors? Chamath Palihapitiya.
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:25.780]   I will pick the what are called the pod shops. So these are
[01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:29.020]   folks that have strategies where they have hundreds of investing
[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:32.700]   pods underneath an umbrella. And they have this very
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:35.660]   sophisticated risk infrastructure. So this is what
[01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:39.220]   Ken Griffin owns in Citadel. This is what Izzy Englander owns
[01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:44.180]   in Millennium. Brevin Howard is another one. D.E. Shaw is
[01:48:44.180 --> 01:48:48.540]   another one. So they have all kinds of strategies, but that
[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:51.820]   are essentially run by computers that allocate risk, you know,
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:55.540]   scale you up, scale you back, turn you on, turn you off, fire
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:48:59.340]   you overnight. And those strategies as a whole ran over
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:03.540]   the market this year. They were the best performers. They are
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:06.980]   giving back billions of dollars, they've generated double digit
[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:11.380]   positive returns. They're raising their fees, in some
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:14.460]   cases, some of these folks are moving their annual fee up to
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:19.940]   4% a year, their carry up to 40% a year. Incredibly,
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:24.740]   incredibly well run performant businesses. They were by and
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:27.220]   away the best investors this year.
[01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:30.300]   Okay, we're gonna go lightning round from here. Saks, do you
[01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:31.940]   have a best investor?
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:35.500]   Yeah, I said, Stan Druckenmiller. He does your
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:38.820]   recall, last year, he predicted that inflation would be lasting
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:42.420]   this is the spring of 2021. When transitory was the word of the
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:46.220]   day. This year, he predicted the bear market rally we had in
[01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:51.460]   July and August. And I remember back at the CO2 summit in May,
[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:54.620]   there were around that time, he was interviewed, and he basically
[01:49:54.620 --> 01:49:59.020]   was saying that as soon as there was a bear market rally over the
[01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:01.980]   summer, that he would then put a short position on I don't know
[01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:04.500]   if he actually did that. But he said he's going to do that. And
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:07.700]   then it turns out that the summer rally that we had was a
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:10.740]   dead cat bounce. So he was right about that. And now he is
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:15.500]   predicting a hard landing in 2023, with a deeper recession
[01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:19.220]   than many expect. So sadly, I suspect he may be right yet
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:19.580]   again.
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:21.980]   Friedberg best investor for you.
[01:50:22.020 --> 01:50:25.860]   2022. I had Druckenmiller I indicated that he's been doing
[01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:28.060]   interviews pretty much every quarter for the last two years.
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:29.940]   And he's been pounding the table telling everyone what's going to
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:32.460]   happen. And it all happened. And he even told people the trades
[01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:36.460]   in mid 2021. He said he was short long dated treasuries, and
[01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:39.300]   he was long commodities. And if you had put those two trades on
[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:41.620]   at that time and held them to today, you would have made a
[01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:45.540]   fortune. And so I think he's extraordinary in his ability to
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:48.340]   kind of see macro in a way that others don't, but also to take
[01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:51.700]   extremely brave action with his portfolio. He's he's renowned
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:55.260]   for how big the bets are that he makes, and how quickly he can
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:58.100]   change his mind when he's wrong and make another big bet to and
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:00.780]   still get himself out of the hole. He's incredible. So I
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:02.780]   definitely give it to Stanley Druckenmiller this year.
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:07.660]   2021. We did our best turnarounds. I picked Disney
[01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:09.580]   Chamath Ford, Friedberg, we were
[01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:10.900]   this category.
[01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:15.260]   What about the worst investor of 2022? Can we do that?
[01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:17.540]   Good. You want to freestyle? Tell us your worst investor of
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:18.060]   2022.
[01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:20.980]   I mean, I'll put myself in the category along with anybody else
[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:23.980]   who was long tech based if Nick if you can just bring please
[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:28.580]   backup this capital asset pricing model. Any of us that
[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:33.340]   didn't understand this got run over this year. And just to put
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:37.660]   some very specific numbers here. There was a decent little tweet
[01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:40.540]   thread that Elon was a part of where he they actually
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:44.820]   calculated what the expected rate of return of Tesla was and
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:49.780]   it turned out to be almost 14% a year. And so you know, when you
[01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:53.060]   start to compound 14% over three, four or five years, these
[01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:57.460]   numbers get very big very quickly. And the reason why is
[01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:00.340]   that it has a huge beta. And we're in a world now where the
[01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:04.980]   risk free rate is quite high. So all of us benefited from this
[01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:08.620]   equation, essentially being upside down for the last 15
[01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:13.540]   years. And all of us who were over allocated into things that
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:17.180]   benefited from those dynamics, frankly got run over this year.
[01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:21.500]   So we were as a class the worst investors of 2022.
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:25.900]   Okay, here we go. Let's do our best turnaround. I am going to
[01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:32.820]   go with me for me. It's meta. They were losing money. hand
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:36.340]   over fist, they refuse to do a rift. And then finally, bestie
[01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:40.380]   Brad Gerstner said, Let's get fit. He did a memo. And finally,
[01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:44.820]   finally, Zuckerberg made some cuts. Reportedly rumors he's
[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:48.580]   making a 15 10 or 15% cut I heard in the back channels
[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:51.460]   right now based on performance. So he's not calling it a riff or
[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:55.500]   a layoff. They're just gonna cut the bottom 10 or 15% again. So I
[01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:59.020]   think Zucks gonna turn it around. Anybody have a best
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:01.660]   turnaround? So you're saying Zuck mission accomplished?
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:06.380]   You're gonna turn around this year. I'm going with meta.
[01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:09.540]   So your answer is meta was turned around by Zuck this year.
[01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:14.220]   Yes, they got down to $85. And now they're up at what? 110 115?
[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:16.500]   Yes, he turned it around at the end of the year. It was like a
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:18.100]   Hail Mary at the end of the year. He's turned it around. I
[01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:19.900]   think he's going to continue to Yes, that is my position.
[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:21.740]   Was your
[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:25.500]   cousin I bought the stock at 94.
[01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:26.540]   Go with that, Jacob.
[01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:29.620]   Okay, so if we're talking about very partial turnarounds here,
[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:34.060]   I would say, I would say that you can measure the turnaround
[01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:39.900]   as of October 24. To now. Yes, exactly. So San Francisco still
[01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:43.620]   overall a mess. But there were a few positive events that
[01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:46.420]   happened over the past year. And since we're looking back, we
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:50.180]   should call these out. So first of all, back, this is towards
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:52.260]   the beginning of the year, we recalled three members of the
[01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:56.900]   school board, most particularly, Allison Collins, remember her,
[01:53:56.900 --> 01:54:03.300]   this was done by something like a 7030 margin and 8020 on on
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:05.940]   Collins. This was the school board that had dragged his feet
[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:09.420]   on school reopenings, they destroyed the merit based Lowell
[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:13.020]   High School, they wasted hours of meetings on a silly plan to
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:16.580]   remove the names of names like Abraham Lincoln from the from
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:20.020]   the schools. In any event, they were removed. Then Jake, how you
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:24.380]   refer to this, we got chase a buddhine recalled by a 6040
[01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:28.860]   margin as San Francisco da. This was the da who whose agenda was
[01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:33.020]   decarceration. He tried to release as many repeat offenders
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:35.940]   as possible. The voters San Francisco had enough and then
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:39.540]   most recently, the far less supervisor Gordon Marr just got
[01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:43.980]   rejected by his own community this November. And the new tough
[01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:47.940]   da Brooke Jenkins got reelected in her own right after being
[01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:51.340]   appointed by London breed. So there's still a long way to go
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:54.100]   in San Francisco. But there are definitely some green shoes
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:57.420]   start that the electorate here has had enough and is looking
[01:54:57.420 --> 01:55:01.900]   for the let's say called the centrist Democrats as opposed to
[01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:02.780]   the radicals.
[01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:06.260]   Okay, we're in the lightning round here. We're in our three
[01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:12.180]   of the all in podcast, marathon, this telethon. Shemoth, you got
[01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:15.860]   a best turnaround for 2022. Hard, hard, hard one to give. So
[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:18.740]   any green shoots for 2022? As Saks would say,
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:21.980]   no, I mean, everything, everything's just got a
[01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:22.540]   disaster.
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:25.540]   Great. freeberg anything that you
[01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:28.940]   there may be no turnaround award until 2025.
[01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:32.780]   Fine. Okay. Yeah. A little split on this freeberg. You got any
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:33.140]   green shoots
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:36.500]   your your incisive fucking viewpoint. I'll pick Zack and
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:37.980]   meta that made so much sense.
[01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:41.140]   94. It's at 117. It's one of my best j trades.
[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:45.180]   Didn't you also say Disney was your pick of the year or
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:47.660]   something? I'm buying more. I'm buying more Disney. I'm buying
[01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:48.340]   more. This is
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:53.580]   I'm telling you Disney Warner, which you talked about before.
[01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:57.580]   Yeah. And Facebook are three of my bit and you know, are three
[01:55:57.580 --> 01:55:59.620]   of my big ones. Let's say worst human being here.
[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:02.420]   Well, I think look, given that this is supposed to be the year
[01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:04.420]   2022. I mean, you got to say that.
[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:07.580]   SPF was the winner of this hands down.
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:11.260]   Okay, congratulations to SPF. You are consensus worst human
[01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:14.980]   being for this year. I mean, not ever, but only for this year.
[01:56:14.980 --> 01:56:19.020]   Right? Yeah, we all hate you equally. Okay, who's who's
[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:22.020]   number two? Why do you hate him? Why do I hate him? Because all
[01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:25.420]   those people lost their money. And you know, there's some pot
[01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:27.780]   it's causing chaos. I feel terrible for all these people
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:31.380]   who lost money. That's why I hate him. Oh, it's disgusting.
[01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:35.180]   Did you see anybody have a second most person? The two guys
[01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:40.540]   copped to please Caroline Ellison and Gary like pancakes
[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:44.020]   flip and but it turns out that they actually did engineer a
[01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:49.820]   backdoor into FTX and has been doing this long. Oh my god. Oh
[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:52.340]   my god. That's game over. You're getting 10 years. He's getting
[01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:53.620]   life game over.
[01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:57.900]   Well, there's an interesting defense strategy that we were
[01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:01.820]   discussing in the chat. Oh, yeah. I think this is
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:04.300]   actually a fascinating defense strategy. I think this is their
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:07.500]   own shot. One of our besties had this theory that he was
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:10.900]   prescribed to prescription drugs. One was Adderall. What
[01:57:10.900 --> 01:57:12.500]   was the other one called? This was
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:17.180]   he said, the patch is it's a drug I wasn't familiar with. I
[01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:19.780]   guess it's a patch. But when you combine these two things,
[01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:23.540]   apparently it basically shuts down or kills the part of your
[01:57:23.540 --> 01:57:28.820]   brain that deals with inhibition inhibition. It's cocaine. Yeah.
[01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:32.260]   What if his defense strategy was Yeah, like only an insane
[01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:36.180]   person would do this. And I was acting insane because I was
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:39.820]   prescribed these drugs that had these drug conflicts. And it
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:42.700]   like killed part of my brain. I mean, and you think about it
[01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:46.820]   every criminal on Wall Street said cocaine is my defense. But
[01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:49.460]   this you could say he was maybe he was legally prescribed if he
[01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:52.700]   could show the prescription. By the way, I'm not saying yes,
[01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:55.980]   should get him off. I'm just, we're basically work shopping.
[01:57:56.300 --> 01:58:00.140]   What is only shot of his defense would be right? Well, and think
[01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:05.980]   about it, sex. He acted manic after FTX collapsed. So that
[01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:11.300]   mania of doing 20 Twitter spaces would be there's something so
[01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:14.820]   insane about what he did, right? That you that all it's almost
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:19.460]   like a like a prescribed insanity defense. Like I was
[01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:22.460]   prescribed a drug combination that made me insane.
[01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:26.140]   Anybody have a most loathsome company has we wrapped the only
[01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:28.340]   way that you could come up with that is like you'd have to have
[01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:30.300]   two parents that were like law professors or something.
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:33.860]   Right? Most most loathsome company.
[01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:35.900]   This is his defense, you know,
[01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:40.420]   yeah, my parents boohoo. No, no, no, he'll claim insanity. J.
[01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:44.380]   Cal. He'll say, of course, yeah. And they'll have a I mean, do we
[01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:46.900]   think that his parents aren't going to help his defense?
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:50.940]   You know, at this point, this, this kid's got to go away for
[01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:51.740]   life. That's it.
[01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:54.380]   You think life? Wow, I think it's got to be life. I think
[01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:57.060]   it's got to be 30 plus years. I mean, it's just going to be
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:59.820]   billions of dollars. What kind of justice system do we have?
[01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:01.660]   When people go away for 2030?
[01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:04.980]   For many years per billion, would you sentence?
[01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:09.980]   A decade per billion at least? Yeah, I mean, just you got
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:13.660]   some proportional sacks, you got to don't you think the justice
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:16.620]   system needs to look at other people who are in jail for
[01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:20.220]   selling cocaine for selling marijuana for for robbing a
[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:23.060]   convenience store, they'll put somebody away for robbing a
[01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:26.100]   convenience store for a decade or two? What are they going to
[01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:28.420]   put him in jail for just because somebody came in with a gun and
[01:59:28.420 --> 01:59:30.700]   robbed a convenience store, they get 20 years, this kid's gonna
[01:59:30.700 --> 01:59:31.260]   get off?
[01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:34.180]   Screw that. Look, I think what do you guys think the over under
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:38.260]   is here? You think it's like set it at I'll set it at 35 years.
[01:59:38.260 --> 01:59:43.620]   I'll take the over. I'll take 30. I think this is made up. I
[01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:45.820]   said a good line, then which I think this is I think this is
[01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:48.860]   made up. No, I agree over on 30. Yeah, I think I think I said
[01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:52.460]   35. I think it's gonna be a multiple hundreds of years
[01:59:52.460 --> 01:59:55.340]   sentence. And you'll be gone for life. Yeah, I think it's gonna
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:58.460]   be life. But I said a good line. Okay, most slow some company is
[01:59:58.460 --> 02:00:00.460]   FTX. Anybody want to go for a second?
[02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:04.020]   No, keep moving. No, I'll add one. I'm gonna this year, I'm
[02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:06.660]   gonna give my last year I gave it to Tyson foods, one of the
[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:09.740]   largest slaughter of animals on earth. This year, I'm going to
[02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:13.620]   give it to a company called innovative I n o t IV. This is
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:17.740]   the company that was busted by the feds for their animal abuse
[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:21.860]   in their dog breeding facility, where 4000 beagles were rescued
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:25.060]   one of which I adopted. And this is a publicly traded company
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:27.780]   stocks down 90 some odd percent, which I'm thrilled to see
[02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:32.900]   terrible business, awful, awful, kind of, you know, inhumane
[02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:36.260]   behavior. And so I want to kind of give them a special shout out
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:36.660]   this year.
[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:40.780]   Look at you. And you're getting the virtue signaling points of
[02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:44.420]   rescuing the dog to increase your Q factor amongst besties.
[02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:44.980]   Well done.
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:49.340]   As a factor, max Q factor. Max Q factor. Yeah.
[02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:50.620]   Anybody else have a low sum?
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:54.500]   Yes, I'd like to pick this company zebra to Babuza, which
[02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:58.580]   destroyed the environment for a bunch of endangered species that
[02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:01.500]   I would otherwise have used for various for pelts for my
[02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:02.420]   sweaters and such.
[02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:05.420]   Yes. And I would like to go with blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:10.700]   which was torturing puppies, 18 of which I rescued and I am now
[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:15.140]   have them in the J cow puppy rescue. I am the most sensitive
[02:01:15.140 --> 02:01:19.860]   and caring person. Also, I would like to add SeaWorld. I am in
[02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:23.660]   the process of raising money to build bigger pools to eventually
[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:26.780]   release all the orcas in captivity. That is my new focus
[02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:31.180]   for next year. Okay. Moving on. Oh, God, do we want to do best
[02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:34.220]   meme? Do we want to do best new tech?
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:35.980]   I'll do best new tech. I don't have a best name.
[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:38.460]   I'm going with fusion for best new tech. I'm going with
[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:41.500]   I'm gonna go with chat GPT. I think what was so impressive
[02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:46.060]   about chat GPT. And the experience that everyone's had
[02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:48.100]   using it is that it really for the first time I think
[02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:53.260]   elucidated where these kind of machine learning tools can take
[02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:56.940]   us and what the kind of new product experience can be what
[02:01:56.940 --> 02:02:00.340]   generative AI can yield things beyond I think the scope of what
[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:03.220]   a lot of people were imagining before. So it was really so
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:06.340]   revealing. And as you guys know, there's an absolute friggin
[02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:09.580]   tidal wave of people trying to start companies that are
[02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:12.900]   leveraging tools and generative AI to kind of reinvent
[02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:16.100]   everything from what workplace tools, enterprise software, all
[02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:18.740]   the way through to media games and entertainment. So that's why
[02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:21.540]   I think chat GPT was the most impressive new technology
[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:24.500]   new tech. And then sacks lightning round, please best new
[02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:24.780]   tech,
[02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:28.340]   alpha fold three, which basically has almost near
[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:29.940]   perfect accuracy and protein folding.
[02:02:29.940 --> 02:02:34.020]   Saks best new tech. I can't improve on the chat GPT. So yeah,
[02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:38.020]   let's keep rolling. Best trend best trend in business and in
[02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:41.580]   the world. Mine is startups getting back and investors
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:43.860]   getting back to reality and the what I call the age of
[02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:46.780]   austerity. The age of focus after the age of excess. That's
[02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:48.820]   the best trend in our world, the age of austerity, what's your
[02:02:48.820 --> 02:02:51.100]   best trend for 2022
[02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:54.900]   marginal cost of energy generation and storage is now in
[02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:58.100]   the low single digit pennies per kilowatt hour, which basically
[02:02:58.100 --> 02:03:01.980]   means that not only will energy be free and abundant, but it
[02:03:01.980 --> 02:03:05.980]   will, I think over the next decade or two, create a massive
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:09.420]   peace dividend, it will rewrite our foreign policy, it will
[02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:12.900]   rewrite national security, that is the reason why people should
[02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:16.340]   care about energy transition, not necessarily climate change,
[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:20.660]   although that's important. It's a distant second to keeping men
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:24.540]   and women out of war, and keeping our borders safe.
[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:27.180]   Well said anybody else have a best try.
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:32.740]   Last year, I said the creator economy, which I think referred
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:35.420]   to all these kind of creators creating new products and
[02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:38.860]   businesses beyond their content. This year, I think that the
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:42.140]   trend that was again enabled and demonstrated through chat GPT is
[02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:44.340]   the narrator economy. I think this is going to be a really
[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:46.260]   important trend going forward. We'll talk about it in the
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:49.460]   prediction episode. But I think the idea that people are and
[02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:52.260]   they're starting to experience this and using chat GPT and
[02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:55.580]   Dolly and other kind of generative AI tools is how much
[02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:59.060]   you can kind of narrate the product you want to see created
[02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:02.180]   and have it created for you on the fly. And I think that that's
[02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:05.060]   a really kind of powerful mind shift for people and frame shift
[02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:08.140]   for people. And I think it really starts to change a lot of
[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:11.060]   the way that people behave, entertain themselves, businesses
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:14.220]   operate, and so on. So I'd call it the narrator economy. And I
[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:16.780]   think it's really kind of starting to emerge. Okay, do you
[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:18.220]   have a trend? Saks?
[02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:23.540]   Yeah, I would say best friend is the growing realization that the
[02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:26.420]   corporate media is failing does not tell the truth. It has an
[02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:29.020]   agenda, more and more people are opting out of it and going with
[02:04:29.020 --> 02:04:32.260]   independent media. I think you know what Elon mentioned, where
[02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:34.340]   we're going to start holding these corporate journalists, the
[02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:37.020]   same standard on Twitter, as regular citizens, they're
[02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:39.740]   outraged by that, but that's a huge step in the right
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:44.020]   direction. The fact of the matter is, is that the press or
[02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:46.980]   the media is the prism through which reality is refracted. And
[02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:49.900]   if it's not giving us an accurate representation of the
[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:52.660]   world, we can't begin to solve our problems, because we don't
[02:04:52.660 --> 02:04:55.340]   have accurate information. And I think more and more people are
[02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:57.780]   waking up from the matrix and realizing that we're living in
[02:04:57.780 --> 02:05:02.220]   this media controlled simulation. And, again, I don't
[02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:06.100]   think we're going to make progress until the this power
[02:05:06.100 --> 02:05:08.980]   that the media seems to have over our reality gets gets
[02:05:08.980 --> 02:05:09.420]   broken.
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:13.220]   Let's go for worst trend. My worst trend is the Fed trying to
[02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:18.100]   play catch up the Fed trying to play catch up. Sorry, buddy. The
[02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:20.140]   Fed trying to play catch up is the worst trend for me
[02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:23.260]   oversteering into the crash. What do you got to mouth for the
[02:05:23.260 --> 02:05:28.140]   worst trend of 20? worst trend was the continued profligate
[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:32.020]   spending by the federal government. We have record
[02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:36.380]   deficits, record debt. And this year, we're ending the year by
[02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:40.140]   adding another $1.65 trillion of spending that nobody can
[02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:43.060]   seemingly account for. It is truly the Christmas tree of
[02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:47.620]   Christmas trees in terms of bills. So we have not gotten
[02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:51.020]   religion yet around being measured in how we spend money.
[02:05:51.020 --> 02:05:54.220]   Good one. Worst trend, sex. Last year, my worst trend was
[02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:58.140]   authoritarianism growing all over the world. And I think
[02:05:58.140 --> 02:06:02.340]   that's pretty decent prediction. This year's worst trend is the
[02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:05.060]   government colluding with big tech to engage in censorship.
[02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:08.020]   This is how they're going to do the authoritarianism. We talked
[02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:10.740]   about it with Schellenberger and Elon, this whole series of
[02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:15.020]   revelations, notice the Twitter files, we can see this collusion
[02:06:15.020 --> 02:06:18.260]   this cozy relationship between the censors at Twitter and big
[02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:23.100]   tech and the bureaucrats at the FBI and DHS and Pentagon. This
[02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:26.740]   is a really disturbing dystopian relationship as we talked about
[02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:30.380]   earlier. And you know, I feel like we spent all this time
[02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:34.500]   talking about the authoritarianism in Russia, and
[02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:37.460]   China, we seem to be obsessed with combating that and going to
[02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:39.900]   war with that. But we don't spend enough time talking about
[02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:42.940]   this growing authoritarianism at home. The media doesn't seem to
[02:06:42.940 --> 02:06:46.780]   want to report on Twitter files at all. Let's focus on stopping
[02:06:46.780 --> 02:06:47.980]   authoritarianism here.
[02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:50.780]   Well said Friedberg, what's your worst trend?
[02:06:50.780 --> 02:06:54.860]   I was trying for 2022 is what I would call interest rate mania.
[02:06:54.860 --> 02:06:57.620]   And I think that this is the mania that we've been caught up
[02:06:57.620 --> 02:07:01.780]   in on this show that other people on our thread, people in
[02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:04.020]   the business community and the investing community, where
[02:07:04.020 --> 02:07:06.620]   everyone's obsession with did the Fed act soon enough or late
[02:07:06.620 --> 02:07:09.460]   enough, and that interest rates ultimately drive success or
[02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:12.100]   failure with building businesses and making good investments. All
[02:07:12.100 --> 02:07:15.580]   right. The truth is, when interest rates go the wrong way,
[02:07:15.580 --> 02:07:19.980]   good investments, you know, can kind of strengthen their way can
[02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:22.620]   can can make their way through those environments, bad
[02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:25.260]   investments cannot, good businesses can make their way
[02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:27.900]   through and bad investments cannot. And so I think our our
[02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:30.340]   mania around the fact that interest rates and the Fed
[02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:33.980]   ultimately drove bad outcomes in businesses and investments is a
[02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:37.100]   flawed kind of assertion. And we all want to kind of get back to
[02:07:37.100 --> 02:07:40.940]   the drunken days where you know, a low interest rate environment
[02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:43.540]   enables us all to be successful and wealthy. And I think that
[02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:45.380]   that's kind of changed. So I think it's time for us to get
[02:07:45.380 --> 02:07:48.300]   away from the interest rate mania and focus more on solid
[02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:50.260]   investing and solid business building.
[02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:52.180]   Okay, here we go lightning round. We got two to go.
[02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:55.900]   Favorite media of 2022. For me, it was Top Gun, House of the
[02:07:55.900 --> 02:07:59.100]   Dragon, White Lotus two, but I'm going to pick my favorite here
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:03.100]   something you may not have heard of the film tar. I highly
[02:08:03.100 --> 02:08:05.860]   recommend it. But I did like those other three tremendously.
[02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:08.380]   What do you got sacks for your favorite media of 2022
[02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:11.420]   House of the Dragon, I guess I enjoyed quite a bit. Like you
[02:08:11.420 --> 02:08:14.380]   did. I'll give a shout out to my movie Dolly land which will be
[02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:17.420]   coming out next summer. If we're going to include podcast
[02:08:17.420 --> 02:08:22.820]   episodes, I would give a shout out to the unheard episode where
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:25.100]   Freddie Sayers interviews john Mearsheimer, the professor of
[02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:28.260]   international relations. He explains the origins of the
[02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:31.700]   Ukraine war and has some really pessimistic predictions about
[02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:34.620]   what might happen next. I suggest everyone watch it if
[02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:37.260]   they want to understand this conflict and where it may be
[02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:37.980]   going next year.
[02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:41.540]   Timothy, have any favorite media for 2022? You want to share?
[02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:45.220]   I thought Yellowstone kicked ass. Absolutely incredible.
[02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:50.540]   There's, I think it's on Hulu. But there's a show with Steve
[02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:55.060]   corral, a little short series called the patient, which is a
[02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:58.660]   serial killer that kidnaps his psychologist and locks him in
[02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:01.900]   his basement to try to help him prevent him killing more people.
[02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:08.460]   I thought it was really, really well done. Never Have I ever
[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:12.100]   latest season, another just brilliant offering from Mindy
[02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:15.220]   Kaling. She's unbelievable. Those are those are probably the
[02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:15.820]   top ones.
[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:18.100]   What do you got freeberg? Any media?
[02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:22.100]   Yeah, I read a book this year that I really liked. It's called
[02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:24.340]   the vital question by a guy named Nick Lane, someone
[02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:28.140]   recommended it to me. It's he's a biochemist, and he kind of
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:30.540]   talks a little bit about the origin of life on earth, it
[02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:33.540]   really ties into this idea that there are certain call it
[02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:36.220]   principles of physics and statistics that make life
[02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:40.300]   predictive and predictable. But I think the way that he kind of
[02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:46.380]   walks through how a lot of things emerge in life, and how
[02:09:46.380 --> 02:09:49.460]   life ultimately kind of developed on this planet are
[02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:51.900]   really well shown. So yeah, I give I give his book a shout
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:53.660]   out. It was a really good read. So
[02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:56.460]   that book, the vital question is incredible. The other one that
[02:09:56.460 --> 02:09:59.420]   he wrote, which is called life ascending. Those two books you
[02:09:59.420 --> 02:10:02.380]   must read if you don't want to be a lot of in my opinion. All
[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:05.380]   right. I will also also for those people who don't
[02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:08.420]   understand the difference between power and energy, you
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:09.380]   will learn what that is.
[02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:11.940]   Very good. I have two book recommendations putting the
[02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:15.060]   rabbit in the hat is Brian Cox, you may know him from
[02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:19.180]   secession. He has a great book and he reads the audio book very
[02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:22.100]   enjoyable. I'm halfway through Quentin Tarantino's cinema,
[02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:24.820]   speculation and enjoying it very much. So actually will enjoy it
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:29.140]   tremendously. Okay. And now we do the Rudy Giuliani Award for
[02:10:29.140 --> 02:10:33.780]   self emulation. This is for the person who poured lighter fluid
[02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:36.060]   and gasoline over themselves and lit themselves on fire for no
[02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:38.980]   apparent reason. I go with Kevin O'Leary, who's secured a $15
[02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:44.420]   million bag from FT x and then decided to try to defend it 18
[02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:48.540]   ways to Sunday burning whatever reputation he had. Who do you
[02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:50.940]   have in your Rudy Giuliani Award?
[02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:53.060]   This will be controversial for you guys. I'm going to go with
[02:10:53.060 --> 02:10:56.620]   Elon Musk. I don't think that he won't put himself in the
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:11:00.860]   position that he did with bad intentions or without paying
[02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:05.180]   attention. I think he's taken on a role in buying and running
[02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:10.740]   Twitter. That is, you know, principled. And, you know, in
[02:11:10.740 --> 02:11:12.340]   his mind, and many other people's minds, a really
[02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:15.700]   important role that someone needs to play. Unfortunately, I
[02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:20.460]   think his reputation has gotten really hurt. Because of, you
[02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:24.380]   know, that role, he's not making a lot of friends. And he's not
[02:11:24.380 --> 02:11:27.340]   he's causing a lot of reputational damage. He
[02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:29.460]   obviously had a lot of good and important things he was working
[02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:32.060]   on prior to taking on the additional burden of Twitter.
[02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:34.900]   And while many people appreciate his doing it, I think that it's
[02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:38.700]   causing him a lot of reputational damage. And so
[02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:42.940]   yeah, I don't mean to kind of be offensive in saying that, but I
[02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:43.700]   think he's he's gotten
[02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:46.860]   a hard thing to do. It's certainly been a hard thing to
[02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:49.740]   do. But you're saying self immolation, Freeberg, because he
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:51.780]   took it on himself. He could have just took it on himself.
[02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:54.580]   Yeah, I'm not saying it's just like, interpretation. Yeah,
[02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:56.940]   it's not it's not like the Rudy Giuliani, Giuliani idiocy. I
[02:11:56.940 --> 02:11:59.300]   think he's taken on the burden of doing this. And I think it's
[02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:00.500]   causing him a lot of reputation.
[02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:03.580]   It's an interpretation of the award. What do you got your
[02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:08.340]   mind? Saxon? Well, I mean, if if I were to interpret the award, I
[02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:10.380]   think the way it was originally intended, I think I got to give
[02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:13.100]   it to Herschel Walker this year, unfortunately, and I wish
[02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:16.700]   Republicans would stop winning this award. At least, Herschel
[02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:21.060]   never gave any speeches next to a dildo shop. But nonetheless,
[02:12:21.060 --> 02:12:26.340]   I am so sorry that I'm so delighted, Saks that you've been
[02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:32.380]   so self aware about the follies of the dying MAGA. The last
[02:12:32.380 --> 02:12:35.020]   throws of the MAGA nation. I want to find some Democrats to
[02:12:35.020 --> 02:12:38.940]   give this to I want to give it to that brain dead senator from
[02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:43.220]   Pennsylvania. What's his name? Fetterman. Thank you. I wanted
[02:12:43.220 --> 02:12:47.900]   to give it to Fetterman, but he won. So I don't know what I'm
[02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:50.860]   supposed to do. You know, it's like, No, listen, when when a
[02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:54.580]   Republican self emulates like Rudy or Herschel or something
[02:12:54.580 --> 02:12:58.340]   like that, they get left out of town. And when the democrat does
[02:12:58.340 --> 02:13:01.340]   it like a Fetterman, they just get elected. So I don't know
[02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:04.220]   what to say. All right, you got any final words here? Good. I
[02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:07.580]   mean, I end this episode to be the longest episode ever. Who
[02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:10.780]   thinks poor, poor producer, Nick, whoever signed the papers
[02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:15.900]   for the whole search and seizure at Mar-a-Lago looks kind of like
[02:13:15.900 --> 02:13:18.940]   an idiot. So that that was not politically as to Okay, I think
[02:13:18.940 --> 02:13:22.900]   you'd say the FBI then okay. poorly handled. That's actually
[02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:25.300]   a great, that's a great one. Actually, if we're going to get
[02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:28.620]   serious for a second, the combination of revelations if
[02:13:28.620 --> 02:13:31.500]   we're going to look over this whole year, remember, Jason,
[02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:35.620]   when I basically spoke up at the time they raided Mar-a-Lago, and
[02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:39.380]   said that it was heavy handed and unnecessary. And now you
[02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:43.420]   tell me guys, for years, Donald Trump is an idiot savant minus
[02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:48.140]   the savant. Why all of you guys just project all of this like
[02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:54.420]   insane, genius, evil level stuff. He's not capable of that.
[02:13:54.620 --> 02:13:58.620]   This is a simpleton who likes attention. He stole a bunch of
[02:13:58.620 --> 02:14:01.060]   souvenirs that he didn't read when I was in the White House
[02:14:01.060 --> 02:14:04.460]   position hasn't read now kept in a box downstairs just to say he
[02:14:04.460 --> 02:14:07.180]   had them. That's exactly right. I was the one who championed the
[02:14:07.180 --> 02:14:10.860]   souvenir. I know he's a souvenir guy. You said he was selling
[02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:13.260]   secrets to the sound. No, I did not say that. I said,
[02:14:13.260 --> 02:14:15.980]   souvenirs. No, just did it. You said
[02:14:15.980 --> 02:14:20.860]   news. Hold on. You were doing Jared Kushner and elaborate
[02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:24.260]   conspiracy theory. I'm saying I know it's not a conspiracy
[02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:27.580]   theory when you do it. And and guys, and this is the same
[02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:30.860]   person that basically, in the in the beginning of his
[02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:35.060]   presidential campaign in 2016, in front of Hillary Clinton said,
[02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:40.100]   Absolutely, I bend the laws that you created the tax laws to my
[02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:43.540]   favor, because I'm not stupid, when she called him a tax
[02:14:43.540 --> 02:14:47.860]   dodger. And it turns out after all these years, he was telling
[02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:48.420]   the truth.
[02:14:48.420 --> 02:14:54.020]   The show ends with Trump. He's been a great 2022.
[02:14:54.060 --> 02:14:56.700]   No, no, but honestly, like, like, did we learn anything
[02:14:56.700 --> 02:15:01.500]   except that these tax laws are egregiously stupid. And the only
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:03.700]   people that are consistently guaranteed to make money in
[02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:06.420]   these tax laws are real estate investors. If you put these two
[02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:10.380]   things together, a real estate investor who happened to be very
[02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:14.260]   poor at his job, which Trump turned out to be packed
[02:15:14.260 --> 02:15:17.180]   billions of dollars of nols that he was able to use to wash his
[02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:20.460]   taxes for years and years. And by the way, and he was clearly
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:23.820]   proud of it. He was just goading the Democrats in not releasing
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:26.820]   them. They went through all this rigmarole. And what did we find
[02:15:26.820 --> 02:15:30.100]   out he had huge nols. He had huge deductions, and he paid no
[02:15:30.100 --> 02:15:32.300]   taxes. Is that shocking to any of us?
[02:15:32.300 --> 02:15:35.020]   It's like it's like Chappelle said, he came out of the house,
[02:15:35.020 --> 02:15:37.860]   told everyone everything you think is going on inside that
[02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:40.260]   house is going on and went back and he walked back inside the
[02:15:40.260 --> 02:15:41.180]   house. Yeah.
[02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:48.780]   Pretty great. All right, listen, for David Sachs. The Rain Man
[02:15:48.780 --> 02:15:53.620]   for the Queen of Kenwa Sultan of Science, David Friedberg,
[02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:57.180]   and the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya. It has been
[02:15:57.180 --> 02:16:00.820]   an honor and a privilege to do this podcast with you
[02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:04.380]   gentlemen. This is the longest show in the history of the pod.
[02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:10.100]   Enjoy everybody. RIP producer next next 48 hours and we'll see
[02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:13.700]   everybody next year. Happy Holidays. Love you bestest
[02:16:13.700 --> 02:16:20.180]   Rain Man David Sachs
[02:16:20.180 --> 02:16:23.060]   I'm going all in
[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:26.140]   And it said we open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone
[02:16:26.140 --> 02:16:26.900]   crazy with it.
[02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:27.980]   Love you bestest
[02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:29.300]   Queen of Kenwa
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:30.860]   I'm going all in
[02:16:30.860 --> 02:16:33.620]   What your winners line? What what your winners line?
[02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:37.220]   Besties are gone
[02:16:37.220 --> 02:16:37.860]   Go 13
[02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:40.780]   That's my dog taking a nudge in your driveway
[02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:41.300]   Sachs
[02:16:41.300 --> 02:16:44.540]   Oh man
[02:16:44.540 --> 02:16:46.660]   My avatars will meet me at the police station
[02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:49.140]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[02:16:49.140 --> 02:16:51.460]   because they're all just useless. It's like this like sexual
[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:53.300]   tension that they just need to release somehow
[02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:56.100]   What your beat
[02:16:56.100 --> 02:16:58.100]   What your beat
[02:16:58.100 --> 02:16:58.700]   Beat
[02:16:58.700 --> 02:16:59.700]   What your beat
[02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:00.700]   We need to get merch
[02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:01.300]   Besties are gone
[02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:03.020]   I'm going all in
[02:17:03.020 --> 02:17:11.020]   I'm going all in
