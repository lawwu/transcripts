[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.320]   - All right, we've got some time now
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.460]   with a true giant in the field.
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.440]   I am excited to participate in this.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.160]   Paul and I have been talking back and forth
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.600]   for the last month or so
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.040]   about what this is going to look like today.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.080]   And we think it's gonna be really good
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.920]   and really educational and really useful for you.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.920]   So let me tell you about Paul, if you don't know.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.200]   Paul is a nationally recognized authority on mutual funds,
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.400]   index investing, and asset allocation.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.040]   After retiring in 2012 from Merriman Wealth Management,
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.920]   which he founded in '83,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.320]   he created the Merriman Financial Education Foundation,
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.220]   dedicated to providing investors of all ages
[00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.320]   with free information and tools
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.040]   to make informed decisions in their own best interest,
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.520]   and successfully implement the Retirement Savings Program.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520]   He is the author of eight books,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.200]   twice as many as I've written,
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.360]   and writes a regular column
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.380]   for the Wall Street Journal's MarketWatch.com,
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.840]   and has a multi-award winning weekly podcast,
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.760]   Sound Investing, which has been named by Money Magazine
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.080]   as the best money podcast.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.960]   In 2008, which was a really important year,
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.920]   don't get me wrong.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.680]   He has also been given a number of awards,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.080]   the American Association of Individual Investors,
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.640]   James Clunan Award for Excellence in Investment Education,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.080]   and as a Distinguished Alumni Award
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.180]   from Western Washington University School of Economics,
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.280]   and perhaps most importantly to him,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.880]   a founding member of GlobalHelp,
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.440]   the Board of Directors of GlobalHelp,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.840]   which is a non-profit that produces medical publications
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.080]   and distributes them to doctors
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.800]   and other healthcare workers in developing nations.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.160]   A very, very wonderful life that you've lived so far, Paul.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.880]   Come on up here, let's get some more wisdom from Paul.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.720]   (audience applauding)
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.560]   - Great.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.680]   Thank you.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.560]   I think this is working, yeah.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.400]   - All right.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.360]   Okay.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.240]   Is this one still on?
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.680]   Keep us both on here.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.320]   Please have a seat, Paul. - Okay.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.480]   - We're gonna talk about factor investing.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.380]   - Wow.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.720]   - And that's a pretty awesome topic, right?
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.600]   Those of you who've followed these discussions
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.760]   for the last five, 10, 15, 20, 25 years,
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.920]   know that there's a fair bit of controversy
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.040]   on the Bogleheads forum these days about factor investing,
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.540]   which is a very different situation than it was in 2004,
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.400]   when I walked onto that forum.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.600]   And so we're gonna talk a little bit about this,
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.420]   but let's start, Paul.
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.040]   Why don't you just tell us what we're talking about
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.520]   when we're talking about factor investing?
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.520]   - Well, when I came into the industry in 1966,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.560]   the way that they differentiated
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.040]   between different kinds of investments,
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.320]   I think mostly were names made up
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.080]   by the marketing departments of the mutual fund companies,
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.080]   things like aggressive growth, capital appreciation,
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.480]   growth and income, dividends.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.640]   And then a number of years later,
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.960]   the academics got involved,
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   and they looked deeper into the premiums,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.160]   the additional returns
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.300]   that certain kinds of investments get.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.200]   And so then we had a whole different way
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.980]   of looking at the returns on investments
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.120]   and legitimate ways to compare.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.240]   And that kind of factor investing then
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.240]   is really using these individual kinds of investments
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.960]   to build a portfolio and to build the portfolio
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.200]   in the hopes that you will have diversification
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.100]   of different kinds of investments.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.900]   And I'll show you some information
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.900]   that just blows my mind how different these things can be.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.040]   So the idea is to get a better unit of return
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.560]   per unit of risk by putting these factors
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.240]   that the academics came up with to use.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.960]   - Okay, so let's get more specific.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.240]   I mean, when I look at the literature on factor investing,
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.640]   there's like 800 factors or 4,000 factors
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.840]   or something that's been identified.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.000]   What factors are actually worth considering
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.280]   for an individual investor like yourself?
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.500]   - Well, I'm almost 81, and I can only do three.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.720]   Value versus growth, size, large versus small.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.800]   And of course, the market is a factor itself,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.400]   the decision whether you're going to be in the stock market
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.760]   or you're gonna be in the bond market.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.560]   And the other one that's been more recently discovered
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.120]   and put to use that looks really great is quality
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.640]   or the financial stability of the companies
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.160]   that are in the portfolio.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.160]   So those are all factors that could then represent companies
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.720]   from all different industries.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.600]   And those are the main ones.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.040]   Other ones are oftentimes hard to get to,
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.800]   expensive to get to.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.320]   Tax-wise, they're expensive to own,
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.760]   but those are the basics that you're going to get
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.760]   in the ETFs that we have choices from.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.760]   - Small value quality.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.360]   - Yeah, and the market.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.080]   - Okay, and of course, the overall market factor.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.680]   Okay, now I promised Rick Ferry
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.360]   I'd ask you all the hard questions today,
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.200]   so I'm definitely gonna ask you the hard questions.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.880]   Here's the first one.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.600]   How do we know this isn't all just data mining
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.240]   and doesn't really exist in the first place?
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.600]   We just pulled it out because we looked at a past data set.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.880]   - Well, let me see if I can show you some numbers.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.840]   Now, by the way, you're gonna see a whole bunch of numbers
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.440]   that you are not gonna be able to read from where you are.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.680]   The good news is we put together a package
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.240]   so that if you go to paulmerriman.com/bh,
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.840]   as in Bogleheads, you can see all this stuff
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.160]   close and up front.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.680]   But let me see, in order for me to go forward.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.000]   There we go.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.920]   All right, all right.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.000]   - I want you to pay attention to the colors here.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.880]   We know you can't read the numbers on this chart,
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.480]   but pay attention to the colors.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.640]   - I had no idea it would be this small.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.440]   The red colors are the S&P 500.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.040]   This is going back to 1928.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.680]   That basically is large growth.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.120]   It's got some value in it,
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.120]   but large growth drives most of that return.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.120]   You can't see it,
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.580]   but there's an electric blue color up there
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.480]   that is small cap value.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.480]   Now, what we know about the S&P 500
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.680]   is it's the highest quality asset class amongst this group,
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.120]   which means it should produce the lowest return.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.120]   But what's interesting is to notice
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.160]   how often the red is at the top.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.680]   In other words, there's a lot of the time
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.360]   that S&P 500 does better than the others.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.160]   And the blue, the small cap value
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.400]   is the most productive asset class,
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   and yet you're gonna see it at the bottom of these
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.700]   from 1928 to 2023.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.840]   What really blows me away,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.840]   this is what factor investing is meant to try to do,
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.200]   and that is that when you put together a 25% S&P 500,
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.620]   small cap value, small cap blend, and large cap value,
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.100]   not only is the compound rate of return
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.240]   about 2% better than the S&P 500,
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.900]   but you can't see it very well.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.620]   But if you could see the brown or the yellow,
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.620]   you would find that that four fund strategy
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.880]   is almost always right in the middle,
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.460]   never number one, never number four.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.180]   And if you wanted to see that
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:22.700]   and have a breakdown of what percentage of the time
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.500]   it ended up in this particular quintiles,
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.600]   you will see the S&P 500 is the least productive
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.600]   41% of the time and the most 28% of the time.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.840]   And when you have time, you will be able,
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.280]   if you are interested in this kind of information,
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.160]   to compare how they did overall.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.000]   And what it leads me to believe
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.960]   is that putting these factors together
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.320]   has a great premium and reward for doing that.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.960]   You just need to know the funds that you do it with.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.120]   - We'll talk about funds here in a minute,
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.420]   but first we gotta talk about something else.
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:09.360]   Paul, I started investing in 2004.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.080]   It's now 2024.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.400]   I've gone from being broke in 2004
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.280]   to being financially independent in 2024.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.640]   And I've been tilting my portfolio
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.720]   to small and value factors almost that entire time.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.840]   It has not paid off.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.840]   I am way behind what I would have been
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.500]   if I had just used total market funds.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.240]   Not only do I have lower performance,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.480]   but I had lower tax efficiency.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.840]   I have higher expenses.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.360]   I mean, when you look at the long-term data,
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.400]   you see the small cap value is outperformed,
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.780]   quality's outperformed, et cetera.
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.540]   But how long is the long run, Paul?
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.240]   How much longer do I have to wait?
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.000]   - Well, let me show you, whoops, not that one.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.180]   Let me show you this one.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.800]   - Yeah, see that really flat one at the end?
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.040]   That's me, that's my entire investing career.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.300]   - Here's the reason that factor investing
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.140]   will not work for some people.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:11.980]   It really is a legitimate long-term strategy.
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.280]   As Warren Buffett says,
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.760]   his favorite holding period is forever.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.500]   The idea is to understand that these asset classes
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.720]   are going to go through ups and downs
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.400]   for very long periods of time.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.160]   And what Jim did was he bought at a time
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.160]   during which small cap value was kicking butt, remember?
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.040]   - Oh yeah, I remember.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.680]   We were all tilting to small cap value in 2004, 2005, 2006.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.240]   - And it had been, as a matter of fact,
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.200]   over about a 15-year period,
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.080]   it doubled the return of the S&P 500.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.720]   And that's when people get attracted to this kind of thing.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.640]   And guess what?
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.200]   What's the likely outcome of chasing performance?
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.000]   It doesn't work very well, right?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.520]   Anybody agree?
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.980]   And so the idea is to understand, I think,
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.060]   that these are asset classes that are meant to be held
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.800]   forever as a part of a portfolio.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.920]   But what this particular telltale chart,
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.420]   and John Bogle developed, as far as we know,
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.360]   the telltale chart, and what it allows us to do
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.520]   is to compare the relative return of the S&P 500,
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.720]   in this case, to small cap value.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.120]   And what do we find out?
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.160]   Over the entire period, it's true that small cap value
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.520]   made about 12 times as much as the S&P 500.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.560]   That's the good news.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.040]   The bad news is that 80% of the time
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.160]   it wasn't adding any value.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.760]   And so it is a type of an investment
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.760]   that you must have the ability to wait out that return.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.640]   And unfortunately, as this is a business of faith,
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.440]   the investment business is faith-based,
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.600]   where we all have our portfolios believing
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.280]   that they're gonna be okay, right?
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.840]   Well, we believe that small cap value
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.400]   will add performance over time.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.480]   But you don't know.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.840]   As a matter of fact, from 1975 to '99,
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.160]   the S&P 500 compounds at 17%,
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.160]   and since then, it has compounded at about 7.5%.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.400]   So that's the reality of being an investor.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.560]   And proper diversification is what you got,
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.720]   is that if you are properly diversified,
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.940]   there are gonna be periods that you're not happy
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.640]   with some part of your portfolio.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.240]   And I am sorry.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.120]   - I'm not blaming you, Paul, for certain.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.960]   - That's good.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.880]   - But okay, let's talk about this.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.960]   Somebody's still convinced.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.960]   They're like, "Oh yeah, man, I'm 25.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.160]   "I can hold on for the long run.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.680]   "This is gonna pay off eventually.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.040]   "I'm really impressed with the data."
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.280]   How much should you tilt your portfolio?
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.240]   How much should go into small value
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   versus the overall market?
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.240]   - Well, in all of these, in that paulmerriman.com/bh,
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.780]   there are about 200 tables there you can look at
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.700]   in charts and graphs and whatnot.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.340]   This is part of a page of one of 'em.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.700]   And what it shows here is the,
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.340]   this goes from 1970 through 2023.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.260]   The rest of the page shows the annual returns.
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.000]   This is the cumulative impact.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.160]   And on the far left, we have the S&P 500
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.160]   compounding at 10.7%, 100% S&P 500.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.420]   When you add 10% small cap value,
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.240]   the return goes from 10.7 to 11.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.220]   This is not life-changing, but it's in the right direction.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.700]   And when you look at the worst six months, 12 months,
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.740]   36, 60 months, the worst drawdown,
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.020]   you will see that the risk of loss
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:15.020]   is almost the same as being 100% in the S&P 500.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.040]   As you move across that page,
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.060]   it keeps getting better and better
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.940]   and at a slow pace for the combination
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.340]   and the additional risk.
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.060]   For example, if we look at 50/50,
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.140]   it looks to me like the worst 12 months
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:36.140]   is a loss of 46% versus 43% with 100% S&P 500.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.820]   Really not much difference.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.820]   And yet the return goes from 10.7 to 12.4.
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:50.180]   Now the challenge we have is there is no risk in the past.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.900]   We always know what we should have done, right?
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.220]   This is what we should have done,
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.540]   but we can't know that it will produce
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.300]   that same kind of additional return in the future.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.660]   But this table is our effort to show people
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.980]   what are the implications of adding small amounts
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.300]   of small cap value, for example.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.140]   And we do the same with the four fund strategy
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.980]   or a three fund strategy.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.460]   The idea is to look at different strategies,
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:29.460]   different combinations and the risk and return historically.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.580]   - You know what I've always said when people ask me
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.380]   how much should I tilt my portfolio?
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.900]   I tell them don't tilt more than you believe.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.580]   You know, if you don't believe very strongly
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.780]   that this is going to outperform in the long run,
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.660]   don't make a big huge tilt.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.940]   If you believe very strongly,
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.900]   you can probably tolerate a larger tilt.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.820]   It's a little bit like the price is right, right?
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.080]   When you're setting your stock to bond ratio.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.900]   You want to get as close without going over
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.180]   your risk tolerance as you can.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.900]   And I suppose it's the same way with small cap.
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.100]   - I totally agree.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:06.100]   As a matter of fact, my own portfolio, equity portfolio,
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.540]   and I'm 50/50 stocks and bonds, my wife and I are,
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.280]   but I'm half small cap and half large.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:19.220]   I'm half value and little more than half value
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.520]   and little less than half growth.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.520]   I'm half US, I'm half international.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.420]   And so I have not played any favorites.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.780]   I have spread it across all of these
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.700]   major equity asset classes.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.300]   And the only difference really here is that
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.740]   typically people build portfolios based on cap weighting,
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.580]   like the total market index or the S&P 500.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.340]   We've been, we have learned from the academics
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.760]   that it is very important to also diversify
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.780]   amongst equity asset classes.
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.420]   That's what they teach.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.940]   I didn't create any of this information.
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.000]   All I've done is learn from others
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.660]   and try to pass it along.
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.940]   - What if they're wrong, Paul?
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.780]   What if you're wrong?
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.300]   What if, what data could come out
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.700]   that would suggest this is a bad idea?
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.780]   That would cause you to bail on this tilt you put in there?
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.280]   - Well, let me see if I can show you here.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.540]   I jumped that one.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.580]   I love this table.
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:32.580]   This table are the results of 15 years of performance
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.340]   from six different small cap value indexes.
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:41.340]   Morningstar and S&P and the MS, Morgan Stanley,
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:47.300]   six major small cap value indexes.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.820]   And the difference each year
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.420]   between the best and the worst is huge.
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.440]   It averages about 3%.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.660]   From the top to the bottom.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.360]   What that tells us is these people
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.560]   are not doing what they do with the S&P 500
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.860]   where the difference between the best and the worst
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.620]   will simply be the expense that is charged.
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.260]   And so you might have a 1/10 of 1% difference
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.780]   for the S&P 500.
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:18.780]   So you can count on that depending on the expenses.
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.860]   That is not true.
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.380]   It is not true with small cap value.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.140]   Or small cap blend.
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:30.160]   People, companies have developed their own
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.020]   and the question you need if you're gonna do this,
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.860]   how do you make sure that you get your money
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.780]   into the small cap value fund
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.940]   that is likely to perform the best?
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.060]   I know, for example, the Russell 2000 value,
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:49.060]   it's a lousy, lousy small cap value index.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:53.240]   And we know why it isn't very good.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.340]   Because it has a lot of companies that are not very stable.
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.500]   They are companies in financial trouble.
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.440]   On the other hand, there are indexes
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.580]   where they have eliminated that part of the portfolio
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.540]   and tilted, another tilt, towards the profitability,
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.180]   towards the quality.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.980]   And what difference might,
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.940]   well I can tell you the last five years,
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.420]   AVUV, a fund that we happen to think highly of,
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.000]   had about twice the return,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   about 88% versus about 34% with a Russell 2000 index.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.440]   They are about the same size companies.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.520]   Everything else about them is very similar
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.680]   except for one thing, the quality of the portfolio.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.800]   So that's why I think the quality is important
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.800]   and size and the value orientation is going to be important.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.200]   And so what we want you to do is,
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.560]   if you're going to do this,
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:01.560]   just be sure that you're getting into those ETFs
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.500]   that represent what we hope, and we can't know,
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.240]   will be the better performers.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.360]   - I'm not sure you answered the question I asked,
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.400]   but you answered one I meant to ask.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.200]   So let's dive into this a little more
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.880]   and then we're gonna go back to the question I asked.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.560]   You're suggesting Avantis is doing a pretty good job
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.360]   with these factor funds.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.960]   Avantis, of course, those who aren't aware,
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.200]   Avantis is a bunch of DFA break-offs
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.400]   that went over there and started doing
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.800]   a bunch of small value ETFs
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.840]   'cause the DFA folks apparently didn't want to.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.040]   Well, now there's DFA ETFs too.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.840]   So Avantis you list as, if you wanna do this,
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.280]   that's a pretty good place to go.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.120]   You're paying 25 or 35 basis points.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.400]   - 25, at DFA you're paying 31.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.260]   - Yeah, and so what else?
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.600]   What about the Vanguard small value funds?
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.720]   - Well, the challenge, what you get with Vanguard
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.040]   is you get a very low expense ratio.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.320]   And what you get from these other organizations
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   like Avantis and DFA is you are getting strategies
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:15.640]   that require more work and they must charge more for it.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.640]   For example, the Russell 2000 Index,
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:25.860]   they rebalance basically or reconstitute that once a year.
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.360]   And when it's reconstituted,
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.220]   there's a cost to the shareholders
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.080]   of getting out of the companies they gotta get out of
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.760]   and getting into the new companies they need to get into.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.800]   Now, what Avantis does is they reconstitute
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   during the year one stock at a time.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.660]   And so they don't wait around for a year
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.500]   and they also are not being burdened with the expense
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.500]   when everybody tries to rush in
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.640]   or everybody tries to rush out.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:03.020]   It is being done at a cost that you're gonna pay more.
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:07.580]   But when you see the difference in return over the years,
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.180]   I think most people would agree
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.380]   that it is worth the price of admission.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:19.300]   And so this is always, if you're talking about the S&P 500,
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:25.020]   obviously, that's an easy decision to make the lowest fee.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.020]   But let's be honest, we can all go to Fidelity
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:34.020]   and we can buy the S&P 500 without any expense at all, right?
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.860]   We can, but we don't because we honor
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.540]   the man that started this.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:44.220]   Which means that there is an emotional part
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.260]   of the decision that we make.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.820]   It's sometimes about who we trust
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.700]   and who we want to do business with.
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.620]   I can just tell you from my knowledge
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.380]   of the people at Advantis and DFA,
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.260]   if you wanna go someplace and get an education,
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.860]   their websites are a great place to get an education
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.240]   about factor investing.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.720]   - You know, it wasn't that long ago
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.280]   that we thought 20 basis points
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.500]   was a great price for a mutual fund.
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:17.460]   And now it's four, three, zero at Fidelity
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:22.140]   that we can, investing has basically become free
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.060]   for the masses now.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.660]   And so we don't wanna pay anything for it,
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.860]   even though not that long ago,
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.060]   20 basis points seemed pretty awesome.
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:33.060]   - I will note that if people go to our website
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:37.400]   and take our recommendations, it's free.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.900]   So we're a Vanguard fan through and through.
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.300]   We're trying to bring it as low cost as we can
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.520]   for what we're doing.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.360]   And what you gotta do, I hope, is check us out
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.600]   to see if we know what we're talking about.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.880]   And all we're doing is bringing what we've learned
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.960]   from the academic community.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.760]   And it shows up in these tables
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.840]   that either we make or other people make
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.440]   to help you make a decision.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.080]   - Okay, now we're gonna go back to that question.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.780]   - Yes, what was that question?
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.380]   - I mean, a lot of this we get from looking back
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.520]   at 100 years of data and we say small value outperformed
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.620]   over that 100 years.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.200]   What kind of data would convince you
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.700]   to stop tilting your portfolio to factors?
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.800]   What if it was so poor for another 20 years
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:32.800]   that it's now underperforming large growth over 120 years?
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.640]   Would that be enough or what would dissuade you
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.120]   from being a factor investor?
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.460]   - This is gonna shock you, but I'm not thinking 120 years.
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.880]   I do not think.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.440]   What would it take for me to decide
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.640]   that there is not a small cap premium
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.780]   or a small cap value premium or a large cap value premium?
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:01.900]   You would have to turn the way people believe
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.740]   that investing works upside down to conclude that.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:09.000]   Because if we can conclude that,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.480]   we could conclude that bonds are better than stocks.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.240]   Now you may think that is crazy, but in 1925,
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.680]   people believed that bonds were investments
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.980]   and stocks were nothing but speculations.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.500]   They did not believe that stocks were a good investment
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.620]   for the long term.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.800]   And they were wrong from what we know
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.040]   about the rest of that story.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.680]   But small cap is more risky.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.340]   Value is more risky.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.480]   There's a reason that they sell
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.560]   for half the P/E ratio of growth.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:47.440]   And so the question is, if they are more risky,
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.920]   will they have to pay a premium
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.840]   for people to put money in those companies?
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.960]   And yes, they will have to, at least as a group,
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.040]   or people will make the decision to get out of them,
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.060]   at which point they'll go down in value
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.320]   and then they'll work.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.360]   But in the long run, it's the way,
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.920]   from everything we know,
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.840]   when we look at this other thing I showed you
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:17.760]   with all those, the quilt chart back to 1928,
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.560]   they all did what they said they were gonna do.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.540]   The S&P 500 had the lowest return.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.680]   Small cap value had the highest.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.680]   Large cap value was second from the bottom.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.640]   And the small cap blend was next.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.480]   And if you go back and look at the years,
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.600]   what you're gonna find this kind of fun,
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.880]   at least my idea of fun,
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.360]   is you're gonna look at a year and say,
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.080]   wait a minute, look at this.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.080]   Small value and large value did the best that year.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.920]   Large blend and small blend didn't do well.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.320]   And sometimes there's a 10, 15, 20, even 30% difference
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.200]   from the top to the bottom.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.120]   Other years, small cap value and small cap blender
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:10.840]   at the top, but large value and large blender at the bottom.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.520]   Obviously, for some reason,
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:17.520]   investors decided to buy more of the small companies
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.000]   than the growth and value too.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.160]   And so you can see every year,
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.320]   and you can make up a story about how investors felt
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.840]   about these different asset classes.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.680]   And what I believe personally,
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.280]   and I don't know if anybody else,
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.680]   'cause this is a judgment
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.360]   that I think many people would disagree with.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:45.360]   I believe the future will look just like the past.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.500]   Now, when I say just like the past,
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.000]   that there will be all these years
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.200]   with all these different configurations.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:58.200]   Like last year, the S&P 500 was up 26%.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.600]   It's been up 25 to 30% many, many times before.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.480]   There's nothing new about that.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:12.400]   It's just the market continues to reproduce returns
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.360]   as it has in the past.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.240]   Not exactly, but close enough to say,
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.000]   well, I guess it does.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.280]   The problem is it's the sequence of returns.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.360]   I don't have any idea
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.880]   what the sequence of returns is gonna be.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.960]   I just know that the returns are gonna flip-flop around.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.640]   As a matter of fact, you probably know this,
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.800]   but from 1929 to 1938,
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   the S&P 500 had a better return
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.400]   than from 2000 to 2009.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.480]   They looked almost the same,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.120]   except it was more volatile back in the '30s
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.680]   because there was less money in the market.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.960]   And so the little bit of money
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.560]   pushed the market around quickly either way,
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.960]   which today there's a lot more liquidity than we had then.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.440]   But the total 10-year period,
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.240]   it looked worse 2000 through 2009.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.920]   We didn't see suplines.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.680]   We didn't see the impact of it,
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.520]   but we saw the numbers.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.960]   And I just believe the numbers are gonna be there again.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.440]   I just don't know when,
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.640]   which makes that worthless information,
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.400]   except that maybe if you believed all of that,
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.720]   you would say, "Ah, I will have some in small,
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.280]   "and I will have some in value,"
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.880]   because it will all come over time.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.360]   - All right, I've got one more topic
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.400]   I wanna discuss with you.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.040]   But those collecting questions,
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.280]   if you can bring those up, that'd be great.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.520]   So it sounds like you mostly believe it's a risk story.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.560]   That's why the outperformance is there.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.560]   How much can be attributed to behavior,
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.360]   that people just wanna own the invidias of the world?
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.200]   - John Bogle, I just got out my old copy,
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.600]   in fact, not the old copy,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.640]   the updated copy from 2017
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.200]   of "The Little Book of Common Sense Investing."
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.800]   And what he says, he differentiates
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.960]   between investment return and speculative return.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.560]   And one of the things I find fascinating,
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.640]   I had forgotten about this,
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:30.640]   is that we could be right on all the economics
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.480]   and the country could make a certain amount of money.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:41.200]   And we don't know what premium people
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.920]   are gonna be willing to pay for securities.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.680]   For example, in his study in the book,
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.680]   in 1980s and '90s, people paid over 7% a year
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.440]   what he calls speculative return.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.960]   It did not have to do with the economics of the firms.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.400]   It had to do with what people were willing to pay
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.640]   to get to pay to play, if you wanna look at it that way.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:11.040]   Other years, like the '70s, people weigh underpaid.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:16.680]   And the problem we have is not only can we not know
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.920]   what kinds of returns are gonna follow,
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.520]   what kind of returns,
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.480]   but we have no idea what that speculative aspect
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.480]   is going to be.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.760]   But here's what he says in the book.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:33.880]   His study shows that 9.5% of that 10% that people got
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:39.920]   from 1928 to whatever time this book was updated,
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.080]   9.5% was from economics.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:49.080]   One half of 1% came from speculation.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   Which says that, by God, when people are paying 7% more
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.200]   a year for the earnings of companies,
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:03.040]   and they do that over a 20 year period,
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.720]   you got a heck of a lot of risk looking at you there.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.520]   And did we see it?
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.960]   Yes, we saw it from 2000 through 2009,
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.200]   because we lost money for 10 years
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.800]   after having 20 years of being over,
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.560]   of people willing to be overpaying for the earnings
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.360]   that these companies produce.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.720]   - Okay, let's take a question from the audience.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.400]   Academic research shows that machine learning models
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.520]   outperform Fama-French three factors,
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.360]   even Fama-French five factor models.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.200]   Do you think AI machine learning
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.120]   will change the factor investing radically?
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:48.720]   - Well, I do believe that whether it will or will not,
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.920]   that it will convince people
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.920]   and everybody will have a market timing system based on AI.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.320]   Everybody will have a, now when I say market timing,
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.240]   it could be just a numbers based,
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.960]   trend following kind of market timing system.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.000]   It could be a system based on economic factors,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.720]   inflation, et cetera.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.800]   But people are going to be able to look
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.680]   at the past more carefully.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.680]   I mean, look how far we've already come.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.120]   We've come in the last 30, 40 years
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.440]   from not knowing that there was a small cap premium
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.600]   or a value premium and just really the last 10 or 15,
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.080]   I think quality became something that was been recognized.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:40.080]   So there's no reason to think it won't find more.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.720]   The question is how will we control the emotions
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.480]   of the people that follow all this?
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.040]   And the bottom line is we've come a long way.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.640]   This room is filled with people
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.360]   who really do believe in index funds.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.080]   And you're not alone.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.480]   It's just a lot of other people
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.080]   have something else going on this weekend.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:05.080]   But the fact is the society now believes in index funds
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.920]   and that changes the scope of investing
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.920]   because it means in theory, if I'm an investor,
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.640]   I just keep investing in my 401(k)
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.520]   and I trust that it's gonna be okay.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.320]   So I don't stop investing when the market goes down
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.040]   because I own an index fund
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.600]   and index funds are to be trusted under all conditions.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.880]   It may be that argument will work
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.880]   and people will stay the course.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.160]   That changes things.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.220]   I don't know exactly how,
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:39.160]   but I do know it means that more people
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:43.340]   are buying whatever the company is and holding it.
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.480]   Now, it also implies to me,
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.040]   it's the kind of thing that's,
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.160]   I'm a catastrophic thinker.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.960]   My wife brings up any topic
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.880]   and I immediately think of all the reasons
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.200]   that's a scary thing to do.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.120]   Just where my mind goes.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.800]   My mind goes when I think of everybody investing
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.320]   and believing that we should buy and hold,
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.780]   I think what the heck happens
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:11.680]   when that is a tipping point and they stop believing that.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:17.000]   And what a lot of you may not know in the '60s,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   there were times when people wanted to sell 100 shares
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.940]   of an over-the-counter stock,
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:28.560]   not on one of the big exchanges,
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.520]   they wanted to sell 100 shares and there was no bid.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.560]   It was called WO, workout.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.060]   We'll sell you 100 shares for 12,
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.400]   but we will not quote you a price
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.040]   to buy that 100 shares from you.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.440]   So you don't know that today.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.320]   You think you have this liquidity
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.600]   that we can always get out with a little tiny spread
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.520]   between the bid and ask.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.320]   I don't know what it's gonna be like
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.120]   when everybody heads for the door at the same time.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:04.220]   And like most of us, we plan on the society going straight
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.380]   and starting to live within our means after we die.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.480]   Okay?
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.580]   Our kids have to take care of that.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.220]   I guess I'm like everybody else.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.340]   I feel that's gonna happen someday, but I'm gonna be dead.
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.540]   - Paul, our time is now gone,
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.400]   but thank you so much for coming and sharing with us.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.020]   (audience applauding)
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:27.860]   - Thanks, Jim.
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.100]   (audience applauding)
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:41.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
