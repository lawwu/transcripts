[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.080]   [ding]
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.200]   But I think that's good advice.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.640]   Don't be a follower, be a student, right?
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.160]   Take advice but not orders.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.040]   Take information but don't let somebody, you know, order your life.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.680]   Make sure what you do is the product of your own conclusion.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.680]   Excellent note to make.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.760]   Make sure what you do is the product of your own conclusion.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.320]   Not to do what someone else says.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.520]   Take what someone else says, process it, think about it, ponder it.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.440]   If it makes you wonder, if it makes you think, then it's valuable.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.160]   Then when you go take action, make sure that the action is not what somebody told you to do.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.800]   Make sure the action is the product of your own conclusion.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.400]   If you'll follow just a little bit of those simple guidelines,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.880]   I'm telling you the learning process can be speedy, swift, powerful.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.320]   Your learning curve can go up and then applying it to your business, your life,
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.520]   your family, conversations, equities of all kinds.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.800]   You'll find some progress like I did that first five years
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.320]   when I met a teacher willing to share with me, turn my life around.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.440]   Progress I couldn't believe happened for me.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.200]   Okay, let's get started.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.880]   I want to review, I was here last time and we talked about the five major pieces to the life puzzle.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:54.160]   And I just want to review those because it lays such a good foundation for all the rest
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.440]   that I want to share with you today.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.960]   We got a lot of subjects to cover, so we're going to go rather swiftly.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.440]   Okay, put on your mental track shoes here and run with me today
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.560]   because I'm going to deal mostly in concepts, expect you to, you know,
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.080]   fill in a lot of the details because I've got a lot to share.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.280]   I want to get through it all.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.240]   But let's lay this foundation again of the five major pieces.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.920]   Happens to be the title of my latest book,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.120]   but I think it is so valuable in laying a foundation.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.200]   It's some of the things I learned between ages 25 and 30.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.080]   The teacher who taught me, taught me so well.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.160]   He dealt in these fundamentals, we call these fundamentals.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.520]   We call these basics.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.840]   Basics for sports, fundamentals for sports, fundamentals for your business,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.520]   fundamentals for the way you deal with your family, a few simple things,
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.080]   a few basic things that if you practice every day can make all the difference in the world,
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.360]   how it works out.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.480]   I've boiled it down to five major pieces to the life puzzle.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.520]   Let's just review those.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.440]   Number one is philosophy.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:04.320]   Philosophy, as I taught the last time I was here, philosophy, in my personal opinion,
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.080]   is the major determining factor in how your life works out.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.520]   Philosophy, the major determining factor in how your life works out.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.760]   Philosophy, to form our philosophy, you got to think, you got to use your mind,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.240]   you got to process ideas.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.440]   And this whole process over a lifetime, starting way back here when we were children,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.080]   schools that we've attended, our parents, our experiences,
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.920]   all this stuff that we've processed by the thinking process
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.600]   helps to develop our philosophy.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.400]   And in my opinion, each person's personal philosophy
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.960]   is the major factor in how your life works out.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.280]   Here's what I called it in that last presentation when I was here.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.200]   It's called the set of the sail.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.280]   Each person's personal philosophy is like the set of the sail.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.960]   Now, I used to think it was circumstances that ordered my life.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.360]   If someone would have asked me at age 25,
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.040]   "Mr. Owen, how come you're not doing well?
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.520]   Penny's in your pocket, creditor's calling, nothing in the bank,
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.800]   behind on your promises to your family.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.400]   You live in America, 25 years old,
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.040]   got a beautiful family, every reason to do well,
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.960]   and things are not going that well for you.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.680]   What is wrong here?"
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.240]   It would not have occurred to me to blame my philosophy.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.760]   I mean, it would not have occurred to me.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.600]   Say, "Well, I got this lousy philosophy
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.360]   and that's how come I got pennies in my pocket
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.600]   and nothing in the bank and things aren't working well."
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.880]   That would not have occurred to me.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.240]   I found it much easier to blame the government,
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.520]   much easier to blame the tax problem.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.440]   I used to say taxes are too high.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.520]   Top tax rate when I first started paying taxes, 91%.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.280]   Back then when your income reached a certain level,
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.720]   all your income over that, 91%.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.680]   So I used to say that's too high.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.160]   Now the top tax rate's about 33%,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.400]   but people are still saying what?
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.160]   Taxes are too high.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.920]   See, but you can't use that anymore.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.960]   If it's gone from 91 to 33, how could it be too high?
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.720]   Come on.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.840]   I threw all that old excuse stuff away.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.800]   Some people found it though, and they're using it these days.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.360]   My old list.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.880]   I used to blame the traffic, the weather,
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.000]   used to blame circumstances, right?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.160]   People say I'm too tall, I'm too short, I'm too old.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.800]   I was raised in obscurity, raised on a farm,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.960]   parents of modest means, all this stuff.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.000]   If you would ask me, "How come you find yourself here, Mr. Rohn,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.280]   age 25, living in America, land of abundance and opportunity,
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.840]   pennies, zero in the bank, not doing well,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.280]   creditor's calling,"
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.280]   it would not have occurred to me to blame my philosophy.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.880]   I found it easier to blame the company, company policy.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.120]   I used to say, "If this is all they pay,
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.480]   how do they expect you to do well?"
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.680]   So I figured that, you know, my future was going to be tied
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.320]   to what everybody else was arranging, the economy and,
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.160]   right, interest rates.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.040]   I used to say things cost too much.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.920]   That was my whole explanation, not my philosophy
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.320]   until my teacher taught me better
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.520]   that this is where the problem was, my own personal philosophy.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.280]   Here's what's exciting about each person's personal philosophy.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.160]   That's what makes us different than dogs and animals and birds
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.480]   and cats and spiders and alligators.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.800]   That's what makes us different than all other life forms.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.360]   The ability to think, the ability to use your mind,
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.360]   the ability to process ideas and not just operate by instinct.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:44.960]   In the winter, I'm telling you, the goose can only fly south.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.000]   What if south doesn't look too good?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.480]   Tough luck.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.520]   It can only fly south.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.000]   But see, human beings are not like a goose, can only fly south.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.320]   I mean, you can turn around, go north, you can go east,
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.800]   you can go west, you can order the entire process of your own life.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.480]   And we do that by the way we think, we do that by exercising our mind.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.920]   We do that by processing ideas and come up with a better philosophy,
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   a better strategy for our life, goals for the future.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.240]   Okay, plans to achieve those goals.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.480]   All this comes from developing our philosophy.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.960]   Philosophy helps us to process what's available.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.160]   Well, when we get here, we got seed and we got soil and we got some rain
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.840]   and we've got some what? Sunshine and we've got some seasons.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.200]   And what? The miracle of life.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.800]   Now, the key is what do you do with all this stuff?
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.440]   How do you turn all this stuff that's available here into equity
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:58.560]   and promise and lifestyle and dreams and future possibilities?
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.600]   All of this that's possible now with human beings,
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.800]   how do you take all this stuff and turn it into this equities and values?
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.640]   Well, it starts with philosophy.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.680]   What is the seed? What is the soil? What is the sunshine? What is the rain?
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.040]   Is it possible to take some of each of all the stuff that's available
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.360]   and turn it into food and turn it into value and turn it into nourishment,
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.680]   turn it into something spectacular and unique that no other life form can do?
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.560]   And the answer is yes.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.600]   But you cannot deal with all this stuff and what to do with it
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.840]   unless you start refining your philosophy.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.320]   Think, use your mind, come up with ideas and strengthen your philosophy.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.560]   So the seed and the soil and the rain and the sunshine,
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:46.480]   this is called the economy and the banks and the money and the schools
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.480]   and everything that's available out there, processing information,
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.680]   what to do with all that and turn it into equity and value.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.120]   That is the major challenge of life, my personal opinion.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.400]   So each person's personal philosophy now is going to determine
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.440]   what you're going to do with seed and soil and sunshine and rain,
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.680]   miracle, the change of seasons.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.760]   That's it, my personal opinion.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.720]   Each person's personal philosophy is like the set of the sail.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.600]   That's what this seminar is for today, help you to trim a better sail.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.720]   You don't need a better economy.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.480]   You don't need better seed and soil.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.320]   In fact, when it comes to seed and soil and rain and sunshine and seasons
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.840]   and the miracle of life, that's all you got.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.520]   Now, what if you blame this stuff?
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.200]   Then you're blaming all you got.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.360]   If you blame the economy and you blame the schools
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.240]   and you blame the teachers and you blame the sermons and the preachers
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.040]   and you blame the marketplace and you blame the company and company policy,
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.000]   what else is there?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.520]   When some people get through with their blame list, there is nothing else.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   That's all there is.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.560]   And if you blame the only thing you've got to work with,
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.440]   I'm telling you, it's called mistake colossal
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.720]   in not understanding that that's all you've got to work with.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.560]   And if this is all you've got to work with,
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.080]   then you don't change the seed and you don't change the soil
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.440]   and you don't change the rain and you don't change the sunshine.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.760]   You don't change the seasons, right?
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:24.480]   Guy says, I'll take three springs, four summers, nine falls, no winters.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.760]   No, you can't fool with this stuff.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.360]   You got to take it like it comes.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.760]   Then what do you change to make your life work well?
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.160]   You got to start with your philosophy.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.360]   Guess what I had to do at age 25 in order to change my own future.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.800]   I had to change my mind.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.160]   I had to change my thinking.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160]   I had to change my philosophy.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.240]   I was messed up on what was causing my problem.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.760]   And once I got that straightened out, that all the stuff I blamed,
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.280]   the government and taxes and the marketplace and the economy
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.960]   and things cost too much, negative relatives, cynical neighbors.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.280]   Once I got rid of that and started going for where the real problem was, which was me,
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.040]   I'm telling you, my life exploded into change.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.840]   My bank account changed immediately.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.280]   My income changed immediately.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.520]   My whole life took on a whole new look and color immediately.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.720]   And the early results I got from making these philosophical changes tasted so good.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.200]   I've never stopped the process from that day until this.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.000]   And I'm telling you with a little consideration of the refinement of your sale,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.600]   by setting a better sale, refining your philosophy,
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.600]   your whole life can start to change from today on.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.520]   You don't have to wait till tomorrow.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.040]   You don't have to wait until next month.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.400]   You don't have to wait till spring.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.960]   Don't have to wait till 93.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.920]   You can start this whole process immediately.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.720]   I recommend it.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.800]   Now, some people do so little thinking they don't even have their sale up.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.000]   I mean, you can imagine where they're going to wind up at the end of this week,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   at the end of this month, at the end of this year.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.120]   Now's the chance to change, process all this information.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.960]   So number one is philosophy.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.440]   Okay.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.760]   And we dealt with all that where we get ideas
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.200]   from personal experience, from other people's experiences.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.560]   I don't want to get into all those details
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.080]   because we covered that the last time I was here.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.600]   But philosophy, that's number one, my personal opinion.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.320]   Each person's personal philosophy.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.160]   Here's the definition of success and failure.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.120]   Just make this note.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.080]   Here's failure.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.440]   A few errors in judgment
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:29.040]   repeated every day.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.680]   Now you can automatically assume, Mr. Rohn, I say, I can understand that.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.800]   A few errors in judgment repeated every day for six years.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:45.440]   I'm with my father.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.200]   I think I told this story the last time I was here.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.560]   My father, 88 years old.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.360]   He's never been ill.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.400]   Still hasn't retired.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.080]   Not long ago, midnight, we're getting ready to go to bed.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.080]   We've drilled a new well, got some extra water,
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.840]   got some more acres going.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.800]   He's all excited.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.840]   At midnight, we're getting ready to go to bed.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.880]   My father's eating what he calls his midnight snack.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.320]   A little bite to eat before you go to bed.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.440]   Don't have to go to bed hungry.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.560]   And I'm watching him eat this midnight snack.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.440]   Guess what he had?
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.520]   An apple, a few graham crackers, and a glass of grapefruit juice.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.600]   I said, no wonder my father's so healthy.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.840]   My mom taught us all those good health practices.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.200]   It taught me when I'm growing up, right?
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.000]   I'm an only child.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.280]   I've never been ill.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.520]   Passed the big five-oh sometime ago.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.920]   My two daughters, 32, 33, never been ill.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.200]   My grandkids never been ill.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.880]   I'm telling you, the legacy lingers on.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.720]   As I watched my father have this midnight snack,
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.680]   suddenly it occurred to me.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.000]   I know that's part of it.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.200]   An apple, what?
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.800]   A day, that's gotten to Dallas-Fort Worth, right?
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.440]   An apple,
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:51.760]   an apple, a day, keeps the doctor away.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.760]   Good question for this intelligent audience.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.720]   What if that's true?
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.560]   You say, well, Mr. Owen, if that's true,
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.680]   that would be easy to do.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.560]   Then what's the problem?
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.760]   It's easy not to do.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.560]   It's easy not to adopt it as your own personal philosophy.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.400]   Or the guy messed up to say.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:12.560]   Guy says a Hershey bar a day, say no, no.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.120]   You've been watching too much television.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.840]   It is not Hershey bar.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.880]   You gotta be smarter in philosophy.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.640]   Then to fall for the Hershey bar a day,
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.680]   when it's an apple a day.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.920]   You gotta be smarter than that.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   And if you make that kind of an error in judgment
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.440]   every day for six years,
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.680]   I'm telling you, it'll accumulate into disaster.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.200]   Sometimes the first year you say, well,
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.400]   you know, I'm so healthy now.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.440]   What difference is it gonna make?
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.800]   You gotta be smarter than that.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.280]   Just because disaster doesn't follow you,
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.480]   doesn't mean you're gonna be smarter.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.720]   Just because disaster doesn't fall on us
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.600]   at the end of the first day,
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.120]   doesn't mean disaster isn't coming.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.360]   You gotta be so smart that you look down the road and say,
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:04.320]   will the errors in my present judgment of philosophy,
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.120]   what's that gonna cost me in one year, six years,
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.880]   one month, six months.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.520]   I'm telling you the money cost and the health cost
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.320]   and the success cost is too gigantic.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.320]   If you'll look down the road a little ways and say,
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.240]   are there errors in my current judgment
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.880]   like an apple versus a Hershey bar?
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.160]   Is that just a good illustration
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.080]   of some of the rest of my errors in judgment?
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.200]   If it is, that's where I found myself at age 25.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.800]   I started working when I was 19.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.760]   I met my teacher who helped turn my life around
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.520]   when I was 25, that's six years.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.880]   At the end of the first six years of my economic life,
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.320]   I've got pennies in my pocket.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.080]   I've got nothing in the bank.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.440]   The creditors are calling saying,
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.840]   "Hey, you told us the check was in the mail."
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.400]   I'm embarrassed, I'm behind on my promises.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.520]   I live in America, I'm 25 year old American male.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.760]   I got a nice family, every reason to do well.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.840]   And I'm messed up.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.080]   Now what's messed up?
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.080]   I used to think it was the community that was messed up
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.920]   and the country was messed up
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.520]   and the government was messed up.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.240]   If those Democrats ever get in the White House,
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.760]   that'll really mess things up.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.680]   If the Republicans stay in power,
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.200]   that'll really mess things up.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.560]   The economy was messed up, interest rates are messed up.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.560]   I thought all this stuff was messed up.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.440]   Then I found out that's not what was messed up.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.240]   I was criticizing the only thing I had to work with.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.600]   What was really messed up was my own personal philosophy.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.720]   My own errors in judgment in my own personal philosophy
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.480]   brought me in six years to pennies in my pocket,
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.800]   nothing in the bank and trying to explain
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.440]   why I wasn't doing well living in America.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.360]   25 year old American male,
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.960]   got a family, every reason to do well.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.520]   Now, once I understood this,
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.680]   here's the formula for failure,
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.120]   errors in judgment,
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.960]   being lax about developing your own personal philosophy.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.160]   I'm telling you, it's called accumulated disaster.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.720]   It doesn't matter whether it's your health
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.600]   or your bank account.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.480]   Guy's got an empty bank account,
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.920]   probably has high cholesterol.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.080]   Why?
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:08.960]   Over the last six years,
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.560]   he never paid attention to either one.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.920]   And it doesn't matter whether it's a dollar
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.880]   or whether it's your money
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.800]   or whether it's your cholesterol count.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.680]   All you got to do is commit the errors
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.680]   and just because disaster doesn't fall on you
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.240]   at the end of the first day that you don't eat an apple.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.680]   You say, well, I didn't eat an apple today
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.120]   and tonight I'm not ill.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.720]   Well, you gotta be brighter than that.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.600]   Someday you gotta leave first grade.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.880]   The reason we make those first grade desks so small
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.320]   so they won't fit at age 25.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:38.880]   I mean, right?
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.800]   You don't belong here anymore.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.540]   Come on.
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.020]   Now, let me give you the secret to success.
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.140]   The formula for failure,
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.780]   a few errors in judgment repeated every day for one month
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.140]   starts the weakness, starts the disaster process.
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.620]   You can imagine what happens in six years.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.700]   Now here's the formula for success.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:12.100]   A few simple disciplines practiced every day.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.220]   And you've started a whole new process called a whole new life.
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.540]   A few simple disciplines practiced every day.
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.940]   And if you decide today to go for the apple
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.140]   instead of the Hershey bar,
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.820]   I'm telling you, you have begun the process
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.940]   of turning your life around.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.180]   And if you keep up that process,
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.860]   not only with your health habits,
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.140]   but with your money habits
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.020]   and with your communication habits,
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.020]   with your sales habits and management habits
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.380]   and every other habit that you've got.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.140]   If you'll start that process,
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.220]   eliminate the errors
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.500]   and replace it with disciplines practiced.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.780]   I'm telling you, you can start this process of life change immediately.
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.940]   After today, you don't ever have to be the same again.
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.260]   Only by choice.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.900]   You don't have to walk out of here the same
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.940]   as you walked in today.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.020]   Only by choice.
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.940]   You can start a whole new process.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.700]   And you say, well, Mr. Owen, is it that simple?
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.500]   Yes, it's that simple.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.780]   Where else would you start?
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.660]   But with an apple.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.140]   You don't have to start with something staggering.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.020]   What if you should be walking around the block
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.300]   for your good health and you don't?
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:14.260]   What will that do in six years?
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.060]   I'm telling you, the word is disaster.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:22.580]   You could and you should and you don't.
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.100]   Here's an even stronger word.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.300]   You won't.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.300]   I mean, don't might mean you're careless.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.980]   Won't probably means you're stubborn.
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.620]   And either one is called disaster.
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.740]   Could, should,
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.740]   don't.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.460]   I'm telling you, that's why at the end of five years,
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.740]   I've six years, I found myself with pennies in my pocket.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.780]   Nothing in the bank.
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.900]   Creditors calling.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.300]   Could, should, won't.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.940]   Could, should, don't is called disaster.
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.900]   Now, how do you change all that?
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.100]   The next six years, I got rich.
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.620]   The next six years, I became a millionaire.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.860]   By the time I'm 31, I'm a millionaire.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.860]   How about that?
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.820]   You say, well, Mr. Rowan, what happened?
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.300]   Well, strangely enough, during that second six years
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.100]   of my economic life, the government was about the same.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:15.940]   I'm telling you, taxes were about the same.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.140]   My negative relatives were the same.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.020]   I'm telling you, the economy was about the same.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.540]   And prices were about the same.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.380]   And everything else was about the same.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.180]   Circumstances were about the same.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.300]   Then how come I got rich?
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.820]   How come I totally changed my life?
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:31.700]   I was not the same.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.580]   Somebody says, well, what did you go to work on to do all that?
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.580]   I started with my philosophy.
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:41.620]   I started amending my errors by doing some better thinking,
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.780]   changing my mind, coming up with ideas
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.260]   that I didn't have before I met my teacher.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.860]   And once that whole process started for me,
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.060]   I'm telling you, I changed my whole life.
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.540]   Within a six year period, I was never the same.
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.580]   And I've kept up that process all these years.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.780]   One of the reasons why I'm here is to continue my craft.
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.020]   I don't want the day to come someday.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.940]   Somebody says, you should have heard Jim Rohn
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.620]   10 years ago when he was really terrific.
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.380]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.500]   Guess what I want people to say.
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.300]   I heard him 10 years ago, but you should hear him now.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.540]   I'm telling you, the man works on his craft.
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.460]   I'm telling you, the man's done some extra reading.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.380]   I'm telling you, the man doesn't miss a trick.
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.620]   I'm telling you, he's worked hard on himself.
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.620]   That's why he's able to deliver like he does.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.820]   The same thing can happen for you as a teenager.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.060]   It can happen to you as a mother, as a father,
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.900]   as a business person, as a salesperson, running a business.
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.340]   It doesn't matter.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.420]   Management, wherever you find yourself,
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.060]   this is the process called personal change.
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.460]   And what I say to start with is start with your own philosophy.
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.780]   Your philosophy is going to determine whether or not
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.660]   you go for the disciplines or continue the errors
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.140]   that's called potential disaster.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.100]   And everybody has it within their power.
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.380]   Well, it was so happy for me to find out at age 25,
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.020]   Mr. Shove said, Mr. Rohn, you don't have to change countries,
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:02.180]   but you do have to change philosophy.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.980]   And if you'll change philosophy, not country,
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.260]   you can turn around your income.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.540]   You can turn around your bank account.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.980]   You can turn around your skills.
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.940]   You can become capable, powerful, sophisticated,
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.220]   healthy, influential, all the other equities
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.020]   that you could possibly want out of your life
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.660]   using the only stuff there is
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.460]   and not trying to change any of this stuff.
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:28.100]   Appreciate all of this stuff with all of its ups and downs,
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.500]   with all of its mystery of why it works.
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.700]   And sometimes it doesn't work.
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.460]   Don't challenge this.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.700]   You don't have to ask for another planet.
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.100]   You don't have to ask for another country.
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.020]   Just ask for another book.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.940]   Ask for another seminar.
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.780]   Ask for another idea.
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.860]   And you can start this whole process of personal life change.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.540]   Now I could spend the whole day on philosophy
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:50.500]   because that's where it is.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.980]   If I could get you intrigued with that enough to study it,
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.620]   enough to ponder it to where you'd pick up the commitment
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.420]   like I did and say, hey, as simple as an apple a day,
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.940]   as simple as a walk around the block,
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.140]   why not start right there?
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.460]   If you don't start there, where else are you going to start?
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.140]   Might as well start where it's easy
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.980]   and then go to the more complicated disciplines.
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.940]   Because if you can't handle the complicated,
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:10.820]   the simple disciplines,
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.500]   how can you handle the complicated ones?
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:22.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
