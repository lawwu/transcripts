[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:19.620]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.760]   Each week we get questions into our inbox
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.400]   at askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.400]   People reach out to us on social media.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.640]   We get some YouTube questions.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.080]   Sometimes people just shout at us on the street.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.280]   And I think we hit a new all-time record
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.720]   for questions this week.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.560]   This is unofficial.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.000]   - There's a lot. - That's what I'm putting it in.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.760]   And every single question touched on the exact same theme.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.920]   Is my money safe?
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.920]   This is the kind of risk no one knew
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.160]   they needed to worry about.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.120]   And I think that's why so many people
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.960]   are worried and freaked out
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.320]   because they thought, well, wait,
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.560]   this isn't something I ever thought I had to worry about.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.680]   Little story here, Duncan.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.320]   Six years ago this May, my twins were born.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.720]   I have to admit the first three months or so
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.040]   were basically a blur,
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.120]   but I still vividly remember the day they were born.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.320]   We had it all scheduled in advance
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.360]   'cause my wife had a C-section
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.480]   'cause of course there's two tiny infants in her stomach.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.600]   So we're sitting in the hospital room beforehand
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.560]   and the anesthesiologist comes in.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.600]   We're waiting to go on the OR
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.680]   and he has to go through his little checklist.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.160]   I don't know if they have to tell you this or what,
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.800]   but here's your potential side effects
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.160]   from the anesthesia and the surgery, right?
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.480]   Headache, numbness, nausea, vomiting, whatever.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.480]   Itching, it's a bunch of other stuff that's way worse.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.600]   - I'm already passed out on the ground at this point.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.080]   - Well, he walks us through the probabilities.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.520]   Yeah, I'm not good in hospitals either.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.320]   One out of every 40,000 people this happens to,
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.560]   one out of every 5,000 people this happens to,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.920]   and he left us with a great line though.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.360]   He said, "Listen, I know there's a ton of stuff
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.960]   "to worry about that could go wrong today,
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.400]   "but the riskiest thing you ever did
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.720]   "was drive to the hospital."
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.920]   He's like, "You guys made it through that.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.720]   "You're far more likely to get in an accident
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080]   "and have something go wrong in a car
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.480]   "than in the hospital."
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.120]   I almost laughed because it reminded me
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.000]   of the Lloyd Christmas "Dumb and Dumber" line
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.400]   to Mary Swanson on the way to the airport.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.760]   You're, Mary, you're much more likely
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.760]   to get killed on the way to the airport.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.680]   And it kind of reframed the risk for us
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.080]   of worrying about the stuff that we were worried about,
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.040]   all the possible things that could go wrong.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.240]   I liked the Carl Richards quote he wrote once,
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.480]   "That risk is what's left over
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.000]   "after you've thought of everything."
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.440]   It kind of seems like that's what this week feels like.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.640]   There's the old saying, "We make plans and God laughs."
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.680]   I think it's the financial version of this
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.720]   is Wall Street strategists make an annual outlook
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.720]   and God laughs because people are writing
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.040]   the "What to Expect for 2023" reports.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.800]   No one had bank runs listed, right?
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.120]   Bank failures, bank runs, potential financial crisis
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.760]   in the finance sector.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.360]   And of course, regular people weren't planning
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.120]   on worrying about the amount of money in their bank account.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.760]   We had people, regular people email us in and say,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.760]   "Listen, I was supposed to get paid on Friday,
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.580]   "but my paycheck is administered through SVB Bank, right?
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.120]   "And I didn't get paid.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.620]   "I had to wait till Monday or Tuesday to get paid
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.200]   "until things got figured out."
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.520]   So based on the amount of questions
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.340]   that came pouring in this week,
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.720]   a lot of people are worried about the safety of their cash.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.000]   So we're gonna go through a bunch of those today.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.060]   So let's get into it.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.640]   - Okay, so first up today, we have a question from Sean.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.240]   Did VCs really cause the SVB bank run via Twitter?
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.280]   What impact does this have on trust in banks?
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.020]   And this, I threw this part in
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.460]   because this is what we were talking about.
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.300]   Is causing a bank run a criminal offense
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.960]   or is there any culpability here?
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.820]   - Okay, let's bring in some help right away on this.
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.620]   - Yeah, I really demand to be heard on this topic.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.460]   - Wait, I do have stuff to say on this.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.360]   Can we go back one topic though?
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.720]   I like that story that you told, Ben.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.280]   So the doctor was like, "Listen, as risky as this is,
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.880]   "it's nothing compared to driving on the highway."
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.520]   I think that's a really...
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.080]   You know, Barry does all those slides in his presentation
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.240]   about like, you're more likely to be bit and killed
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.080]   by a mosquito than a shark.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.240]   And like all the risks that are clear and present
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.000]   right in front of our face are not necessarily
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.200]   the risks most likely to put us away.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.160]   I think that's a really good, it's a really good analog.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.680]   The biggest risk I ever took
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.120]   was going to a Mexican hospital during spring break.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.480]   And I sprained my wrist
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.720]   and the doctor was wrapping up my wrist
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.840]   and he had a lit cigarette dangling from his mouth.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.640]   And then we went to the Mexican pharmacy
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.480]   for the pain pills.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.240]   And that was probably the second biggest risk I ever took
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.980]   'cause I didn't even like know what the prescription was.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.640]   I just started taking them
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.160]   and still being out on spring break drinking.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160]   And probably that was a bigger risk
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.280]   than driving on the highway in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.720]   So like that, you know, for me, like once I got through that
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.040]   I don't worry so much about all the risks these days.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.040]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.360]   - Cheap healthcare though for you.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.680]   Your healthcare bill is much cheaper than ours.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.340]   - I mean, I wouldn't have known the difference.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.240]   I was probably 18.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.680]   I don't even know who was paying for it
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.080]   or how it got paid for.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.420]   I just, you know, it's one of those things.
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.600]   All right, I'm really excited to be on the show today.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.240]   Did Twitter, people on Twitter cause the bank run?
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.080]   Yes.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.400]   - Kind of.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.960]   - Who could argue with that?
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.880]   Of course they did.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.720]   Who else did it?
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.540]   - Do we want to name names?
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.800]   Is there anyone particularly responsible?
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.860]   - Anyone that felt that it was necessary
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.240]   to not only tell their portfolio companies
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.960]   behind the scenes to remove capital,
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.680]   but then to broadcast that
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.800]   in some sort of reverse virtue signal.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.640]   Yeah, you did it.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.460]   It was you.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.300]   You were part of it.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.140]   - Do you think though that,
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.600]   so we've been talking about the blame game all week.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.560]   Do you think that there's anything that they can do
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.740]   to have safeguards in place?
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.120]   Or is this just the sort of psychological event
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.040]   that you can't plan for?
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.620]   Like they have circuit breakers in the stock market.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.880]   Do you think that would ever make sense in a bank?
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.560]   Or is that, does that kind of go against the whole idea
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.240]   of well, I need my money, it's mine.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.480]   Could anything like that ever slow this down?
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.240]   - I don't think it,
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.680]   I don't think that absent Twitter,
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.680]   there would not have been any issue
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.840]   because there were short sellers
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.160]   who had been looking at the balance sheet
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.080]   and the income statement of this company
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.160]   for like six quarters now
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.680]   and saying something's going on here.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.040]   Like deposits were already quietly leaving.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.080]   That's true.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.680]   Pre the blow up on Twitter.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.120]   That's so, that's one thing.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.680]   And the second thing is they were severely offsides
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.120]   in their bond portfolio.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.920]   You can't have $90 billion in treasuries
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.740]   and no interest rate hedges,
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.740]   especially if you have that homogenous of a depositor base.
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.520]   Like everyone in the depositor base lives in the same area
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.160]   and does the same thing for a living.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160]   Like you can't, so there were always issues.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160]   I'm not saying like Twitter is at fault
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.280]   for the bank having issues.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.160]   Twitter definitely accelerated the meme
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.440]   of pull your money out of Silicon Valley Bank.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.040]   - The trust thing going forward I think is interesting
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.280]   because I've been hearing this from a lot of people
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.280]   who never pay attention to the financial markets
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.540]   or the banking system.
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.680]   And I really can't tell if this is something
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.700]   people pay attention to for two weeks
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.640]   and then they move on to their lives
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.960]   and worry about the next thing.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.120]   Or if this is something that will actually seep
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.120]   into people's psyche and they will go,
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.800]   wait a minute, if I'm gonna have to think about this
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.000]   all the time, I'm gonna be more thoughtful
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.800]   about where I have my money.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.560]   - It's such a great question.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.920]   People learn, but they don't really learn.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.520]   Or they learn, but they don't really change.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.920]   In America, we have prioritized convenience
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.400]   over everything else, which is like,
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.880]   you think about like internet passwords.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.160]   People have the same password for every website.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.960]   'Cause it's not realistic that you're gonna come up
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.560]   with 80 different passwords for 80 different apps.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.820]   So it's just like, this is the system that we have.
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.660]   With banks, it's not gonna be much different.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.720]   Like as much as we all learned from Lehman,
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.720]   MF Global was three years later.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.860]   You can't really eliminate all risk
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.880]   from financial institutions.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.540]   You can't really have perfect trust in the financial system.
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.860]   It's not realistic to think that that's even possible.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.860]   And so community banks will always be slightly riskier
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.920]   than money centers, but money center banks are risky too.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.240]   And people will eventually default
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.360]   to whatever's the most convenient and easiest solution.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.460]   So I don't think the idea of local banking
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.980]   is gonna completely disappear.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.420]   In fact, the events of this week might make it
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.860]   so that there's almost no advantage
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.420]   for any bank in terms of safety.
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.880]   Like we just might have seen the,
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.060]   we might have witnessed FDIC insurance becoming unlimited.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.220]   >> Right, all right, Duncan, next question.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.100]   >> Okay, up next we have a question from Alex.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.920]   My wife and I have the bulk of our investments
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.940]   in two accounts.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.260]   Is this a dumb practice?
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.120]   Should we be more diversified with our institutions?
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.980]   We've been discussing this for a while and after SBB,
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.860]   it's brought the discussion back to the kitchen table.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.860]   I understand that the FDIC insures up to 250,000,
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.140]   but once you get north of that,
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.700]   are there any best practices for what to do?
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.180]   And the second part of this was from another listener.
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.940]   If a brokerage fails, what happens to customers' holdings?
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.820]   >> So before Ben jumps in, just real quick,
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.980]   brokerage and bank are two separate things.
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.180]   FDIC and SIPC are not the same thing.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.860]   So there's a very important distinction there.
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:29.040]   And then like what I would basically just say,
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.180]   very, very, very simply,
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.860]   again, based on the events of this week,
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.380]   I don't think FDIC insurance
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.040]   is really going to matter anymore.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.420]   Because if they were willing to bail out
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.940]   the people who had bank accounts at Signature
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.560]   and at Silicon Valley,
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.900]   how could they discriminate against the next bank
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.500]   that comes along, their depositors?
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.460]   So I almost think like it's de facto now a moot point.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.300]   If you have money in a bank and the bank screws up,
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.580]   you're probably okay.
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.460]   Last thing,
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.420]   it's not as though Silicon Valley's bank balances
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.820]   were going to be wiped out to zero.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.980]   This is more like,
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.440]   do they have to take a five or a 10% haircut?
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.900]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.900]   This is not a bank that had a gaping black hole of losses.
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.380]   They had a treasury bond portfolio
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.520]   that if held to maturity, would have been money good.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.260]   So this was never about like,
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.740]   oh my God, my savings were wiped out by a bank.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.460]   >> Yeah, this was about the bank of Sam Venkman Freed.
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.020]   >> No, and so I think there's a lot of misunderstanding
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.100]   about that in the public.
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.520]   They think like, oh, the bank was insolvent,
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.900]   meaning the deposits were going to be wiped out to zero.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.780]   None of that was ever on the table
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.500]   or was ever going to happen.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.020]   >> So we've gotten questions like this
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.580]   on the brokerage angle before in the past.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.780]   What if Vanguard or Charles Schwab
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.900]   or Fidelity or Robinhood go under?
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.580]   What happens to my securities?
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.380]   And people have actually asked us that in the past
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.540]   and we've got a lot of questions on it this week
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.140]   saying, you know, I'm scared here.
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.620]   And I think the people are conflating the two,
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.820]   to your point about brokerages versus banks.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.420]   It's not like a brokerage can take your money
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.340]   and that, or take your securities
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.380]   and lend them out on your behalf and speculate.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.180]   So that, it's kind of, they're the third party.
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.460]   >> Well, FTX did that.
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.700]   That's what FTX literally did.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.260]   >> If you're not in the bank of Bernie Madoff
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.300]   or Sam Venkman Freed.
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.140]   >> That's right.
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.580]   >> These are third party custodians.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.540]   The SEC has consumer protection rules in place.
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.940]   And I guess the way to think about it is
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.880]   if you own a stock or a bond or a mutual fund or an ETF,
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.580]   wherever you hold it, as long as it's not
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.060]   the bank of Madoff, those holdings are yours.
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:39.900]   And if something ever happened
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.220]   to the underlying financial firm,
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.740]   you still own those holdings.
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.780]   It's not like they can take them from you
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.180]   in a creditor or something if the bank went under
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.020]   or the financial firm went under.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.780]   >> So here's something interesting.
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.260]   I don't think this is as prevalent now,
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.300]   but back in the day, there was a difference
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.900]   between holding securities in your own name
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.140]   versus holding them in street name.
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.100]   And when you hold them in your own name,
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.940]   you are deliberately, so the brokerage firm
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.740]   typically defaults to your securities.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.820]   So let's say Ben has an account at a brokerage firm.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.260]   And in that account, he owns shares of Meta
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.180]   and Goldman Sachs and Amgen.
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.620]   Those are his three stocks.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.700]   The default is that the brokerage is holding
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.580]   those securities for Ben in street name,
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:34.580]   which means they basically have them sitting there
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.380]   in an account that short sellers could borrow
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.100]   those stock certificates to use them
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.660]   to sell it short, et cetera.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.860]   Now, if you want to be very specific,
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.740]   you could say, put those in my name, not in street name.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.780]   And you can literally instruct the brokerage firm
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.980]   as the custodian of your securities
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.300]   to move those into what they call the vault
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.620]   or move those into your own name or whatever.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.500]   So like, this is the kind of thing
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.020]   that's like a little bit confusing for people.
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.460]   But what Ben said is the main point.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.660]   They don't have the right to turn your securities
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.300]   into their securities.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.180]   They can't use your securities as part of like
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.980]   some bigger trade or speculation they're doing.
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.380]   However, on the bank side, it is that way.
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.340]   They can literally take your cash
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.420]   and invest your cash into contracts,
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.220]   into bonds, into stocks.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.900]   So that's a very different phenomenon.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.260]   And that's why the sell-off in Schwab
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.460]   made absolutely no sense to me.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.780]   Because yeah, Schwab has a bank,
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.020]   but that is a securities business.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.620]   And people's securities portfolios were not at risk.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.940]   - Yeah, and if all of a sudden people started showing up
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.500]   and their securities were gone for whatever,
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.940]   I mean, this is the kind of thing--
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.780]   - Jail.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.140]   - Right, yeah, that's not gonna happen.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.300]   - So Cliff beat me to this in the chat,
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.180]   but I was gonna ask,
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.260]   can you still get a paper certificate for stocks?
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.660]   Would that be safer?
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.620]   I just had a stack of them in my apartment.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.340]   - You can, you have to ask for it.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.540]   You have to request it.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.020]   - I think you also have to put a panic room
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.060]   in your house, though, to store them.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:13.900]   Otherwise--
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.100]   - I would just keep it with all my precious metals.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.220]   - You know what you get a paper stock certificate for?
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.860]   Instagram, like you want to--
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.660]   - They are cool, they're pretty cool.
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.700]   - You ever see like five years ago,
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.260]   Kanye West bought Kim Kardashian an anniversary present.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:34.340]   He bought her, she had physical stock certificates
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.700]   for Google, Disney, Apple, all these stocks,
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.660]   and she posted that to the 'Gram.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.780]   And that was kind of cool
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.540]   because I think it encouraged young people
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.820]   to want to invest.
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.860]   So I kind of feel like that's what you would do,
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.620]   something like that.
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.820]   When I was new in the business,
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.220]   we would buy client shares of Disney
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.820]   and then have the stock certificate sent to them.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.940]   And they would like give it to their son or daughter
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.900]   and like frame it in like a nursery or something.
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.660]   Other than that, there's no real purpose.
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.820]   - I think I mentioned last week, Duncan,
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.140]   I gave a talk to a high school recently.
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.620]   And as a thank you, they sent me like a share,
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.220]   one share of Disney in a little certificate.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.940]   So you actually, I can't remember the name of the company,
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:16.940]   you can do that.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.140]   - Yeah, I've seen that before.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.620]   Atari has really cool ones too.
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.900]   I've seen those, you can buy them on Etsy.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.340]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.860]   - But they're not, this is important,
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.740]   they're not like bearer bonds.
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:27.700]   - Right, it's not like diehard,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.860]   you can steal them from someone.
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.140]   - Right, like if Duncan has one share of Disney
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.940]   or Ben has one share of Disney,
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.940]   I can't take that and then go turn it in for the money.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.340]   That's not how it works.
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.940]   - So not really that useful.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.540]   - It's not like Heat, the movie Heat, right?
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.460]   Where like you could steal a tranche of stock certificates
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.300]   and then turn them in some way.
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.140]   - I'll abandon my movement
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.500]   to bring back paper stock certificates then.
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.980]   Okay, and part of that question
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.580]   was from Handle Crispy Delicious.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.180]   So I forgot to shut him out.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.820]   - Yeah, it was a Twitter question, I think.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.180]   - Okay, so up next we have a question from Matthew.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.860]   The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.860]   has a lot of exposure to SVB and other similar banks
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.820]   based on public SEC filings.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.260]   My money market fund has approximately 20% of its holdings
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.100]   in FHLB securities as of February 28th.
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.620]   Should I be concerned?
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.100]   I understand FHLB is a GSE.
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.180]   Y'all will have to explain that one.
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.320]   I don't know what that means.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.780]   Just like Fannie and Freddie,
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.220]   who I'm sure you remember from the GFC,
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.260]   Global Financial Crisis for people watching.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.460]   The second largest bank failure in U.S. history
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.580]   is enough of a low probability event for me.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.660]   Just want your thoughts on if I should be concerned
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.060]   with other low probability events
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.540]   like something non-crypto breaking the buck because of SVB.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.980]   - GSE is a government sponsored enterprise,
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:43.900]   something like that.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.780]   - Okay.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.780]   I was gonna say entity, is it enterprise?
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.180]   Yeah, it's one or the other.
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.020]   Okay.
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.780]   - The Wall Street Journal had a piece on this.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.540]   - Wait, Ben, is FHLB is,
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.820]   so when he says securities, he owns bonds.
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.740]   - Yes, I think he's saying that,
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.340]   so the Wall Street Journal had a piece on this
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:06.340]   and they said that FHLB basically
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.660]   underwrote some of those bonds, I think,
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.680]   and they said that they gave them like 13 billion in bonds,
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.700]   but they had to pledge 45 billion in collateral for that.
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.980]   So the Wall Street Journal piece,
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.900]   and the FHLB of San Francisco did put out a statement on it
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.740]   and they basically said,
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.180]   "We're a AAA rated financial institution.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.660]   "Don't worry about it."
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.020]   I think this is, it sounds like it's pretty insulated.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.540]   This just seems pretty far down the line
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.060]   in terms of worries that,
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.120]   and it never really got to the point, I think,
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.340]   where they've had to worry about this yet.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.100]   So I think reaching the money market,
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.740]   we got another question on money markets coming up,
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.340]   but this seems to me like another one
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.300]   of those systemic issues that,
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.740]   do you really think that the Fed
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.580]   would allow one of their regional banks
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.140]   to sort of be left holding the bag here?
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.980]   No, of course not.
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.820]   There's a debate to be had
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.580]   whether or not there should be a such thing as a GSE.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.000]   I think like in the '30s, '40s, '50s, '60s,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.420]   they were trying to encourage
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.580]   the suburbanization of America.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.460]   They were actively looking to move people
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.780]   out of apartment buildings
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.460]   and move them into the suburbs and buy homes
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.780]   and buy automobiles and have kids
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.980]   and have public schools built.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.380]   And in that environment
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.900]   where we were basically building something
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.740]   that didn't exist, you really needed Fannie, Freddie.
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.220]   Now they back the entire mortgage market.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.020]   There's not even an alternative to Fannie and Freddie.
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.320]   So I think these things are less risky,
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.580]   if that makes sense to you,
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:35.340]   rather than more risky in a crisis especially.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.180]   This is the type of paper that people are clamoring for
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:44.180]   to own in what feels like a private market crisis.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.660]   The government is not gonna let their own agencies go under.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.540]   No.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.740]   By the way, fun fact,
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:54.340]   do you know why the government was so intent in the 1950s
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:58.620]   on moving people out into the suburbs from the cities?
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.500]   McDonald's?
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.960]   I don't know. No, communism.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.000]   This is true.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.860]   There was this red scare
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.900]   and the politicians were terrified
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.100]   that we were gonna get these communist uprisings
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.600]   like they had all over Europe.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.120]   Europe basically didn't have suburbs.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.020]   They had farms and cities.
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.700]   So the idea was if people own property,
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.300]   they're less likely to become communists.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.920]   This is a true story.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.660]   No one's driving to a protest.
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:27.980]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:28.820]   Literally.
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.340]   If you rent in an apartment building,
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.540]   you're more likely to be persuaded,
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.900]   but not modern,
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.460]   to be persuaded by these socialist uprisings
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.420]   versus if you own land, right?
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.900]   You own a car, own a dishwasher.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.140]   You're not running off to join a communist mob.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.620]   I'm putting the pieces together here
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.140]   about why everyone says that Millennials and Gen Z
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.140]   are communists because the last time they built--
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.500]   'Cause they live in the city.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.140]   No, the last time they built a bunch of homes
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.020]   was the 1950s.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.420]   So maybe the Millennials are trying to get the government
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.420]   to build more affordable housing.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.380]   If you want to keep the status, right,
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.340]   if the boomers want to keep the status quo
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.780]   for the next 20 years until they're all gone,
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.580]   the smartest thing to do is help turn the Millennials
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.060]   into homeowners as quickly as possible.
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:20.060]   Otherwise, full-blown AOC-style collective farms.
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.980]   We're gonna revolt.
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.540]   Yeah, Duncan's gonna be leading the charge.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.640]   This isn't live, right?
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.900]   We could edit this?
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.860]   Yeah, we'll edit this after.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.020]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.700]   Okay, up next, we have a question from Travis.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.680]   I'm considering keeping our emergency fund
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.300]   in a money market fund.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.500]   Is this too risky without it having FDIC insurance?
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.060]   I hope you guys can help me understand this
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.740]   because I still don't understand the point
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.600]   of a money market fund, really, what purpose it serves.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.060]   So this is another one there.
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.940]   I feel like a lot of these questions come down to
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.860]   we have the rules and regulations in place
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.460]   that are written down on the books,
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.980]   and then we have the unspoken ones
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.940]   that you have to kind of use common sense for,
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.180]   and we can't make any guarantees or promises.
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.020]   But with stuff like this,
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.460]   if you think about the Prime Fund broke the buck in 2008
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.860]   'cause Lehman failed,
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.100]   and that caused a run on money markets.
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.420]   They have done, they have put new rules
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.380]   and regulations in place.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.360]   They actually did.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.300]   There's some sort of, they try to keep the NAV,
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.020]   but some of them can float now.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.780]   But also, they allow some of these monies
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:20.740]   to put gates on 'em, right?
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.220]   I think 2016, they put some new regulations in place
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.860]   that would allow these funds to be gated
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.020]   if there was a run.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.220]   So they did change the rules on these a little bit.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.780]   - We should talk about why the money market fund,
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.420]   the Prime Fund, which was one of the most prominent,
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:43.060]   most widely used money market funds broke the buck.
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.380]   And there was like a good reason.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.260]   They were jammed with commercial paper.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.020]   And commercial paper is like seven day debt.
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.360]   The way to think about it is like the grease
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.740]   that allows commerce to take place.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.600]   It's like how money moves around very quickly
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.440]   between corporations.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.140]   - These repo things and yeah.
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.220]   - Yeah, it's not right.
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.660]   It's not like a long-term bond.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:05.980]   It's like, look, for seven days,
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.100]   I need you to float this much capital.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.620]   And so there's a trading market for this kind of paper.
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.700]   And the commercial debt market froze up.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.460]   One of the major warning signs
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.020]   that the Fed should have been paying more attention to
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.500]   in '06 and '07 and wasn't.
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.460]   Well, you better believe they pay a ton of attention
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.180]   to the overnight repo markets,
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:30.300]   the seven day funding markets, commercial paper.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.620]   So again, this is like the,
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.220]   it's less likely we'll be a victim
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.040]   of whatever the problem was from the last war.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.640]   And all generals fight the last war.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.580]   So I wouldn't worry tremendously about money market funds.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.900]   But yeah, anything that you're doing
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.900]   to get a quote, better rate of return than somebody else,
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.820]   or then what is standard,
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:56.260]   obviously is gonna carry a little bit more risk.
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.660]   So you always wanna say like,
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.600]   what is the risk worth taking?
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.980]   If it's for two extra basis points,
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.220]   probably not worth the risk.
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.800]   If it's for 20 extra basis points,
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.500]   I don't know how much money is at stake.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.540]   There's a conversation to be had there.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.700]   - I looked this up and the Investment Company Institute
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.580]   says there's $5 trillion in these funds.
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.560]   It's a lot of money.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.040]   They broke them up into like government
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.140]   and institutional and retail,
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.220]   and like 2 trillion is in retail.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.580]   I mean, excuse me, there's a ton of options.
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.300]   You have online savings accounts.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.340]   You can put your money in T-bills.
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.460]   I mean, if you want the safest savings account,
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.140]   there is a T-bill is pretty close.
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.220]   Maybe not as liquid as like an overnight savings account.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.740]   IBON, CDs, there's all these things you can put it in.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.860]   The good news is,
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.180]   I hate to like denigrate anyone
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.020]   who's worried about this stuff,
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.940]   but it almost feels like people who make $50,000 a year
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.820]   worried about billionaires getting taxed too much, right?
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:47.000]   Because how many of us actually have 250K sitting in cash?
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:47.840]   Not many.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.100]   I know it's businesses do.
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.540]   That's the good thing you have to think about.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.060]   Obviously, you don't wanna keep all your money
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.620]   just sitting in a checking account,
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.300]   but there are so many different ways,
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.600]   easy ways that you can manage your cash these days.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.780]   The good news is,
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.900]   outside of the actual rules and regulations,
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.060]   it's pretty easy for people to keep their cash safe
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.700]   if that's really a huge worry.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:06.820]   - Can I say one other thing,
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.820]   just as like a capper to this whole conversation?
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:15.060]   I totally understand why people are worried about this stuff
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.340]   because it's a nightmare scenario.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.960]   You trade years of your time, maybe decades of your time,
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.000]   try to save money.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.820]   It's so hard to do with the cost of everything,
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:28.040]   especially you have kids, you have real estate.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.540]   It's so hard to save money.
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.100]   You manage to, and then there's like this nightmare
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.700]   that like some force beyond your control
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.220]   can take it all away.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.420]   I want people to understand that
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.620]   that doesn't actually happen.
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:43.100]   Like the history of the modern history of the United States
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.060]   is not one in which people wake up one day
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.260]   and some asshole banker ruined their lives.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.620]   We just don't have this as part of our system.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.420]   So yeah, of course, it's understandable
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.060]   why people should worry,
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.660]   but don't fixate on this to the point where
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.140]   like you need Xanax so you can't sleep at night.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.300]   It's not actually gonna happen to you.
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.340]   - Yeah, the weird thing is that faith and trust
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.220]   are so much a bigger part of this whole financial system
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.160]   that if the regulators and the government
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.720]   ever allowed that faith to be truly broken
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.560]   by people having their assets--
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.380]   - It's a civil war.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.220]   - Seized somehow.
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.300]   Yeah, the whole system would cease to work.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.560]   It would all seize up and it wouldn't,
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.780]   it really wouldn't work anymore.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:27.980]   - Yeah, I think people should understand like,
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.220]   imagine that happened to you and not your neighbor
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.980]   because you banked at two different banks.
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.680]   What the hell is that?
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.060]   - Right, how fair to them, yeah.
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.640]   - Come on, that's not,
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.540]   Matt Levine made a really good point.
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.700]   Somebody was saying, maybe Cliff was talking about
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.620]   like the more, I'm not on Twitter, I don't even know.
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.900]   Somebody was saying the moral hazard like
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.460]   of bailing out the depositors at one bank,
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.380]   you're sending the wrong message that,
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.100]   you know what, banks are one of these things
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.300]   that are just supposed to work.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.220]   It's not like an investment in a mutual fund.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.380]   You're not supposed to have to read the fine print
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.960]   in a federally chartered or a state chartered bank.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.600]   It's just supposed to work.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.580]   And by work, I don't mean you get the highest rate.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.860]   I mean, your fucking money is there
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.980]   when you need your money.
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.580]   Like that's how it's supposed to work.
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.620]   So I don't think there's any moral hazard
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.420]   in making sure that that works.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.440]   I just, I don't see it in this case.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.260]   - There've been quite a few comments
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.340]   on our videos recently about Silicon Valley Bank
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.460]   of people kind of indicating that
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.180]   this was a bailout for the rich
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.980]   and that this is gonna somehow hurt the average person.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.620]   Is there any truth to that?
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.460]   Or is that just a misunderstanding?
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.000]   - The first part is true, the second part is not.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.140]   - Okay. - Right.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.040]   - And that's because this is not tax-backed.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.380]   - People probably have more protection now
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.140]   than they did before this happened.
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.580]   I think, so-
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.220]   - This is why we have to stop playing this class,
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.900]   this classism, this game.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.100]   It doesn't, in the end, it doesn't work for,
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.020]   yes, it's true that most of the signatories
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.520]   for the bank accounts at Silicon Valley Bank
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.840]   are on the wealthier end of the spectrum, of course.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.980]   If you have millions of dollars in a bank
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.400]   for your corporation,
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.980]   and you are the head of the corporation,
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.300]   obviously you are, quote-unquote, the rich.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.980]   However, if that deposit is lost,
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.280]   you're probably closing your corporation,
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.460]   you're probably retaining some money,
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.480]   the people you're firing get nothing out of the deal.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.860]   So we really have to stop playing this game.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.980]   It really doesn't, it doesn't work for anyone
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.740]   if we start blowing up bank accounts.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.780]   - Right, like I said- - Peeling it at the story.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.060]   - We heard from a few people who said,
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.860]   I did not get my paycheck on Friday.
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.140]   I was supposed to get paid,
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.080]   and I was supposed to run through SVB,
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.620]   and I had to worry all weekend about getting my paycheck,
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.180]   and this isn't some executive at a bank.
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.980]   This is a regular person who just needed their money,
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.380]   and was sweating out all weekend getting their paycheck.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.420]   - Seth in the chat says,
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.200]   why would a deposit make interest if there's no risk?
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.060]   Is that a fair point?
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:27:59.900]   What would you say to that?
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.660]   - Well, I mean, how many checking accounts
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.100]   actually pay interest, right?
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.900]   - They barely do.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.220]   - And so the things that you do get paid for,
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.300]   and yeah, T-bills are taking a risk,
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.100]   'cause that's interest rate risk or inflation risk.
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.580]   So yeah, anything, anything that you put your money into
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.500]   is taking a little risk,
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.660]   but putting your money in a checking account
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.360]   is you're not actually taking any risk there, right?
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.560]   You're not expecting to earn any reward at least.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.400]   - Right.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.220]   - All right, I think we got one more.
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.780]   - Okay, last but not least, we have a question from Tim.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.700]   This banking crisis has to make it more likely
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.260]   that we see a recession, right?
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.220]   - My initial read on this whole thing was that-
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.220]   - Wait, say it again.
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.400]   Say it one more, you guys flashed that too fast for me.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.220]   I don't process at that speed.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.540]   The banking crisis has to make it more likely.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.980]   Yes, more likely, definitely.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.300]   Ben, do you agree?
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.940]   - Yeah, no, I think that any time you,
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.540]   if credit is gonna contract in any way,
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.720]   or if people just, their lack of trust in risk-taking
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.380]   goes down, that's deflationary to me.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.120]   And I think that has to-
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.340]   Yeah, recession is much higher likelihood
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.460]   than it was 10 days ago, I think.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.860]   - Yeah, it doesn't mean it seals our fate,
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.380]   but it's a disinflationary shock.
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.940]   It 100% changes people's sentiment,
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.300]   probably changes some people's behavior.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.280]   It's like a wake-up call for people
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.060]   that haven't worried about this ever in their life.
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:24.100]   All of a sudden, it makes it more likely.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.080]   Statistically, I don't think either of us
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.580]   really have a strong view.
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.980]   Is it 5% more likely, 50?
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:30.820]   I don't know.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.340]   - I went from 38 to 40.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.180]   - More.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.740]   - Why is the stock market up today, Ben, though?
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.500]   If people think the recession's more likely than-
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.580]   - The stock market priced in a recession last year.
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:40.700]   I don't know if you've been-
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.340]   I don't know if anybody remembers 2022 anymore.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:44.300]   - I mean, my portfolio didn't,
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.060]   but I know for a lot of people it did.
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.100]   - The last three years is the perfect example
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.780]   of why the stock market is not the economy.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.980]   It's completely backwards some ways.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.220]   Sometimes it goes with it, sometimes it goes against it.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:58.180]   The stock market thinks it's like eight steps
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.220]   ahead of the economy.
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.980]   Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.260]   I don't think you can use the stock market
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.740]   as a barometer of, are we going into a recession or not?
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.300]   'Cause to Josh's point, what if we already priced it in
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.780]   and it's just waiting for it to happen?
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.500]   If we see a recession, the stock market's gonna take off.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.900]   I mean, that's the kind of thing
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.140]   where you can't use the stock market as a signal.
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.740]   - Listen, I wish there were a way
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.940]   I could just invest directly into GDP.
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.880]   Then all these experts on the economy
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.820]   would have like a vehicle they can,
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.500]   like, maybe Calshi does that, I don't know.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.640]   Like, can I just buy a share of GDP
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.900]   and stop worrying whether or not
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.940]   the stock market is pricing it in or not?
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.460]   - We should put together a pitch deck.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.240]   That sounds like a company.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.820]   - Yeah, we'll get Silicon Valley Bank to back us.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.140]   - Oh, God.
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.460]   But I mean, this is also a great reminder
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.020]   that 14 days ago, we were worried
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.300]   that the economy was too strong and inflation was too hot.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.580]   And then this thing, just the Molotov cocktail
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.260]   gets thrown in through the window
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.500]   and all of a sudden we're worried about disinflation
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.540]   and a financial crisis and potential deflation.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.300]   And those competing ideas, I think,
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.060]   this is one of those things where I don't know
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.660]   which one is gonna win out here.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.100]   - This guy on one of my shows last week
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.900]   was like, "This is the Fed getting what it wants."
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.860]   No.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:10.700]   - Yeah, they did not-
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.580]   - I don't think so.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.940]   - No, they did not want a-
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.500]   - I don't think so, sir.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.900]   - Yes, they don't want trust in the financial system
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.480]   to all of a sudden go,
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.480]   that's not how they want inflation to come down.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.420]   Right, they were hoping higher interest rates
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.760]   would make some CEOs fire a few people.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.020]   They were not hoping that, like,
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.700]   they'd be dealing with bank failures
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.300]   and being brought in front of Congress
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.420]   to explain why they didn't see this coming.
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.980]   - Right, exactly.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.100]   I don't think so.
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.500]   Hey, this has been so much fun.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.340]   Thank you guys for letting me join in today.
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.540]   I'm a big fan. - We appreciate it.

[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.980]   so you gave this show a lot of respectability today.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.340]   - This is serious business.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.500]   - It's true.
