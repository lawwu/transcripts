[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.060]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.080]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.680]   Today, we're discussing growth mindset.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.560]   Growth mindset is one of the most interesting
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.560]   and powerful concepts in all of psychology.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.880]   Growth mindset is essentially a way of embracing challenge
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.520]   and thinking about your bodily
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.680]   and brain's response to challenge
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.640]   in a way that allows you to optimize your performance.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.600]   Growth mindset consists of many things,
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.160]   which we will discuss today.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.160]   And of course, we will discuss
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.240]   how to implement growth mindset.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.000]   But some of the key features of growth mindset
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.460]   are developing an ability to distance your identity
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.000]   from the challenge you happen to be embracing.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.720]   Now, that might come as a bit of a surprise to many of you.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.000]   For instance, we grow up hearing, we hope from time to time,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.360]   that we are smart, that we are talented,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.400]   that we are a good athlete, that we are a good artist.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.480]   We like to think that we are good at something
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.780]   or perhaps many things,
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.100]   but it turns out that the kind of praise or feedback
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.180]   that we receive that attaches our identity to performance
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.560]   can actually undermine our performance.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.440]   And believe it or not, this is especially problematic
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.720]   for people that perform well in their endeavors.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.560]   That's right.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.480]   If you are somebody who performs well in school
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.920]   or athletics or music,
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.180]   and you are told that you are very smart,
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.580]   that you're an excellent student,
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.980]   that you're an excellent athlete,
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.040]   or that you're an excellent musician,
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.740]   you have much to lose if you at any moment
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.360]   do not perform well.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.040]   And that's because your identity has been integrated
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.600]   with your performance.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.600]   Somewhat counterintuitively, growth mindset is the process
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.180]   of distancing your identity from performance
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.140]   and rather attaching your identity and your efforts
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.900]   and your sense of motivation to effort itself
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.040]   and to the process of enjoying learning
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.600]   and getting better at learning anything.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.760]   So today we are going to discuss what growth mindset is
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.920]   and what it isn't because it's often discussed in terms
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.700]   that frankly are not accurate to the science.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.000]   We will also talk about another mindset,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.520]   which is the stress is enhancing mindset
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.780]   that it turns out can act synergistically
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.920]   with growth mindset such that when you combine
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.360]   growth mindset with the stress is enhancing mindset,
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.800]   you and anyone, it's been shown,
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.620]   can vastly improve your performance
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.200]   in essentially anything.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.660]   So today's discussion will of course explore
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.480]   the classic work of Carol Dweck,
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.420]   who was really the founder of the growth mindset field,
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.780]   as well as some of the newer research
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.600]   from people like David Yeager, Ali Krum and others,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.480]   who have explored how growth mindset
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.720]   and stress is enhancing mindsets can be applied
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.760]   both in and out of the classroom in children and adults,
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.080]   and really in people of all backgrounds.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.280]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.840]   you will have a rich understanding of the science
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.120]   as well as many tools that you can apply in everyday life
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.300]   in essentially any endeavor.
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.040]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.720]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.760]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.320]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.940]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.100]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.800]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.980]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.660]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.380]   with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.220]   And there's absolutely no question
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.300]   that sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.800]   physical health and performance.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.180]   When we're sleeping well and we're sleeping long enough,
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.480]   everything in our daily life goes that much better.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.140]   Now, a key component to getting a great night's sleep
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.520]   is the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.600]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.520]   your core body temperature actually has to drop
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.320]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.500]   Conversely, in order to wake up feeling refreshed,
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.440]   your core body temperature has to increase
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.220]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.740]   With Eight Sleep mattress covers,
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.760]   you can cool or heat your mattress
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.900]   at the beginning, middle and end of your night
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.740]   in order to optimize your night's sleep.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.640]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.700]   about two years ago,
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.820]   and it has dramatically improved the sleep
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.180]   that I get each and every night.
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.480]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.180]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.700]   and save up to $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.660]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.780]   select countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.100]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.740]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.640]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.740]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.540]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.380]   of the visual system,
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.480]   and I can tell you that your visual system
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.980]   has to contend with an enormous number
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.680]   of different challenges in order for you
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.240]   to be able to see clearly.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.980]   Roca understands all of those challenges
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.940]   at the level of the eye and the visual system
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.780]   within the brain,
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.900]   and they've designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.840]   so that no matter what environment you're in,
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.900]   you can always see with crystal clarity.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.280]   Originally, their glasses were designed for sports,
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.160]   and as a consequence,
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.740]   all of their glasses are extremely lightweight,
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.720]   and as well, they won't slip off your face
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.380]   even if you get sweaty.
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.520]   However, despite being designed initially for performance,
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.020]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.700]   include a lot of different styles
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.740]   that are designed for you to wear to work or out to dinner,
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.840]   as well as what I call the cyborg style
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.780]   that are designed for cycling, et cetera.
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.320]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.700]   go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A, .com,
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.900]   and enter the code Huberman
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.020]   to save 20% off your first order.
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.420]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A, .com,
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.780]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.820]   Let's talk about growth mindset.
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.280]   Growth mindset, as the name suggests,
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.040]   is the idea that we can get better at things,
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.820]   that is that our abilities are not fixed,
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.940]   but rather that our abilities are malleable.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.100]   And at the core of growth mindset
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.220]   is the idea that our brains can change,
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.920]   and indeed, they can.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.920]   We refer to that ability as neuroplasticity,
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.180]   or the nervous system's ability to change
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.100]   in response to experience.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.140]   Now, I've done several episodes about neuroplasticity,
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.060]   so that's a topic unto itself,
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.340]   but suffice to say that neuroplasticity, brain change,
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.100]   can occur throughout the entire lifespan.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.960]   It is far more robust early in life,
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.540]   from birth until about age 25.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.260]   Neuroplasticity is sort of the default process.
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.380]   Our brain is being shaped by our everyday experiences.
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.420]   But certainly from age 25 and onward,
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.880]   and certainly well into people's 90s even, it's been shown,
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.620]   the brain can change if we want it to.
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.060]   It can change for the worse, of course,
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.920]   through injury or disease, things of that sort,
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.000]   but it also can change for the better
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.860]   through deliberate focused bouts of learning.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.820]   We can learn new languages, we can learn art,
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.220]   we can learn music, we can get smarter,
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.440]   we can get better at essentially anything
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.720]   if we devote our attentional resources
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.240]   to learning those things.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.860]   So really any discussion about growth mindset
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.140]   has, as a subtext, a discussion about neuroplasticity.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.140]   Although today, we aren't going to focus so much
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.620]   on neuroplasticity, meaning we aren't going to focus
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.580]   so much on the neural circuit and neurochemical changes
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.940]   that underlie neuroplasticity,
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.940]   because I've covered those on previous episodes.
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.900]   We'll talk about them a little bit today.
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.300]   But we are mainly going to talk about the data,
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.900]   the studies from the field of psychology,
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.060]   applying growth mindset in and out of the classroom
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.760]   in children and adults.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.540]   And we are going to talk about tools,
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.460]   everyday tools that you can use
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.840]   to enhance growth mindset for yourself,
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.120]   and perhaps for those around you,
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.260]   if you care to teach growth mindset,
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.180]   which is you'll learn later,
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.380]   turns out to be an excellent way to reinforce
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.380]   your own growth mindset.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.700]   And we're going to talk about how to apply those tools
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.060]   in a bunch of different domains,
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.100]   musical, athletic, intellectual, and on and on.
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.780]   No discussion of growth mindset would be complete
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.940]   without mentioning that growth mindset
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.020]   is the brainchild of my colleague, Carol Dweck
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.100]   in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.360]   Today, you'll learn how she discovered growth mindset,
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.940]   and you will learn how others have taken that discovery
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.140]   and expanded upon it,
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.800]   and especially its application in and out of the classroom.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.580]   To start off our discussion about growth mindset, however,
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.460]   we need to define what a mindset is.
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.900]   I think most of us think we know what a mindset is.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.880]   We think, oh, it's kind of a mental stance
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.040]   where we are positive, or we are negative,
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.100]   or we believe something, or we don't believe something.
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.140]   But a mindset actually has a very specific definition.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.440]   And here I'm referring to the definition
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.900]   provided by Dr. Ali Krum.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.660]   Ali Krum is also a professor of psychology at Stanford.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.820]   She runs her own laboratory
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.540]   working on stress-related mindsets and other mindsets.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.220]   She's actually been a guest on this podcast previously.
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.900]   Highly recommend you listen to that episode
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.160]   if you haven't already.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.200]   Dr. Krum defines a mindset as quote,
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.140]   "A mental frame or lens that selectively organizes
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.280]   and encodes information."
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.420]   And I think the key thing to highlight there
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.140]   is organizes information.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.520]   Because as you all well know,
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.380]   we are constantly being bombarded with information
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.300]   from the outside world.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.300]   Sensory information about what's going on
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.940]   with our visual system, what we're hearing,
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.140]   what we're seeing, what we're feeling.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.400]   We are also bombarded with internal sensations
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.600]   of how full or empty our gut feels.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.440]   Are we hungry?
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.260]   Are we tired?
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.100]   Are we anxious?
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:58.940]   Are we calm, et cetera?
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.900]   So tons and tons of information funneling into our brain.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.640]   And mindsets really help us organize that information
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.700]   such that we pay attention to certain things and not others,
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.900]   and we respond to certain things and not others, okay?
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.900]   So here I'm not trying to put additional language
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.320]   on something simple in order to make it complex.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.420]   I'm trying to put a little bit of language.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.420]   That is that a mindset does many things,
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.980]   but it mainly organizes information.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.080]   I'll add to that for specific actions or inactions
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.040]   in a way that allows us to simplify our world,
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.580]   in a way that allows us to make certain choices
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.940]   and do away with thinking about
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.800]   and acting on other types of information.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.060]   The other thing about mindsets
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.220]   is that they include entire narratives.
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.540]   And most of the time, we aren't even aware
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.940]   of how those narratives are operating,
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.760]   meaning we don't walk around
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.700]   looking at opportunities in the world,
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.320]   like the opportunity to get better at fitness or a sport
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.940]   or music or arithmetic or languages
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.140]   or anything for that matter, thinking,
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.100]   "Okay, what is my mental frame or lens
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.860]   "that selectively organizes and encodes information?"
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.820]   We don't do that.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.300]   Instead, what we have are stories.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.940]   And those stories are usually attached
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.020]   to our sense of identity.
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.200]   Like, I'll just use myself, for instance,
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.040]   I do not think of myself as a good musician.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.420]   In fact, I can't read music.
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.540]   I'm terrible at playing instruments.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.080]   I like listening to music,
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.200]   but I consider myself a terrible musician, right?
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.920]   I've really assigned a value
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.420]   or I've assigned my value to music
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.340]   and my relationship to music, right?
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.700]   We tend to do that.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.780]   We can also do it in the opposite direction, right?
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.400]   I've been running a laboratory for a long time,
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.020]   been in science for close to three decades.
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.080]   So if you ask me, "Do I feel proficient at science?"
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.400]   I'd say, "Yeah, I'm proficient at science.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.680]   "I know how to do experiments, set up experiments,
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.940]   "write research papers, write grants, et cetera."
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.040]   I'm pretty good at it, right?
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.520]   We tend to decide if we are good or bad at things
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.800]   and we tend to integrate those with our identity somewhat
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.180]   or a lot, depending on whether or not
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.580]   we're a professional or amateur,
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.060]   how much we engage in an activity.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.940]   The point being that mindsets include all of these narratives
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.140]   and often those narratives are visible to us
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.340]   if we think about them,
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.100]   but most of the time we are moving through the world,
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.180]   meaning school, work, relationships, and all our endeavors,
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.780]   without a lot of careful thought
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.520]   about the narratives we carry.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.300]   And the beauty of growth mindset
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.420]   is that it forces us to step back
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.500]   and ask ourselves some simple questions.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.380]   These are questions that you could ask yourself right now.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.420]   And in fact, I highly recommend you do.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.160]   You could ask yourself, for instance,
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.040]   what have I been told I'm really good at?
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.160]   You should also ask yourself,
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.060]   what have I been told I'm really poor at,
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.300]   that I'm just not good at?
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.980]   What have I told myself I'm really good at?
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.540]   And what have I told myself I'm really bad at?
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.580]   And then a second set of questions is,
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.980]   what am I good at and why?
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.420]   Did it come naturally to me?
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.900]   Did I apply myself for many years?
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.020]   Meaning, did I apply a lot of effort to learning that thing?
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.280]   Or perhaps both, right?
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.620]   And then it's also important to ask yourself,
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.180]   why am I not good at other things?
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.420]   Is it simply because you've never applied yourself
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.460]   with those things?
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.620]   Or is it because you tried and had an early failure?
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.540]   Or perhaps you tried and tried and tried for many years
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.160]   and you continue to fail at that thing,
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.420]   or you just didn't reach a level of proficiency
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.020]   that made you want to pursue it further.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.160]   In asking yourself those questions,
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.300]   you are asking yourself not just what you're good at
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.700]   and bad at and why,
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.460]   you should also be thinking about
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.760]   where the messages of being good at something
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.600]   or being bad at something arrived from.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.740]   Did they arrive from outside you?
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.540]   Meaning from your parents, from your coaches,
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.660]   from your teachers?
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.360]   Or was it the case that despite a lot of positive feedback,
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.760]   you just sort of decided you weren't good at something?
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.900]   Or conversely, was it the case
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.580]   that despite a lot of negative feedback
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.860]   that you would never be good at something
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.860]   or that you weren't good at something
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.480]   that you continue to persist?
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.080]   Because there are certainly people like that.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.500]   The more negative feedback they get,
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.320]   the more they dig their heels in to prove themselves
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.540]   as capable of becoming good at something.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.460]   So I do recommend as we march forward in this conversation,
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.520]   you think about those questions.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.360]   What am I good at?
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.180]   What am I bad at?
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.720]   Why am I good at those things?
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.180]   Why am I bad at those things?
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.180]   And ask yourself to what extent your labels,
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.100]   that is your identity,
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.320]   is attached to the things that you are good at or bad at.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.180]   And the reason I'd like you to ask yourself those questions
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.400]   is that next we're going to talk about some research
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.540]   from Dr. Carol Dweck's laboratory
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.300]   that was really the seed of the entire field
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.780]   of growth mindset.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.620]   It relates to a specific set of experiments
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.280]   that really show that the specific feedback we get,
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.080]   meaning whether or not we get feedback
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.800]   that is attached to our identity,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.560]   like a label like smart or great athlete or talented,
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.360]   sends us down a very different path of performance
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.320]   in the short and long run
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.600]   as compared to whether or not we receive feedback
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.540]   that's based on effort,
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.400]   meaning you tried really hard
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.380]   or you really seem to apply yourself under conditions
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.480]   where you're getting the right answer over time
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.900]   because you simply refuse to quit.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.400]   Those are two very divergent sets of feedback.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.960]   And as you'll learn in a moment,
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.960]   the sorts of feedback that we get,
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.200]   especially early in life or early in an endeavor,
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.320]   so this doesn't just apply to young kids,
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.460]   this applies to adults too,
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.860]   who are taking on a new skill
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.040]   or are trying to expand on an existing skill,
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.920]   those two divergent forms of feedback
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.940]   get integrated into our core beliefs
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.720]   about what we think is possible for us in a given endeavor.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.820]   And the great news is,
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.900]   we can also modify those core beliefs
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.260]   simply by changing the feedback that we give ourselves.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.760]   The research paper I'd like to discuss briefly
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.660]   that beautifully embodies the runway
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.600]   that led to the discovery of growth mindset
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.860]   is a paper from Dr. Carol Dweck,
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.260]   as well as her colleague, Claudia Mueller.
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.360]   And the title of the paper essentially says it all.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.280]   The title is, "Praise for Intelligence Can Undermine
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.580]   Children's Motivation and Performance," right?
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.040]   That should be surprising,
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.500]   that praise for intelligence
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.020]   can undermine motivation and performance.
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:01.860]   I would have thought,
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.680]   and I think many people probably believe,
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.360]   that if you tell a child or an adult
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.740]   that they're really good at something
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.780]   and you're genuine about that feedback,
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.920]   meaning they're performing well,
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.440]   and you say, "Great, you're doing really well.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.840]   You're so smart, you're so talented,"
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.980]   that their performance would continue to improve,
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.420]   that it would bolster their motivation
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.020]   to engage in that activity, which hopefully they enjoy,
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.780]   but regardless, provided that it's a safe activity,
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.060]   it's educational, or what have you,
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.020]   that it would serve to encourage them, right?
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.220]   The kid thinks, "Not only am I engaging in this activity,
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.600]   but I'm getting positive feedback,
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.160]   presumably from people that I care about
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.160]   or whose opinion I care about.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.140]   Wouldn't that serve to elevate performance?"
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:41.980]   It does not.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.700]   In fact, the exact opposite happens.
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.220]   So I'll just give you a few of the key takeaways
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.120]   from this study.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.520]   The way it was done is very interesting.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.780]   They essentially gave feedback about performance
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.720]   that was linked up with a child's intelligence,
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.840]   telling kid they're smart, they're talented,
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.800]   that they can learn things really easily,
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.860]   or that they're very good at learning, this sort of thing,
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.340]   and they called that intelligence feedback.
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.280]   Or they gave them what was called effort feedback.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.960]   The simple way to think about effort feedback
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.700]   is that it's more attached to verbs as opposed to labels.
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.260]   So effort feedback consists of things
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.300]   like you tried really hard on that problem.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.600]   It was great the way that you applied effort.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.320]   It was great the way that you persisted.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.080]   It was great the way that even when you got the wrong answer
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.820]   you spent 10 minutes thinking about it
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.720]   and then you try it again and again,
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.380]   or in some cases, even if they didn't get the right answer,
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.080]   telling them, "Well, even though you didn't get
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.460]   the right answer, it's really terrific
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.760]   that you continue to try."
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.860]   Okay, so intelligence feedback was the sort of feedback
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.720]   that was tied to labels of identity,
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.920]   things like smart, talented, et cetera,
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.720]   whereas effort feedback was tied to verbs,
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.160]   choices, behavioral and cognitive choices
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.300]   that children made in an effort to learn
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.520]   or get better at something.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.220]   So in this study, which included over 100 children,
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.380]   they either got the intelligence type feedback
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.560]   or the effort type feedback,
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.520]   or there was a control group
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.360]   that didn't get either the intelligence
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.200]   or the effort type feedback.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.860]   And then they looked at a number of different outcomes.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:16.480]   So I'll just highlight a few examples of what they found.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.480]   First of all, the kids that got
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.580]   the intelligence-based feedback,
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.380]   when they were then later offered problem sets
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:26.020]   that were either challenging or were of the sort
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.960]   that they knew they could perform well on,
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.580]   they tended to select problems
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.400]   that they knew they could perform well on.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.920]   These were what were referred to as performance goals.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.700]   In other words, they picked problems
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.200]   that allowed them to continue to get the praise
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.880]   that they had received previously about being smart
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.120]   or talented.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.160]   Whereas the kids that got feedback
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.420]   about their strong effort,
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.240]   when later presented with problems
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.040]   that were either easy or hard,
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.480]   more often than not, they picked the harder problems
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.500]   that stood to teach them more.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.440]   So that's striking.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.800]   It says that if you tell a kid
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.080]   that they're smart or talented,
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.680]   and that's the reason why they perform well,
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.120]   when they encounter challenges,
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.000]   they are likely to go with the least amount of challenge
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.520]   so that they can continue to receive that praise or feedback.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.000]   Whereas if you receive praise and feedback
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.960]   for your strong effort,
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.920]   then later you tend to pick environments,
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.160]   problem sets, et cetera,
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.460]   that allow you to exert the very effort
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.420]   that got you the praise in the first place.
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.800]   So in both cases,
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.920]   these children are essentially attached to the praise,
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.000]   right, in some sense.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.060]   I mean, we like to think that they enjoy these activities
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.200]   and they're benefiting from them as well.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.480]   But in both cases,
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.440]   the praise really serves to reinforce a certain pattern
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.480]   of behavior.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.000]   But in the case of giving intelligence feedback,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.720]   the kids are really just trying to reinforce
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.560]   being told that they're smart or talented,
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.120]   as opposed to reinforcing the engagement in the activity
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.760]   that got them the praise in the first place.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.200]   And the converse is also true.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.880]   When kids are told, "Hey, you really tried hard,
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.140]   and that's great," or, "I like how you persisted,"
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.520]   or, "You're so persistent.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.560]   I can really see how persistent you are
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.360]   in trying to get the right answer,
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.120]   even if you don't get the right answer."
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.500]   Well, then when you present those kids
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.880]   with additional challenges,
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.660]   they work very hard to stay in challenge.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.500]   And guess what?
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.840]   No surprise.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.680]   The kids that are rewarded for effort
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.120]   and that continue to pick harder problems
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.940]   outperform the kids that are given the intelligence praise
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.900]   and feedback by a large margin.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.800]   So what does this tell us?
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.240]   This tells us that the narratives that we hear from others,
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.080]   of course, reinforce certain patterns of behavior.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.180]   What else does this tell us?
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.760]   This tells us that if you're a parent or teacher,
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.920]   you have to be very careful about giving feedback to a child
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.860]   that is attached to their identity around an endeavor,
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.920]   especially if they're performing well at that endeavor.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.760]   Now, of course,
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.100]   if a child is not performing well at something,
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.720]   you also don't want to tell them that they're stupid.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.520]   You don't want to tell them that they're deficient.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.840]   But that's a rare occurrence in the classroom,
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.860]   one would hope.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.500]   That's a rare occurrence on the field, one would hope.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.160]   But what's very common, very, very common,
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.080]   is that when we see children or adults performing well,
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.780]   we tend to give them identity labels
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.340]   as a way to try and reinforce whatever behavior
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.020]   we observe and we like.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.580]   Now, the other thing they looked at in the study,
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.820]   besides whether or not these kids would pick
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.680]   hard or easier challenges down the line,
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.680]   were the actual raw performance on cognitive problems.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.500]   And these data, I must say, are just so interesting.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.400]   They took the kids and they gave them
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.220]   all the same problem sets.
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.100]   And all the kids across the board,
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.380]   whether or not they were getting intelligence praise
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.620]   or effort praise, or they were in the control group,
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.980]   were performing more or less the same way.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.520]   They were getting some of these questions right,
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.440]   some of these questions wrong.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.400]   Then they gave them praise
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.300]   after they completed those problems.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.100]   They either got intelligence praise,
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.500]   you're so smart, you're so talented,
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.520]   or they got effort praise.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.600]   You tried so hard, you really persisted, that's fantastic.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.840]   Then later they gave them another set of problems
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.820]   and they looked at performance.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.560]   Now, remember, the first time around,
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.360]   all the kids got some of the questions right
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.780]   and some of the questions wrong.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.440]   So there's room for improvement for everybody.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.200]   What they found was absolutely striking.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.100]   The kids that were in the control group,
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.600]   so they didn't get any specific form of praise,
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.840]   they performed more or less the same way as they did before.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.600]   So if they were getting 75% of the answers right
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.320]   the first time, they got 75% of the answers right
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.020]   the second time, 25% wrong in both cases.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.280]   The kids that were in the intelligence praise group,
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.080]   the you're so smart, you're so talented praise group,
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.920]   their performance went down significantly.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.960]   Whereas the kids that were in the effort praise group,
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.200]   their performance increased significantly, okay?
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.440]   So this is a bi-directional effect
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.160]   where giving intelligence praise reduces performance
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.040]   and giving effort praise improves performance,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.980]   which is absolutely striking
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.920]   and tells you everything you need to know,
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.260]   which is if you're a parent, you're a teacher,
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:22:00.080]   and of course, as we all give ourselves feedback,
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.760]   rewarding yourself for effort
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.920]   is the best way to improve performance.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.420]   Rewarding yourself based on identity labels,
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.280]   so smart, so talented, you're a great athlete, et cetera,
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.480]   all that stare in the mirror and do self-affirmation stuff
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.500]   can actually undermine performance.
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.800]   And in fact, it does undermine performance.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.360]   It may not do it right away, but eventually it does.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.460]   And in a moment, I'll explain why.
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.760]   The other thing this study looked at
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.140]   that I just have to mention is this notion of persistence.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:27.980]   So remember earlier,
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.120]   I said that the kids that got intelligence praise
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.040]   tended to pick easier problems down the line,
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.820]   whereas the kids that got effort praise
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.620]   tended to pick harder problems.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.900]   It turns out that the kids that got intelligence praise
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.820]   also tended to take on fewer problems overall.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.520]   They tended to limit the total number of challenges
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.740]   that they engaged in.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.720]   Whereas the kids that got the effort praise,
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.540]   that you worked so hard, you're so determined,
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.840]   that was so impressive how you just kept going,
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.720]   even when you got some answers wrong.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.000]   Those kids not only opted for harder challenges,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.960]   they not only performed better,
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.160]   but they also took on many more challenges.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.760]   So these data really make clear
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.200]   that the effort praise is the way to go.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.000]   Now, I know many people have heard this whole thing
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.760]   about don't reward the person, reward the effort,
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.480]   reward the verbs as I'm referring to it,
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.560]   but it's actually pretty rare
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.100]   that we hear effort rewarded in everyday settings.
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.480]   And it is very common for us
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.780]   to overhear intelligence praise or talent praise.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.100]   You know, a kid comes home with a trophy
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.220]   and we tell them you're a great athlete, right?
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.540]   Kid comes home with a great report card,
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.800]   you know, you're so smart, congratulations.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.720]   A kid comes home with some sort of win in their world
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.480]   and we tend to give them a label
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.860]   because we like to think
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.600]   that that label will get internalized
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.500]   and they'll start to view themselves as a winner.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.720]   We tell them you can do anything,
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.820]   you're a winner, you're a winner.
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.060]   And of course, you don't want to tell children or yourself
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.520]   or any other adult you're a loser, right?
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.020]   We do not want to do that.
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.380]   You don't want to undermine performance that way.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.060]   But it's very clear based on this research
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:58.000]   and a lot of other papers similar to it
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.660]   that we all have a giant blind spot
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.740]   sitting in our psychological field
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.660]   when we are getting and receiving praise
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.680]   that really it is the sort of praise
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.140]   that's attached to the very efforts that led to the results
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.240]   that will lead to even improved results over time.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.600]   Okay, so this paper is really, truly important.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.720]   It's a landmark paper in the field of psychology,
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.440]   motivation, learning, and performance.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.400]   And that's why I'm discussing it in such detail here.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.100]   But it actually includes one additional piece of information
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.980]   that I also think everyone should know about.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.420]   And that is the tendency for children
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.840]   who get intelligence praise
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.540]   to misrepresent their performance on subsequent efforts.
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.560]   What do I mean by that?
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.640]   Basically what I'm saying is in this paper,
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.980]   they had the children perform on a given task,
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.060]   and then they either got intelligence praise,
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.080]   you're so smart, you're so talented, or effort praise.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.940]   You worked so hard, you're so diligent,
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.880]   you kept going even when you were faced
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.380]   with results you didn't like.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.400]   And then they had them do a series of other tasks
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.780]   and then report their results to other kids.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.040]   And what they found is that children
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.860]   who get intelligence praise,
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.780]   when they need to report their scores,
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.740]   either by walking up to the board and putting a little mark
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.120]   where their particular score is,
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.580]   or telling another student what their score was,
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.100]   or even writing it down on a piece of paper covertly
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.100]   so that it's not visibly being compared
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.560]   to all the other scores,
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.140]   the kids that got intelligence praise
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.340]   tend to lie about their score.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.180]   And as you could imagine,
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.780]   they tend to lie in the direction
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.300]   of making themselves appear as having performed better
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.040]   than they actually did.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.180]   So this is a pretty sinister aspect of intelligence praise
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.900]   that we don't often hear about.
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.580]   Even if you've heard telling a person
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.140]   that they are smart or talented
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.420]   can ultimately undermine performance,
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.260]   rarely, if ever, do we hear that telling someone
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.720]   that they're smart or talented can increase the probability
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.980]   that that person is going to misrepresent their performance
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.180]   in the future.
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.820]   And that's true regardless of whether or not
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.740]   they performed pretty well or not in the past.
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.100]   I mean, you could imagine that the kids
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.040]   that were told that they were intelligent,
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.060]   that they're talented, that those kids,
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.480]   if they were doing well and then suddenly did poorly,
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.800]   that they slide the score up a little bit.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.120]   We don't want anyone to do that,
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.120]   but you can imagine how a young kid might do that
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.900]   to kind of preserve their ego.
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:16.360]   But no, in some cases,
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.180]   these kids are already performing pretty well.
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.260]   They're not getting 100%,
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.900]   but they're performing in the top bracket.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.200]   And yet if they received intelligence praise,
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.980]   they're still more likely to lie about their performance,
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.980]   increasing it further still.
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.900]   Whereas the kids that receive the effort praise
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.920]   do no such thing.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.700]   They faithfully represent their performance.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.280]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.680]   for many reasons that we'll talk about in a few minutes,
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.140]   meaning the mechanisms and what's really going on
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.260]   in the heads of these kids that get effort praise,
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.320]   they're performing better than everybody else.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.060]   So just to illustrate how important the findings
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.660]   in this study really are, the paper was published in 1998.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.820]   But just two years prior in 1996,
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.740]   there was a survey of parents asking,
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.740]   "To what extent do you believe that intelligence is fixed?"
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.760]   And 85% answered that they thought
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.120]   that intelligence was fixed.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.820]   That means they believe that the brain
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.940]   was sort of a vessel of fixed size that, of course,
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.340]   when we're born into the world, it's kind of empty,
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.480]   we don't have any knowledge,
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.440]   but that the job of schooling was to teach kids things
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.560]   and reveal an intelligence capacity that was innate
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.860]   and that couldn't be increased upon.
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.500]   Whereas nowadays we really understand,
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.560]   mainly through our deeper understanding of neuroplasticity
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.480]   and how the brain learns, that indeed the brain can learn
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.580]   and that intelligence is not fixed.
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.340]   However, in 1998, when these studies were done,
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.940]   most people were of the core belief
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.780]   that intelligence is fixed,
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.740]   that it cannot be improved upon.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.180]   And these results really drive home the fact
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.560]   that the type of feedback we get about our performance,
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.100]   even when our performance is good,
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.460]   can undermine our future performance.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.900]   Or if we receive feedback of the effort praise type,
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.840]   the you tried so hard, you're so persistent type,
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.700]   that our abilities can indeed improve.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.380]   And when you look at any intelligence test,
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.940]   if you look at a standard IQ test,
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.820]   or you go way out onto the other end of the continuum
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.860]   in terms of intelligence testing,
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.780]   you look at emotional intelligence,
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.020]   it is very clear that anyone and everyone
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.740]   can improve their scores on those exams
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.900]   and in fact can improve the various aspects of intelligence
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.380]   because in fact there are many different forms
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.140]   of intelligence through dedicated effort.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.340]   So this paper was really ahead of its time
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.740]   and it's really what seeded the entire field
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.780]   of growth mindset and the understanding of what that is.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.180]   So now I'd like to shift our attention
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.700]   to not just how getting one form of praise
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.800]   or another form of praise can diminish or enhance performance
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.180]   but really to ask why that would be, how that is,
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.820]   because in that understanding,
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.700]   there's a very simple set of tools,
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.820]   of narratives that you can tell yourself
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.960]   or that you can tell a child as they are attempting to learn
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.640]   that can greatly enhance your or their ability to learn.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.420]   Before we go any further, however,
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.500]   I know many of you are listening to this
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.060]   with an eye toward the tools,
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.620]   meaning you want to know what the tools are
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.440]   that you can implement.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.500]   Well, earlier I had you ask some questions.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.320]   What are you good at?
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.020]   If you've been told you're good at
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.920]   and how did you arrive at being good at those things?
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.800]   I also encourage you to think about
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.820]   what you've been told you're bad at or less good at
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.400]   and what you tell yourself you're bad at and less good at
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.460]   and how you arrived at that conclusion.
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.820]   Right now, I'd like you to ask yourself,
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.940]   what is your typical narrative when you are engaging
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.620]   in things that you believe you are good at
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.920]   and what is your typical narrative,
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.600]   meaning your internal dialogue in your head,
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.580]   when you're engaging in things that you are not good at
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.100]   or if you're not engaging in those things
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.180]   when you think about engaging in those things?
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.180]   And the tool that's very effective to apply,
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.000]   even just in your own mind,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.720]   is to start shifting your narrative
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.700]   from those performance narratives
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.860]   of being really good at something or bad at something,
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.340]   which in fairness are the labels I'm using here,
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.820]   but that's for sake of discussion and clarity,
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.900]   and to start to shift those narratives
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.300]   towards effort-related narratives.
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.180]   So I'll use myself as an example.
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.320]   I'm pretty good at learning and remembering things,
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.380]   cognitive information.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.460]   I'm pretty terrible at playing music.
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.440]   In fact, I'm downright terrible.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.640]   If I were to step back from those two statements,
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.480]   I could take an intelligence type praise narrative
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.620]   and tell myself, okay, I have a great memory, right?
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.920]   That's a intelligence praise type narrative.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.300]   Or I could tell myself the truth,
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.000]   which is I tend to spend a lot of time with information
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.840]   in different forms.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.680]   I listen to it.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.500]   I read it.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.340]   I write it down.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.180]   I highlight it.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.340]   I put it up on a whiteboard.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.860]   I tell myself that information again in my head.
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.480]   I think about it in different contexts.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.680]   I tell other people about it.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.140]   That's how I developed a good memory
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.780]   for certain types of information.
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:47.000]   And that's still how I continue to build my memory
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.720]   and my information bank in my head to this day.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.360]   It's not because I have a quote unquote great memory.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.760]   It's because I engage in certain verb processes
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.240]   to build up that memory, okay?
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.980]   I can also take a look at the,
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.680]   let's call it the negative statement.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.800]   I am abysmal at music, which frankly is a fair statement.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.860]   And I could say, okay, I'm just a terrible musician.
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.180]   I have no musical sense.
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.480]   I have no musical ability.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.660]   Those are labels of the intelligence type labels.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.280]   Or I could look at the verbs.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.200]   This is also true.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.560]   I have never really spent a lot of time
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.120]   trying to learn an instrument.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.720]   I failed early on, at least in my mind.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.960]   I failed to get the results I wanted.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.740]   And so I stopped playing.
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.540]   I made the dog next door howl, which by the way I did.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.260]   So I stopped playing.
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.180]   I ceased the effort process.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.580]   And so in looking at it through that lens,
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.260]   yes, I'm a terrible musician,
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.720]   but I'm a terrible musician as a consequence
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.640]   of having never really engaged in the types of behaviors
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.020]   and effort over time that would have allowed me
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.760]   to be anything but a terrible musician.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.860]   Now, I'm not asking you to do this exercise
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.560]   simply as a way to puff yourself up
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.860]   about the things you're good at
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.400]   and reward yourself for all the effort that went into it.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.100]   Nor am I asking you to look at the things
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.320]   that you're not good at
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.240]   and trying to take away some of the shame and blame,
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.520]   although that would be a good thing as well,
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.880]   that led to the fact that you're not good at these things.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.160]   The reason I'm requesting that you ask those questions
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.180]   of yourself is that they can start to give you a sense
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:19.620]   of the actual tools and how those tools are implemented
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.520]   in order to get better at the things
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.720]   that you want to get better at.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.620]   And, and this is a very important and,
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.800]   to not set yourself up for getting worse at the things
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.580]   that you already think you're good at,
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.860]   because as we'll soon talk about,
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.820]   when we attach performance labels
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.840]   to things that we are really good at,
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.860]   we internalize that sense of self.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.600]   Oh, I'm good at this particular thing.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.320]   In my case, if I gave a performance label
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.120]   or an intelligence label, it would be of the sort,
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.740]   okay, I have a great memory.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.480]   But what happens when someone gives themselves
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.000]   or hears a performance or intelligence label
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.460]   around something that they're good at
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.420]   and then has an error or has a period
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.120]   where they're not that good at something?
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.680]   Well, if you internalized a sense of identity
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.680]   around performing well at that thing,
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.040]   and then at some point you don't perform well,
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.220]   you will also attach your identity
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.120]   to that diminished performance.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.480]   Whereas if you attach effort, verbs,
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.840]   to why you got good at something,
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.260]   as well as why you are not good at something,
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.200]   well, then there's only room for improvement.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.120]   Why do I say that?
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.160]   Well, when we're talking about effort,
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.960]   we're talking about verbs, that is inherent to you.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.960]   If you did it in one context, you can do it in another.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.520]   Whereas ability and performance,
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.300]   it's not the case that if you have a good memory,
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.040]   you are by default a good musician.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.340]   That might be the case, but in my case, certainly it's not.
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.660]   The point being that when you think about
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.740]   the effort processes that you've engaged before
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.480]   and over and over again,
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.920]   that allows you to continue to get better
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.120]   in a given domain, even when, or perhaps we should say,
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.360]   especially when you stop getting the results you want
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.000]   or you start getting poor results,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.140]   and that effort process of practicing a lot,
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:01.000]   many repetitions,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.360]   analyzing why you didn't get something right,
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.200]   that can be engaged in a lot of different endeavors
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.240]   across domains, as we say.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.660]   So when we talk about verbs like effort or persistence
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.880]   or practicing a lot or analyzing errors
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.500]   and why you did something incorrectly
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.200]   and then getting back to the drawing board, as it's called,
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.400]   when you start to think about your successes
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.360]   and your failures through those lenses,
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.780]   through the lens of verbs,
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.280]   then you're really talking about something
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.040]   that's central to who you are.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.400]   It's how you're wired.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.360]   It's machinery that exists in your brain
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.400]   and nervous system and body
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.040]   that you can engage that time and any time.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.640]   As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.080]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.400]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.220]   that's designed to meet
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.460]   all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.080]   And of course, I try to get enough servings
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.380]   of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.640]   that include vegetables and fruits every day,
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.300]   but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.280]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.040]   and the probiotics that I need,
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.200]   and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.000]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.540]   I have more focus and energy and I sleep better,
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.760]   and it also happens to taste great.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.640]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.340]   if you could take just one supplement, what would it be?
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.920]   I answer, AG1.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.080]   If you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.560]   to claim a special offer.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.120]   From now until August 12th, 2023,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.460]   AG1 is giving away 10 free travel packs
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.180]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.600]   Again, if you go to drinkag1.com/huberman,
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.600]   you can claim the special offer of 10 free travel packs
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.360]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.580]   Okay, so I've been talking about cognitive
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.480]   or psychological processes.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.280]   And the basic take home is that labels of intelligence,
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.260]   labels of identity undermine performance.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.340]   And a striking aspect of that, by the way,
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.600]   which I failed to mention earlier, but I should have,
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.020]   is that if we receive those labels of being a high performer,
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.880]   smart, talented, et cetera,
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:06.880]   either before or after a given task or game or exam,
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:12.040]   it still has a detrimental effect in both cases.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.160]   Meaning you tell someone heading into something,
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.240]   you're a great athlete, you are so smart,
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.280]   you're going to do so well on this exam,
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.080]   you undermine their performance.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.320]   Or if they take the exam and afterwards,
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.720]   before you see their scores or even after they score,
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.140]   let's say they get an A plus, they get everything perfect,
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.980]   and you say, you are so smart, you are so talented,
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.840]   you are undermining their performance on the next exam.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.580]   That's how striking these results are.
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.680]   And again, they've been shown again and again
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.320]   in different populations of students and adults.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.060]   Conversely, it's striking how powerful the effort labels
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.920]   can be at improving performance.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.040]   Conversely, and fortunately,
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.420]   the same is true for effort-based praise.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.580]   So if before a kid or adult heads into a competition or exam
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.620]   or preparation for a competition and exam, you say,
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:03.220]   you know what, I know you to be a really dedicated worker,
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.000]   you really persist, you know how to do hard things.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.440]   You really dig your heels when it gets hard
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.880]   and you overcome challenges.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.640]   If you do that before that child or adult
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.500]   heads into challenge, they will perform better.
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.140]   And if after an exam or performance or practice,
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.940]   whatever the effort happens to be,
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.920]   you tell them you really worked hard.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.280]   I love the way that even when you got kicked in the shin
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.780]   and you're limping along there and you're hurt,
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.360]   you continue to play.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.200]   Or even when everyone else went to sleep
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.480]   and you continue to study, although by the way,
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.340]   I do encourage people to get enough sleep,
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.440]   there are times in which, let's face it,
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.880]   the person who stays up late is studying
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.680]   provided they get enough sleep,
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.320]   they're getting the extra hours in, right?
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.280]   I might've been that kid in college
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.680]   or tried to be that kid in college.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.480]   If you reward effort after the effort,
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.480]   you also set the mind, the brain of that child or adult up
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.960]   to provide more effort to future endeavors.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.800]   So it's very clear.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.600]   It doesn't matter if the timing of the praise comes before
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.500]   or after a given bout of effort or performance.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.880]   You give identity praise before, performance diminishes.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.320]   You give identity praise after,
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.840]   subsequent performance diminishes.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:20.040]   You give effort praise before, performance goes up.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.400]   You give effort praise after, performance goes up.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.400]   So I know I sound a little bit like a broken record,
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.280]   but we hear so often about growth mindset,
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.240]   about giving the right form of praise,
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.440]   but it's not often that we are told when to give that praise.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.920]   And the short answer of course is it doesn't matter.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.720]   In fact, we should always be striving to give others
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.860]   and ourselves praise that is correctly attached
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.000]   to genuine effort.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.040]   And that word correctly is important here.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.280]   I'm not saying, you know,
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.260]   take a kid who performed poorly on an exam
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.420]   because they kind of loafed
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.020]   or the kid that was just shuffling their feet out
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:54.860]   on the soccer field and say,
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.660]   "Hey, great, you know, you worked so hard when they didn't."
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.780]   You know, we know when we're being lied to
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:01.860]   or when we're lying to ourselves,
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.480]   but that should give you a sense of control,
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.480]   not a sense of lack of control,
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.080]   because ultimately effort is something that we can control.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.740]   In fact, whenever I hear the term
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.780]   control what you can control,
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.820]   I get a little bit nauseated and a little bit irritated too,
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.120]   because it's never clear what people are referring to
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.600]   when they say control what you can control,
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.320]   focus on what you can control.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.240]   What's the thing that we all really can control?
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.200]   It's our level of persistence and our level of effort.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.300]   And of course we all have different circumstances
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.080]   such that persistence and effort can be harder
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.280]   in certain circumstances and for certain people, certainly.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.040]   But at the end of the day, at the end of the year,
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.260]   and at the end of our life,
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.000]   really the only thing that you really truly can control
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.520]   is where you place your attention
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.360]   and where you place your effort.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.100]   Those are the two things that are really inherent to you
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.000]   and your nervous system.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.100]   No one can do the effort for us.
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.880]   No one can direct our attention for us.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.240]   Things and people can try and divert
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.500]   or distract our attention and our effort,
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.720]   but ultimately effort and attention,
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.100]   that is intrinsic motivation,
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.380]   come, as the name suggests, directly from us.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.920]   Okay, so it's clear that we have a striking set of results
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.780]   in the literature.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.660]   And again, major hat tip to Carol Dweck and her colleagues
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.380]   for making this discovery, right?
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.440]   It is what eventually led to the discovery
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.280]   of growth mindset.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.420]   And it's what we're really building up to here.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.580]   Okay, so this early work from Dweck and colleagues,
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.960]   and by early I mean late 90s, right, is really spectacular.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.740]   It really transformed the way that we think about education
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.820]   and learning in general, and in fact, neuroplasticity.
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:38.340]   But what it didn't answer is why.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:41.620]   Why is it that effort praise leads to better performance
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:43.780]   and intelligence praise, identity praise,
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.260]   leads to diminished performance?
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.220]   And it turns out that the answer resides
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.660]   in how people respond to errors,
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.680]   how they respond to feedback that they did not want.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.640]   And there's a really nice study
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.980]   that looked at this mechanistically in the brain
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.680]   to ask what's going on under the hood,
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.220]   meaning within the brain,
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.420]   when people who have one mindset or another
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.700]   adopt a growth mindset,
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.200]   that is the idea that if they engage in effort,
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.420]   that they can get better at things,
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.260]   or if they have what's called a fixed mindset,
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.060]   this idea that if they're not performing well,
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:17.140]   it must be because they just simply can't perform well.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:20.480]   They don't have the capacity or the ability to perform well.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.500]   So the study I'm referring to is a study,
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.420]   first author Mangels, last author,
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.780]   no surprise, Carol Dweck, and it's entitled,
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.640]   "Why do beliefs about intelligence
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.300]   influence learning success?
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.180]   A social cognitive neuroscience model."
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.640]   I'm not going to go into all the details of this study,
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.500]   but this study used what's called ERPs,
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.660]   event-related potentials.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.380]   Event-related potentials are measured
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.540]   by putting a cap on the skull that has a bunch of electrodes
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.020]   but they don't penetrate the skull.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:49.300]   They're picking up electrical potentials
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.980]   that correlate with shifts in brain activity.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:56.220]   Now, an advantage of ERPs is that it's pretty noninvasive.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.340]   You can even do it on babies.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.540]   You don't have to cut into the skull.
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.160]   You don't have to remove any skin as you would
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:04.600]   if you were going to put electrodes down into the brain,
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.400]   which essentially is neurosurgery.
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.480]   And it's not as disruptive
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.480]   as being put into a functional magnetic imaging machine
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.800]   where you're put into a tube
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.920]   and you have to lie motionless for an hour or more.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.240]   Actually, it was in a MRI machine,
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.460]   not for any clinical reason,
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.020]   but just as a diagnostic scan recently.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.480]   And nowadays they allow you to watch Netflix in there
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.740]   or do something, but you have to stay very, very still.
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.120]   So it's hard for a lot of people to do that,
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.400]   but it can be done if you need it to be done, you do it.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.960]   But ERPs are great
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.940]   because people can come into the laboratory,
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.480]   put on this skull cap.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.480]   It's kind of this funny thing,
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.020]   or it looks funny with all these little wires
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:39.860]   coming out of it.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.440]   And you can get a fairly good measure
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.680]   of global levels of activity across the brain.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.880]   You can't really pinpoint fine structures
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.360]   and you can't look at brain activity deep in the brain.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.080]   That's probably the major drawback
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.460]   of looking at these ERPs,
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:57.840]   but you can see global shifts in activity across the brain
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.960]   and the other advantage is you can do that
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.480]   while people are engaging a lot of different types of tasks.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.200]   You can move around a lot.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.760]   Whereas when you're in an MRI machine,
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.220]   you're in that little tube, you can't really do much.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.280]   So this study had people equipped with these skull caps.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.520]   It looks kind of like a hoodie
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.720]   with a bunch of wires coming out of it.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.120]   And they had them play a game.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.920]   Basically what they did is they were asked questions.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.840]   These are trivia type questions
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.320]   like what's the capital of Australia?
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.020]   Australians, you're not allowed to answer that question,
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.160]   but everyone else should try.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.460]   And then here I'm paraphrasing,
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.400]   people indicated their confidence
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.720]   in how accurate they were with the response.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.260]   Okay, so they asked him a question
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.520]   like what's the capital of Australia?
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.840]   The person would answer and then they say,
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.720]   how confident are you on a scale of say one to 10
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.600]   that you got the answer correct?
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.040]   And then they were given two pieces of feedback.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.960]   And the first piece of feedback provided information
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.920]   only about their response accuracy.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.280]   Were they right or were they not right?
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:00.200]   And then the second feedback was they got the correct answer.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.660]   So this is a pretty clever experimental design
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.480]   because it allowed the researchers
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.560]   to look at people's thinking
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.020]   as they're trying to get the right answer,
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.040]   then compare that to how confident they were
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.560]   that they had the right answer, right?
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.840]   You could imagine that if someone was really confident,
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.780]   like if you asked me, what's your name?
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.540]   And I say, Andrew, what's my confidence
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.540]   that my name is Andrew?
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:24.660]   75%, just kidding, 100%, okay, 100%.
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.700]   Whereas if you asked me,
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:29.500]   I was confronted with this the other day,
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.980]   in your physics class,
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:33.240]   when they talked about the right hand rule,
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.860]   which is, if you're listening, don't worry about it,
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.940]   it's just when you put out your index finger,
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.360]   your middle finger and your thumb with your right hand.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:44.020]   In the right hand rule is the magnetic field,
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.900]   the middle finger, the index finger, the thumb,
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.520]   and I'm pretty sure that it's the,
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.580]   the magnetic field is the middle finger,
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.860]   that's the vector of the middle finger.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.940]   But how confident am I in this result?
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.580]   I don't know, maybe 50%,
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.200]   because it's been a while since I've looked at this stuff.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.980]   And I should know this, but I haven't looked at it, so 50%.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.220]   When you give people these kinds of questions
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.580]   while recording brain activity,
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.420]   you're getting a lot of information.
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:10.720]   You're looking at accuracy,
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.140]   you're also looking at confidence,
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.540]   you're looking at lack of confidence,
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:14.420]   and you can correlate that
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.140]   with different patterns of brain activity.
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.800]   Now, they had essentially two groups of people in the study.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.040]   One group had an intelligence mindset,
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.500]   they believed intelligence was more or less fixed.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.340]   The other had what we call a growth mindset.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:27.620]   They believed that through effort,
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:28.900]   that intelligence was malleable,
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.240]   that people could learn new information,
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.500]   including themselves, they could learn new information.
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.580]   And you wouldn't necessarily think that these two groups
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:38.300]   would show different patterns of brain activity
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.340]   in response to getting things right or wrong
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.440]   while the brain was being imaged,
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.960]   but in fact, that's exactly what happened.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.160]   There's a certain wave form of activity,
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.000]   the name isn't really important,
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.220]   but you'd call it the P3 wave in these ERP experiments.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.560]   P3 wave is a certain pattern of activity
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:59.580]   that emerged during the presentation to the subject
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.380]   that they'd gotten something wrong.
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.120]   So the P3 wave,
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:05.940]   it's just a little blip in neural activity in the brain
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.340]   correlated with when people were told,
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.340]   "Nope, you got that one wrong," okay?
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.260]   And what was really interesting
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.640]   is that the height of the P3,
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.380]   this, let's just call it an error signal
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.380]   'cause it correlated with the error signal,
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.580]   this, "Nope, you got it wrong," signal in the brain,
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.600]   that signal was larger in people with a fixed mindset
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.640]   as opposed to in people with the growth mindset.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.020]   Now, what was especially interesting
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:33.880]   is that the location of that activity
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.140]   was above a brain area called
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:39.300]   the anterior cingulate cortex, the ACC.
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.380]   The anterior cingulate cortex is a structure
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:44.280]   involved in many different functions in the brain,
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.560]   but one of its primary functions
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.660]   is that in the front of the ACC,
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.440]   what we call the rostral or interior ACC,
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:56.580]   activity there tends to correlate with emotional responses.
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.720]   It tends to correlate with our internal sense,
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.160]   so-called interoception,
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.880]   whereas in the dorsal ACC, meaning the top of the ACC,
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.660]   activity there tends to correlate
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:11.080]   with cognitive information and cognitive appraisal,
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.260]   meaning this structure has a lot of different functions,
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.860]   but it's got a little area within it
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.840]   that tends to be more related to our emotional
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.120]   or somatic responses to things,
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.760]   and it's got another area inside of it
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.740]   that tends to be more related to our thinking,
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.460]   our cognition, and what was really interesting
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.500]   is that in the group that had the fixed mindset,
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.160]   when they were told that they got something wrong,
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.980]   there tended to be a greater signal
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.540]   in that rostral or anterior ACC,
[00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:38.840]   meaning they had a bigger emotional response to it,
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:41.500]   or at least the neural activity suggested that,
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.340]   whereas people with a growth mindset,
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:46.560]   when presented with, "Eh, you got something wrong,"
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:49.780]   the error signal, the error signal within their brain
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.500]   tended to reside or even to shift
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.740]   toward areas that are associated with cognitive appraisal,
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.280]   and so the conclusion of this study,
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.860]   as well as other studies
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.300]   using functional magnetic resonance imaging
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.280]   that have looked at similar tasks,
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.620]   is that when people have a growth mindset
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:09.220]   and they are presented with the information
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.280]   that they got something wrong,
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:14.880]   rather than just feel it as a somatic response
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.020]   or an emotional response, they tend to appraise it.
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.440]   They tend to direct their attentional resources
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.500]   toward trying to understand what the error was
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.540]   and why they got that error,
[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.900]   and this, I believe, is absolutely fundamental
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.340]   to understanding the distinction
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:32.060]   between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset,
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.900]   because perhaps you've seen these lists,
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.180]   these side-by-side lists
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:39.340]   that a fixed mindset versus a growth mindset.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:43.560]   Fixed mindset is one in which you're trying to look smart,
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.620]   that you're not so focused on effort,
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:49.520]   that your response to setbacks is to give up,
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.760]   and your academic and other forms of performance
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.480]   tends to be low, whereas in a growth mindset,
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.180]   your goal tends to be to learn,
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.100]   you tend to value effort more,
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.920]   you tend to respond to setbacks by working harder,
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.840]   and your performance is higher,
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.200]   and I'm not trying to make light of these lists.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.040]   These lists are important
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.780]   because they help us organize our information
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.940]   and differentiate between a fixed versus growth mindset,
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:13.300]   but they don't tell us why focusing on effort
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:14.520]   and engaging more effort
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.020]   would actually translate into higher performance.
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:18.940]   For instance, you could imagine a scenario
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.900]   where the exact opposite is true, right?
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:23.260]   We could make up a just-so story
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.900]   where if your identity is so rigidly fixed
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.020]   to high performance, you're likely to outwork everybody.
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:31.740]   That seems like a logical conclusion as well,
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.900]   but that's not the way it plays out.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.300]   It's when your identity is attached
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:41.060]   to your sense of ability to engage in ongoing effort,
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:43.520]   especially when you receive signals
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.260]   that you're getting things wrong or not performing well,
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:49.100]   that is tied to elevated performance.
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:50.860]   And the study using ERPs tells us
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.600]   that's likely to be the case
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.300]   because of how people who have a growth mindset
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.480]   focus their attention when they're told,
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.260]   "Nope, you got that wrong,"
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:02.400]   or when people think they got something right, right?
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.420]   They give an answer and they say,
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.560]   "What's your confidence level?"
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:08.300]   And they say, "90%, maybe 99%, maybe even 100%."
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.080]   And they say, "Hmm, it's wrong."
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.480]   People who have a fixed mindset
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.880]   focus on the emotional response to that.
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.160]   More of their brain resources are devoted to,
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.940]   "Ah, I got it wrong. I thought I got it right."
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:22.500]   Then the people who have a growth mindset who are thinking,
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.440]   "Wait, okay, then what was that answer?
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.360]   And how could I possibly get that answer wrong?
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.260]   I'm going to figure that out," okay?
[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.040]   Now, as you're hearing this, you're probably thinking,
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.140]   "Oh no, I'm somebody who reflexively gets disappointed
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:35.460]   when I get something wrong."
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:37.400]   Well, fortunately, this is not just about
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.480]   that 100 milliseconds to five seconds
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.060]   after you're told something is wrong.
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.620]   You can shift from a fixed mindset
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:45.400]   to a growth mindset response.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.040]   In fact, that's an important tool
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.880]   that we all need to learn how to implement.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.680]   We all suffer from fixed mindset,
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.800]   all suffer from fixed mindset in certain endeavors.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:55.960]   And when we get things wrong,
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.860]   especially when there's some embarrassment or shame,
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.460]   which often accompanies when we think we were very right,
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.180]   we're convinced we're right,
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:07.740]   that fixed mindset can really hijack our emotional response.
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:11.080]   But there are a lot of data that point to the fact that
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.320]   at those moments, if we think,
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.000]   "Okay, I'm going to step back from that
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.600]   and I'm going to just think about the error.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.140]   I'm going to think about what led to the error,
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:19.480]   and I'm going to start devoting my attentional resources
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.480]   to that process."
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.940]   That process itself can be built up over time
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.760]   such that we start to outweigh the fixed mindset
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.740]   with growth mindset.
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:32.960]   Simply by devoting our attentional resources to the error,
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.200]   acknowledging it happened,
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.300]   maybe feeling something about it, maybe not.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.680]   It's really hard to control our feelings.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.500]   What we can control, as I mentioned before,
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.880]   is our effort and our attention.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.080]   So focusing our attention on why we got something wrong
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.180]   and really digging into that,
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:48.360]   that's growth mindset in action.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.100]   So you'll notice as we have this discussion
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:53.100]   about the more mechanistic underpinnings of growth mindset
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:56.880]   is that we're not talking about psychological terms as much.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.040]   We're not talking about ego protection.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.000]   We're not talking about identity.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.920]   Now, all of those things are extremely important,
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.800]   but the problem with things like ego protection and identity
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:10.160]   is that when we are faced with results that we don't want,
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.240]   and we are faced with those results in a real world context,
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:16.160]   like we're not getting the results we want in school,
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:20.220]   in work, in athletics, in relationships, et cetera,
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:23.600]   we hear these messages and we try to, for instance,
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.000]   set our ego aside or not attach our identity
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.600]   so much to what is happening, but it's really, really hard.
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.040]   And it's really, really hard
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.040]   because statements like set your ego aside
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.300]   or don't attach yourself to it so much
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:41.860]   are wonderful aspirations, but there's no actual process
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.880]   that one can go through by oneself
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.400]   that allows you to immediately disentangle yourself
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.800]   from your ego, right?
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.380]   I mean, there's this whole process of ego dissolution
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:52.600]   that we talked about in the episode
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.400]   with Robin Cardart Harris,
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.640]   but none of that was directed at specific challenges
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.400]   that one is undertaking in real time, right?
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.160]   So when you're faced with results that you don't like,
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.500]   you can't simply step back,
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.180]   nor should you expect yourself to be able to step back
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.440]   and say, "Oh, I'm not going to get upset about this error,"
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.640]   right, it makes perfect sense why you would get upset
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.580]   about not getting the results that you want.
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.500]   However, once you start to understand
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.200]   some of the mechanistic underpinnings
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.880]   of what will allow you to rescue your performance,
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.280]   that is to start focusing on those errors
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.960]   from a more cognitive and a slightly less emotional stance,
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:29.200]   or even a combination of emotional and cognitive, right?
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.540]   Because it's very hard to suppress
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:31.940]   our emotional response to something,
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.240]   but oftentimes we can enhance our attentional
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:37.640]   or cognitive response to something in parallel with that.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.480]   And in doing so,
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:41.600]   we can kind of rob some of the emotional response.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:44.360]   And when we do that sort of thing, it's hard.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.980]   And anytime we do hard things,
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.480]   we generally want to know that the doing
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.200]   of those hard things is working,
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.900]   that it's in service to something.
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:53.240]   And the study I just reviewed,
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.520]   as well as what I'm going to talk about next,
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:59.040]   really points to the fact that building up a practice,
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.980]   a capacity of focusing on one's effort,
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.880]   on focusing on the errors one made
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:06.760]   from a cognitive standpoint,
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.660]   and really trying to understand what led to those errors
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:11.960]   is the basis, it's the cornerstone
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.680]   of building up growth mindset.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.300]   It does, however, require that we don't just tell ourselves
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:18.400]   to focus on effort and the errors
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.960]   and analyzing those errors.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.000]   It also requires an additional piece,
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.040]   which is what we're going to talk about now.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.160]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.840]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.200]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.700]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.240]   to help you better understand your body
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.120]   and help you meet your health goals.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.460]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:40.780]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:43.000]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.600]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.620]   However, with a lot of blood tests out there,
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:49.500]   you get information back about blood lipids,
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.640]   about hormones and so on,
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.660]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.960]   With Inside Tracker, they have a personalized platform
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.720]   that makes it very easy to understand your data,
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.640]   that is to understand what those lipids,
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.620]   what those hormone levels, et cetera, mean,
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:04.800]   and behavioral supplement, nutrition, and other protocols
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.600]   to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.860]   that are ideal for your immediate and long-term health.
[00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:12.160]   Inside Tracker's ultimate plan now includes measures
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.380]   of both ApoB and of insulin,
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:17.020]   which are key indicators of cardiovascular health
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:18.600]   and energy regulation.
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.040]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.840]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:31.800]   Okay, so by now I like to think
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.820]   that we all understand what growth mindset is
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.980]   and what differentiates it from a fixed mindset.
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.220]   However, just understanding what growth mindset is
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:43.180]   and having a desire to implement it
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:46.260]   and a bit of understanding of how to implement it
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:49.040]   turns out to be necessary, but not sufficient.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.620]   There's an additional piece that we need to accomplish.
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:53.120]   The good news is that additional piece
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.260]   is very straightforward to understand.
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:59.100]   If we zoom out and we start to really understand
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:01.720]   that growth mindset is really a way
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:05.940]   of connecting motivation to cognition.
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.300]   It's taking this thing that we call motivation,
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:09.540]   which is of course what we all want.
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:10.580]   We all want to be motivated.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.740]   We all want to be effort-driven, et cetera.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:15.540]   And we take motivation and we tie it
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:18.400]   to a set of specific thoughts or thought processes
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.240]   that we can control.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.360]   That is far and away different than looking at motivation
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.760]   simply as an emotional or an internal state
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.080]   of quote unquote feeling motivated.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.600]   And in fact, that's what most people,
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.120]   including myself default to.
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:32.320]   We want to feel motivated.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.960]   So fortunately we try and get good sleep,
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.040]   which is essential.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.620]   That really helps for daytime mood focus and alertness
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.460]   and thereby motivation.
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:44.400]   We hydrate, we exercise, we might even drink caffeine
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.220]   as a way to increase our level of alertness and motivation.
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.580]   And all of that is finding good.
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.740]   In fact, all of that is encouraged,
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:53.640]   although I would say that the caffeine part is optional,
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.620]   but all of those other things are encouraged
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:57.700]   toward mental health, physical health and performance
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.700]   and motivation.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.540]   But what growth mindset is really about
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:04.860]   is it's taking this thing that we call motivation
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:05.980]   and it's saying, okay,
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:08.220]   what are the specific types of thoughts
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.160]   and actually the specific thoughts,
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.520]   the specific cognitive processes
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.800]   that will allow us to feel more motivated,
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.920]   especially under conditions
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.520]   where we feel something as hard
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:20.140]   or where we are not getting the results we want.
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.100]   And in order to master that process,
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:25.020]   we need to embrace another mindset.
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:26.180]   That's right.
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.400]   In order to access growth mindset,
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.960]   it's very clear that we need to be able to think about
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.120]   errors and we need to overcome errors
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.260]   and we need to devote our attention to errors.
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:38.040]   And we need to devote our attention to reframing
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.640]   what's going on in our head
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:42.000]   when we're feeling not motivated, et cetera.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.360]   And all of that is really hard to do
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.640]   from a purely psychological standpoint,
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.220]   but there's this additional mindset,
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:51.080]   which has to do with our mindset around stress
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.380]   and frustration itself
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:57.680]   that can allow us to access growth mindset far more easily.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:00.580]   And this mindset around stress actually has a name.
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:03.120]   It's called the stress is enhancing mindset.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.840]   And there's a very straightforward way
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:08.000]   to increase your stress is enhancing mindset.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.520]   So first I want to step back and acknowledge the person
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.940]   who really made some of the key fundamental discoveries
[00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:15.720]   in this area that we call stress is enhancing mindsets.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:20.060]   And that's Dr. Alia, sometimes referred to as Dr. Ali Krum.
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:23.480]   She's a tenured professor of psychology at Stanford.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.580]   She also is a former division one athlete
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.500]   and a licensed clinical psychologist.
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:29.220]   She's an absolute phenom.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:32.540]   And I promise you that she is so successful
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:36.320]   in all those categories by way of immense amounts of effort.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.160]   In addition to that,
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.620]   she also happens to be an incredibly kind person
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:40.460]   and generous person.
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:42.780]   She was a guest on this podcast previously.
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.740]   You can find that episode in the show note captions
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.280]   or by going to hubermanlab.com
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:50.460]   and simply searching for mindset, Krum, C-R-U-M.
[00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:52.500]   Her personal story and her work
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:55.460]   and the tool she offers are absolutely spectacular.
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:57.760]   However, you don't need to go to that episode just yet.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.820]   I'm going to talk about some of those tools now.
[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:01.860]   And I'm going to talk about how using those tools
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:03.900]   can allow you to access growth mindset.
[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:07.200]   And then I'm going to talk about how the combination
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.660]   of applying a stress is enhancing mindset
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:12.420]   with a growth mindset acts synergistically
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:15.120]   to even further improve performance in the short
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:15.960]   and long run.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:18.060]   The stress is enhancing mindset is the outgrowth
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:22.020]   of many different studies and not just from Dr. Ali Krum,
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:23.740]   but from others as well.
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:26.320]   But for the time being, I want to focus on one paper
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.460]   in which Dr. Krum was the first author.
[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:31.480]   So this work was done before she arrived at Stanford.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.780]   The paper is entitled Rethinking Stress,
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:37.100]   The Role of Mindsets in Determining the Stress Response.
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:39.740]   And the key takeaway from this paper is that
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:44.060]   how we think about stress impacts how we react to stress.
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:48.300]   So much so in fact, that what this paper illustrates
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:51.860]   is that if people are given even just a short tutorial
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:54.900]   about some of the negative consequences of stress
[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.700]   on learning and performance and their physiology
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.340]   and their health, they experience a lot
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.460]   of negative consequences of stress
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.980]   when they're put into a stressful circumstance.
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:07.200]   Conversely, if people are taught about the performance
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.700]   enhancing aspects of stress, then those people
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.220]   will experience performance enhancement
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.660]   when they are confronted with stress in a learning
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.620]   or other performance type environment.
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:20.700]   So what we are talking about here is not the placebo effect.
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.880]   I want to be very clear about that.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.500]   We are also not talking about lying to people
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.020]   in order to shift their response to stress.
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:31.300]   What we're talking about here is two different conditions.
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:34.400]   One condition where people are exposed to information
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.660]   that is true about how stress can diminish performance
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.740]   and another condition in which people are exposed
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.900]   to information that is also true
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:45.020]   about how stress can enhance performance.
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.060]   Now you might be saying, how can it be true
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.260]   that stress is both performance diminishing
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.580]   and stress is performance enhancing?
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:55.260]   And ah, therein lies the key takeaway from this paper.
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:58.260]   It depends on what you believe about stress.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.540]   In fact, a different way to umbrella this whole discussion
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:03.580]   is to say that how you think about stress
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:06.860]   impacts the stress response in profound ways.
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.640]   So this paper, Rethinking Stress,
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.160]   The Role of Mindsets in Determining Stress,
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.120]   did a very simple set of manipulations.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.600]   They had people in one group listen to a lecture
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.320]   that effectively was titled, quote,
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.440]   "The effects of stress are negative and should be avoided."
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.660]   And that lecture included information
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:26.220]   about how stress diminishes performance
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:28.940]   and how it can diminish health and vitality,
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.380]   learning and performance, productivity,
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:33.700]   it increases uncertainty, et cetera, okay?
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.720]   And all of that information is true.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.460]   A separate group listened to a lecture entitled, quote,
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:42.900]   "Experiencing Stress Improves Health and Vitality."
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.100]   And again, that information is true.
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.080]   Now I realize that some of you are probably still asking,
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.260]   how can it be that stress diminishes health and performance
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:53.840]   and stress also enhances health and performance?
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.300]   And the answer lies in two things.
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:00.340]   One, the level of stress and therefore the level of hormones
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:02.300]   that are released in response to that stress,
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:05.400]   the duration over which the stress response occurs.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.940]   But the key variable here is that
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:11.740]   our cognitive understanding about what stress does
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:14.700]   impacts whether or not our physiology goes
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.620]   down the direction of debilitating
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.620]   or enhancing effects of stress, okay?
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.980]   So we've got a condition here
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.140]   where people are being informed very differently
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:23.300]   about what stress does.
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.320]   In one case, it's the stress is bad message.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.900]   In the other case, it's the stress is good message.
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:30.600]   And there are many different experiments within this paper,
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.320]   but one of the more interesting ones I believe
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.560]   is where they looked at work performance,
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:39.160]   both in terms of performance of what they call soft tasks.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.380]   So these are somewhat easier tasks as well as hard tasks.
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:45.980]   And when you look at the group that was given information
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:50.860]   about how stress diminishes performance in the soft tasks,
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:52.660]   okay, so the somewhat easy tasks,
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:55.220]   you don't see much change in their performance
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.780]   as you compare the before the learning
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.480]   about stress is diminishing to after the learning.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.460]   Whereas the people who learn that stress is enhancing
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:07.860]   actually experience some improvement in work performance,
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.820]   even though the challenge that they're facing
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.780]   isn't that great.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.100]   So again, what this means is that learning that stress
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:17.300]   can enhance performance by providing people true information
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.380]   about how stress can enhance performance,
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:22.540]   can increase performance even in the context of stuff
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.680]   that's not that hard, not that stressful.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.980]   Even more interesting is that when you look at performance
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.900]   on tasks that are considered hard,
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.860]   and you compare the stress is diminishing group,
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:33.800]   meaning the group that was taught that stress is diminishing
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.880]   and compare that to the stress is enhancing group,
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.080]   you see a really divergent response.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.220]   The people that learn that stress diminishes performance
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:42.800]   did not improve at all.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.260]   Whereas the people that learn that stress
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.580]   can enhance performance,
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:48.080]   enhance their performance significantly.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.720]   Now keep in mind, all they are doing is learning
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.480]   that stress can enhance their performance.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.000]   And then they're given the task
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.460]   and they're performing better.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.040]   So that's pretty spectacular, right?
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.500]   There's no training session that they went and did.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.940]   They didn't practice these items
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.000]   that they were being tested on in between.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.500]   They weren't given a bunch of drills to do
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.220]   and they didn't take a lot of time to do it.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.580]   They just heard a tutorial about how stress
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.980]   can enhance performance.
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:15.420]   And that I believe is remarkable because what it says
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.120]   is that our cognitive appraisal about stress,
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.620]   which we all are going to experience in life, right?
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:23.720]   Elevated heart rate, narrowing of visual focus,
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.640]   shifting of blood away from the periphery.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.520]   All of these things are characteristic features
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.020]   of the stress response that we learn,
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.060]   especially in this day and age,
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.500]   'cause it's talked about a lot in popular culture,
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.600]   that, oh, you know, all of these mechanisms
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.980]   were put into us in order for us to get away
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:39.300]   from the saber-toothed tiger
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.680]   or the lion that's trying to eat us.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.580]   Let's be fair.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.340]   The stress response is there for a lot of reasons,
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.640]   not just because of saber-toothed tigers and lions.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.020]   I mean, that's kind of a story that we make up.
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.460]   The stress response is inherent, not just to us,
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:55.220]   but to other species as a way to mobilize us
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:57.520]   either away from things or toward things, right?
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.240]   We need to have somewhat of a stress response
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.600]   in order to engage in adaptive challenge.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.180]   Yes, it's true that hundreds and thousands of years ago,
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:07.320]   those adaptive challenges probably involved hunting,
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.860]   but they probably involved social challenges as well.
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:12.600]   Do you think it was easy for cavemen and women
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.000]   to engage socially and kind of settle out
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.940]   their romantic interactions, et cetera?
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:18.740]   Do you think it was easy for them to raise children?
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:19.800]   No, of course not.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.140]   The stress response is there for a variety of reasons,
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.180]   not just to get away from predators.
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:26.840]   The really exciting thing that's been discovered
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.620]   in the course of Ali Krum's work and other work
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:32.600]   in the last couple of decades is that the stress response
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.560]   is neither good nor bad.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.440]   The stress response depends on whether or not
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.920]   you believe the sensations that you're experiencing,
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.560]   elevated heart rate, narrowing of visual focus, et cetera,
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.600]   are serving to enhance your performance
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.160]   or diminish your performance.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.920]   And this study really points to the fact
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.200]   that just learning that it can enhance performance,
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.160]   can enhance performance.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.760]   Now, I know a number of you are probably saying,
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.100]   wait, but stress doesn't feel good, right?
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.860]   And oftentimes we experience stress under conditions
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:01.860]   where we're trying to learn or get good at something
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:03.340]   or listen better or do something,
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:05.600]   and it actually is diminishing performance.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.920]   And I think it's important to acknowledge that.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.400]   This study and studies like it are not saying
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:13.780]   that stress becomes pleasant as a sensation in the body,
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:15.900]   nor is it saying that it always leads
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.400]   to improved performance.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.200]   I don't want you to think that's the take-home message.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.100]   Sometimes it does, it can, as was demonstrated
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:25.640]   in this research paper, but oftentimes, as we know,
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.360]   stress diminishes our performance.
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:30.760]   It takes us away from the landmarks we want to hit.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.620]   It takes us away from the grades we want to get.
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:34.240]   It takes us away from quote unquote,
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.040]   showing up how we want to, right?
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.340]   No one wants to have the blotchy skin and the sweating
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:39.800]   and the quaking of voice when we're trying
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.000]   to do public speaking and things of that sort.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.840]   No one wants any of that.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.280]   What's important to understand is that learning that stress
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.600]   is a way of mobilizing resources in the body does two things.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:54.360]   First of all, it allows us to dampen
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:57.520]   or adjust the stress response in real time.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.480]   And it allows us to understand that that stress response
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.520]   heightens our level of focus in a way that allows us
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.800]   to pay attention to the things that are going wrong
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.160]   in a way that allows us to make correction
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.820]   to those errors in the future.
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.120]   So if you think back to that study, that ERP study,
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.320]   where they measured brain activity
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.160]   and they looked at people who had a fixed mindset
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.240]   versus people who had a growth mindset
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.160]   and the people who had a growth mindset
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.160]   were paying more cognitive attention
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.920]   to what was happening during errors and after errors.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:29.520]   Well, this stress is enhancing mindset is very powerful
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.880]   because what it does is it shifts one's attention
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.520]   away from the kind of somatic experience of,
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.920]   oh my goodness, my heart rate is elevated,
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.480]   I'm sweating, I'm quaking, I sound terrible,
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.680]   I feel terrible, I look terrible, et cetera,
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.920]   to a mode of allocating more of our thinking
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:47.120]   toward analyzing why things might be going wrong.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.760]   And something else powerful happens
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.780]   when we embrace a stress is enhancing mindset as well.
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:54.460]   When we embrace a stress is enhancing mindset,
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:57.980]   it turns out that some of the very physiological processes
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:02.080]   that we call quote unquote stress shift in important ways.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.400]   Some of those include the duration over which
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.560]   the stress hormone cortisol is released.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.060]   And in fact, I don't even really want to call it
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:11.560]   a stress hormone because cortisol does so many other things
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.200]   as well and it's not bad, you need cortisol.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.760]   Believe me, you want cortisol, especially released early
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.920]   in the day and in response to acute stressors.
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.480]   What you don't want is for cortisol to stay elevated
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:24.080]   for long, long periods of time and you especially
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.880]   don't want it to interfere with your sleep.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.960]   Okay, so much so that I think at times I wonder
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.440]   whether or not our philosophy on stress should be
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:36.520]   that stress is fantastic for us except when it interferes
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.640]   with our sleep, right?
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.620]   And when stress becomes terrible for us is when it starts
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:43.140]   to be chronically elevated and especially when it starts
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:46.860]   to inhibit our ability to sleep well enough and long enough.
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:51.260]   Okay, so the point here is that when we embrace a stress
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:55.960]   is enhancing mindset, we are able to have shorter duration
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.520]   release of cortisol, we are also able to engage
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.420]   what's called increased stroke volume under conditions
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:04.540]   of stress, this gets a little bit technical,
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.600]   but the amount of blood that your heart can pump
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.440]   with each beat turns out to be a key metric of stress.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.680]   When we are very stressed, even though we need to mobilize
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.300]   a lot of resources, somewhat paradoxically,
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:17.800]   our total stroke volume can actually be reduced
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.680]   and we tend to shuttle blood and other resources
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.780]   towards the core of our body and towards major limbs
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:26.600]   and away from things like our brain and our periphery.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.540]   So one of the key measures of how a stress response
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:33.180]   quote unquote is going is how much peripheral blood flow
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:35.600]   there is and when we are more relaxed under conditions
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.960]   of stress, there tends to be more peripheral blood flow.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.500]   When we are more anxious, more panicked under conditions
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.120]   of stress, peripheral blood flow is lower.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.020]   And in a remarkable set of experiments,
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:50.220]   Ali Krum and colleagues have shown that when we are just
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.820]   taught that stress can be enhancing and then we are placed
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:55.160]   into a stressful environment, either because we are
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.080]   imagining stress or we are experiencing real stress
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.940]   and then our physiology is measured.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:05.160]   What is observed is that the total amount of blood
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.780]   that the heart can pump with each beat
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:10.020]   is actually increased, peripheral blood flow increases
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.940]   and our ability to maintain cognition,
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:14.960]   to think clearly under conditions of stress increases.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.500]   And again, the only manipulation here is a tutorial
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.100]   about how stress can be enhancing,
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:22.540]   which is essentially what I'm telling you right now.
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.400]   In fact, for those of you that perhaps have heard
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.460]   stress reduces testosterone levels,
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:29.900]   stress reduces estrogen levels, et cetera, that's true.
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:32.720]   It is also true by the way, that when you are informed
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.500]   about how stress can be enhancing of performance,
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.100]   it becomes anabolic.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.740]   That's right, it actually can lead to deployment
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:42.820]   of androgens and estrogens, things that many,
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:45.740]   not all people desire to have increased or certainly desire
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.480]   to not have diminished below their normal baseline.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.340]   So there's a lot of false stories out there about stress.
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:54.240]   Not false because what you're hearing is wrong,
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.420]   because indeed chronic stress, chronically elevated cortisol
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:00.060]   can reduce testosterone, reduce estrogen, diminish sleep,
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:02.580]   diminish immunity, et cetera.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:06.480]   But it is also true that stress under conditions
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.400]   where one believes that stress can be enhancing,
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:13.300]   can be anabolic, it can be pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen,
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:17.220]   it can be pro-cortisol regulation in ways that allow you
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:20.460]   to focus your cognition and so on and so forth.
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.860]   Now that's exciting, but I do realize that for some people,
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:26.340]   it might be sufficiently vague to make you wonder,
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:29.360]   well, how do I know if I'm getting the right response
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.220]   from stress or the wrong response?
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.740]   And the simple answer there is the more that you can learn
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:37.380]   about how stress can enhance performance and the more
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.100]   that you place yourself into safe, I want to underscore it,
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:43.180]   safe yet stressful adaptive circumstances.
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:45.720]   These are going to be circumstances where you stand to learn
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.020]   or grow in some positive way, not circumstances
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:51.500]   where you stand to hurt yourself or others, of course.
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.760]   The more that you can place yourself into conditions
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.660]   of stress and then to cognitively just tell yourself,
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.980]   ah, this elevated heart rate, this quaking of my hands,
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:03.020]   this sweating, et cetera, this is my body mobilizing
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.380]   resources, and the more that you can tell yourself
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:07.960]   that that's actually affording you an advantage
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.300]   in being able to allocate your attention to specific things,
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:14.180]   maybe why you made an error and analyzing that,
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:16.100]   or maybe why you succeeded at something
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:18.060]   and thinking about the steps that led to that success.
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:21.480]   The more that you can link that back to the processes
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.260]   that are taking you in the directions that you do
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:25.320]   and don't want to go and thinking about them,
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.780]   because indeed that's what stress can allow you to do,
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:31.660]   the more that you are shifting your mind away from thinking
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:35.320]   about just the raw, uncomfortable sensations of stress,
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.160]   you're putting a cognitive appraisal
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:40.860]   on a physiological process, you are thinking about stress
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:43.580]   in a way that is changing what that stress is doing,
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:45.020]   and you're taking your brain and body
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:47.460]   from a negative state, just to put a little bit
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:49.700]   of subjective valence on it, negative, right?
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:52.660]   Nobody wants to have the bad stress response
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.240]   to a positive state.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.140]   And when you develop a stress-enhancing mindset,
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:58.860]   you not only are going to feel more comfortable
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:00.420]   under conditions of stress,
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:03.460]   but you are also developing the perfect tool
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.060]   to plug into the whole process
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:07.080]   of building up your growth mindset
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.280]   in a way that allows those two things,
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.620]   growth mindset and stress-enhancing mindset,
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.940]   to synergize and to dramatically improve performance
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:16.180]   in the short and long term.
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:18.340]   And that's not just a statement that I'm making,
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:20.120]   that's what the research tells us.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.840]   So let's take a look at that research.
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.260]   So now I'd like to shift our discussion
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:26.540]   to some very recent findings about growth mindset
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.740]   and how growth mindset combined
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:31.020]   with the stress-enhancing mindset
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:33.940]   can powerfully change outcomes for the better
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:38.380]   and can do so in a huge variety of real-world contexts.
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.700]   And the work that I'm referring to
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:42.380]   is the work of a person named David Yeager.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:43.800]   Dr. David Yeager is a professor
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.580]   at the University of Texas, Austin.
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:48.140]   He did his graduate work with Carol Dweck at Stanford,
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.780]   and he now has his own laboratory in Austin.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:53.340]   And both when he was a graduate student with Carol
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:57.020]   and in his own laboratory, he's been doing very impressive,
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:59.980]   large-scale studies, meaning many thousands of subjects,
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.380]   so that itself is important,
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:04.740]   and using subjects from diverse areas,
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:06.640]   rural, urban, et cetera,
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.780]   different levels of affluence, lack of affluence,
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:13.280]   and finding essentially that when students are taught
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:15.340]   about a growth mindset, what it is,
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:18.120]   how it's different than a fixed mindset,
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.500]   and when those same students are also taught
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:24.620]   about what a stress-enhancing mindset is
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:25.940]   and cultivating that,
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:29.260]   again, simply through informational tutorial,
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:30.900]   watching a video about growth mindset,
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:34.740]   watching a video about stress-enhancing mindsets,
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:39.740]   and then confronted with stress, confronted with tests,
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:43.920]   confronted with opportunities to embrace hard challenges
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.700]   or easier paths.
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:49.540]   Across the board, the results show up again and again
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.240]   as students who are taught about a growth mindset
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:56.200]   and are taught that stress is enhancing perform better.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.800]   Now, Yeager and colleagues have shown that
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.180]   across a huge number of different experiments.
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:02.880]   In fact, there's a paper published quite recently,
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:05.820]   this was about a year ago in July of 2022,
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:08.700]   in the journal Nature, so Apex Journal,
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:11.860]   published as a full article in Nature and Science
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:14.900]   and elsewhere, they have letters and shorter formats
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.560]   like reports, and then there are the articles
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.500]   which correspond to major, major findings.
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.160]   So they published the following results
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.300]   as an article in Nature in July of 2022.
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.660]   The title of the paper is
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.700]   A Synergistic Mindsets Intervention
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:30.300]   Protects Adolescents from Stress.
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:32.980]   And what I absolutely love about this paper
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:36.020]   is that it includes a lot of different kinds of experiments.
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:40.040]   So for instance, they looked at high school students
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:44.020]   who simply anticipated a stressful event
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:47.660]   and had been instructed on growth mindset
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:50.580]   or stress is enhancing mindset or both,
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:54.520]   or control conditions where they weren't informed
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.400]   of those mindsets, right?
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.120]   It's always important to have control experiments
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.720]   where you're getting the same amount of information,
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.540]   but it's not the same information.
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:05.860]   And what they found was that anticipatory stress, right?
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:09.140]   The stress that we feel in anticipation of something
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.820]   that we think is going to happen is reduced
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:14.380]   when we are educated about growth mindset
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:17.580]   and we are educated about a stress is enhancing mindset.
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.800]   And the basic takeaway from that experiment was,
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.520]   yes, indeed, being educated on what a growth mindset is
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.820]   and how it differs from a fixed mindset,
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:27.160]   which you now have been educated on,
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:30.820]   definitely buffers you against stress.
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:32.640]   In addition, being educated on how stress
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.180]   can enhance performance can buffer you
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:36.420]   against anticipatory stress.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:39.540]   But it is clearly the case that when one is educated
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:41.600]   on both of those things, growth mindset
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.660]   and stress is enhancing mindsets,
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:46.620]   that one observes the greatest buffering or offset
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:50.580]   of the stress response in ways that can improve performance.
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:53.860]   Now that is but one experiment of the six, yes,
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.860]   six experiments included in this single paper.
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:58.100]   Now I'm not going to go through each
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.780]   of those six experiments in detail.
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:01.980]   And just as a side note, I've invited Dr. David Yeager
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:04.220]   to be a guest on this podcast and he has agreed.
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:06.020]   So when he's a guest on this podcast,
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:07.940]   I'm sure he will detail all the intricacies
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:10.340]   of those experiments in order to inform us
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:11.940]   about exactly what was done and how,
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:14.100]   so that we can benefit from that information.
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:17.540]   But just by way of example, another experiment in this paper
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:20.180]   used what was called the Trier Social Stress Test.
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:22.220]   And the reason I'm going to highlight this a little bit
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.460]   is because I think it relates to a lot of things
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:27.340]   that many of us have experienced and that will experience
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:28.900]   that are considered stressful.
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:30.660]   And of course, we would all like ways
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:33.020]   to buffer ourselves against stress
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:37.340]   and or leverage that stress to improve our performance
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:39.360]   as well as adopt a growth mindset.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:42.640]   So the Trier Social Stress Test is a kind of standard mode
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.220]   of stressing people out in the laboratory
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:48.400]   or in the classroom where basically a subject comes in,
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.080]   you tell them to wait a little bit of time.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.920]   Then you measure their stress response at rest.
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.480]   You're looking at their heart rate, their blood pressure.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.160]   You might have them spit into a little tube
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.160]   and use that saliva to measure cortisol
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:04.720]   because that's how you measure cortisol.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.000]   Then you're going to tell them that they're going
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.960]   to prepare a speech for presentation
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.520]   in front of a small group of actual people.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.960]   Then they actually have to deliver that speech
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.720]   in front of that audience.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:18.340]   During that speech, sometimes the people who are observing it
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:22.340]   are giving feedback like frowns, crossed arms, et cetera.
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:25.300]   Then there's a pop quiz where they get a heart arithmetic
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.580]   test in front of that audience.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:28.940]   And when they get answers wrong,
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:30.860]   they're told they're wrong in front of that audience.
[01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:32.900]   This all might seem kind of playful and silly to you,
[01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:35.660]   but most people do not experience this as playful and silly.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:38.660]   Almost everybody who goes into one of these experiments
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.800]   as a subject feel some level of stress,
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.660]   especially those that don't like public speaking,
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.900]   especially those that don't see themselves
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:49.060]   as very proficient in arithmetic
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.520]   or that don't like to work out problems in real time
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.360]   in front of people.
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.860]   You can see how this would be stressful.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:56.740]   And all the while, measures of psychological
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:59.780]   and physiological reactivity are being measured.
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:00.800]   Peripheral blood flow,
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.180]   the thing we talked about earlier among those.
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:04.820]   What I just described is pretty extensive,
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:07.780]   but I provide all that as a backdrop
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:10.440]   so that you can understand what happened before,
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:14.360]   which was people were simply educated on growth mindset,
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.260]   how it differs from fixed mindset,
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:20.580]   and/or stress enhances performance mindset or not.
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:22.340]   So basically what we have here is a condition
[01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:25.360]   in which people are just getting information, right?
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.900]   There's no pill, there's no treadmill,
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:31.140]   there's no going home and doing a bunch of problem sets.
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:32.740]   And what they observe in this experiment
[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:35.180]   and all the other experiments contained within this
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:40.100]   quite massive paper is that the mere learning
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:43.460]   about growth mindset and stress as enhancing mindsets
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:47.140]   allows these students to shift their physiology,
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:49.360]   so enhanced peripheral blood flow,
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:53.220]   changes in hormone secretion like cortisol,
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:55.100]   and shifts in their psychology
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:57.260]   such that when they feel stressed,
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.580]   they start to see that and experience that
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.780]   as an opportunity for challenge
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:03.240]   and to lean into that challenge
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:06.620]   and where they are told that they got the wrong answer,
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:08.620]   where they are told that they are not performing well,
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:10.820]   they are able to think about that
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:12.780]   and to allocate their mental resources
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:15.260]   such that then they do start to perform better.
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:18.100]   And the major takeaway from this study
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:20.780]   is that across the board in all six experiments
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:23.700]   in imagined stress, in real stress, laboratory stress,
[01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:24.980]   actual classroom stress,
[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:28.700]   and in embracing future challenges,
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:30.860]   just the learning about what stress
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.620]   can enhance your performance mindset is
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:35.980]   allowed students to do just that.
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:38.180]   Now, another really interesting feature of this study
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:39.540]   put out by Yeager and colleagues
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:42.140]   was that the interventions were one time
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:45.820]   and relatively brief, or we could even say extremely brief,
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:47.940]   whereas a lot of previous experiments
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:50.860]   had looked at growth mindset interventions
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:54.840]   that were on the order of four to six to eight tutorials
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:58.180]   lasting anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour each.
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:02.020]   This experiment employed just one 30-minute intervention.
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:04.360]   So when I heard about these results and read the paper,
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.340]   I got very excited.
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:09.220]   I wanted to know what is this magic intervention exactly,
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:11.100]   and I'm sure you're thinking the same.
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:12.820]   So I contacted Dr. Yeager,
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:16.060]   and he was gracious enough to provide me some examples
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:18.100]   of what's contained within this tutorial
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.220]   so that I could give you those examples
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:22.220]   in real time during this episode.
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:24.020]   So basically the tutorial starts off
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.940]   with a question about stress.
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:28.340]   It actually has a little field where you can fill in an
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:31.080]   answer to the following question.
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:33.400]   Can you recall a time when you experienced stress
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.020]   and what was that stress related to?
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.380]   And here I'm paraphrasing.
[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:38.660]   So what I put in response to this,
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:42.060]   'cause I actually filled out the form itself was
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:43.460]   when I was a postdoc,
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:46.380]   which by the way is the four to six year period of time
[01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:48.240]   that comes after your PhD training,
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:51.700]   I wrote when I was a postdoc,
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:55.080]   I was under a lot of competitive pressure
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.680]   to try and finish my projects.
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:59.420]   I was working under a diminished income,
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:01.700]   meaning I wasn't getting paid very much relative
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:04.300]   to the cost of living in the area I lived at the time.
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:08.620]   And I was also socially isolated from a lot of my friends
[01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:11.360]   that previously I had lived very close to.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.940]   That was a stressful time that I could recall.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:15.580]   In fact, no other time in my life, as I recall,
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:18.360]   was as stressful as being a postdoc,
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.580]   which is not to say that I didn't enjoy being a postdoc.
[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:22.480]   I delighted in doing the science I did
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.220]   and being surrounded by the people I was surrounded by,
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:26.700]   but it was very, very stressful
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.300]   for those and additional reasons.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:31.340]   So that's how this tutorial starts off.
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:34.780]   And I believe that the reason that they asked that question
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:36.340]   at the beginning of the tutorial is to kind of
[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:38.460]   cue up cognitive mechanisms
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:41.300]   that surround one's own understanding of stress.
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:44.580]   And then as you click through the tutorial,
[01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:46.940]   it starts to explain of all things,
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.620]   neuroscience and neuroplasticity.
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:51.740]   It says research from neuroscience tells us
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:54.940]   that through effort, our brain can change.
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:57.100]   It can form new connections that we call synapses.
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.340]   So of course I was delighted to see all that information.
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:01.840]   I'm very familiar with that type of information.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:03.200]   It also says things like,
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.160]   and here I'm reading directly from the tutorial,
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:06.800]   difficulty, struggle, and frustration
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:07.820]   when you're learning something
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:10.120]   are not signs that you've reached your limits.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.540]   They're signs that you're expanding your limits.
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:15.560]   Okay, then you go to the next field and it says,
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.380]   let's hear from a scientist.
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.920]   Uri Treisman is one of the top calculus professors.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:23.160]   Here's what he tells his students on the first day of class,
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.120]   quote, everyone in this class will struggle.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.260]   No matter who you are,
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:27.840]   questions are going to be flying at you
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.080]   that you cannot answer.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.980]   And when that happens, you're going to experience stress.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:33.660]   And if you don't understand that stress,
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:35.720]   you'll think it means, oh no, I don't belong here.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:38.060]   But in fact, that stress is an indicator
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.120]   that your understanding is deepening.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.000]   It's not a sign that you're not learning.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.420]   It's a sign that you are learning.
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:46.860]   Okay, so I could read this entire tutorial for you,
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:48.620]   but that would take up far too much of our time.
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:50.120]   But I think you get the essence of it,
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:52.620]   which is that with each slide within the tutorial,
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:56.120]   you're being told that the thing that you're experiencing
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:58.920]   that could potentially feel negative
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:02.720]   because it means negative things, you're not learning,
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:05.400]   you're suffering, you're suffering health-wise,
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:08.660]   you're suffering performance-wise is reappraised.
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:12.720]   It's telling you, no, the frustration, the agitation,
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.160]   the thought that you're not capable
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.520]   and you're not capable of getting better,
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.000]   it's actually the opposite.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.300]   So what this tutorial really is
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.720]   is it's an information-based tutorial.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.760]   It tells you something about the brain's capacity to change.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.720]   It gives you some true, by the way,
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.300]   mechanistic information about how synapses can change
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:33.480]   and brain circuits can change because indeed they can.
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:38.180]   And it's telling you that the negative somatic, bodily,
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:42.380]   and cognitive thought-based experiences of stress,
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:45.760]   that those represent you getting better.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.520]   That's simply what it is.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:52.180]   And despite it being simple in its specific message,
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:55.000]   that message turns out to be incredibly powerful.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.840]   How can we say that it's truly powerful?
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:59.760]   Well, we could turn to essentially any page in this study
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.480]   that Yeager and colleagues did
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.800]   and see that, for instance, the intervention,
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:05.080]   again, this is the combination
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:06.640]   of learning about growth mindset
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.480]   and learning that stress can be performance-enhancing,
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:15.480]   led to 40% improvement in self-regard.
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:18.240]   So self-regard is something that can be measured.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.640]   We can have very negative or very positive self-regard,
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.760]   40% improvements in self-regard.
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:27.760]   There was a 14% improvement in passing of courses
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.600]   that were of the particularly challenging type.
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.760]   And there was also a significant improvement
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:35.260]   in passing of courses that were less challenging.
[01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:36.100]   In addition to that,
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:39.320]   people who watched and engaged in this 30-minute tutorial
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:42.880]   also took on additional hard challenges in the future
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:45.440]   long after the intervention had ceased.
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.920]   Now, there are a number of other features
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.280]   of the David Yeager work
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:50.640]   that I think are especially important to consider,
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.220]   but rather than going to the specifics of those experiments,
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:55.800]   I'm going to frame them in the context
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.840]   of some very specific tools
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:00.660]   that I've spelled out for sake of this episode,
[01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:02.620]   based on the scientific literature,
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:06.680]   that you can use in order to build a growth mindset
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.040]   and in order to build
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.240]   the stress-enhances performance mindset.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:11.160]   Now, in some sense,
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.720]   all of our discussion during this episode up until now
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:16.600]   has served as a tutorial about growth mindset
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.000]   and about stress-enhances performance
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.860]   and how those two things can be combined
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:23.920]   in order to get a synergistic positive effect.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.020]   Nonetheless, I do think that it's useful,
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:28.720]   especially when thinking about cognitive tools,
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:33.240]   which are often less concrete and clear to people
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.280]   how they can implement them compared to, say,
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.680]   exercise tools like, you know,
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.260]   get 200 minutes of zone two cardio per week,
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.580]   or get six sets of resistance exercise
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:43.980]   per major muscle group per week, et cetera.
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:47.180]   All of that stuff in the physical domain is very concrete,
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:50.940]   whereas stuff that relates to tools in the cognitive domain
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:53.420]   sometimes can feel a little bit abstract.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:54.700]   So for that reason,
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:56.120]   I'm just going to take a couple of minutes
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.260]   and list off some of the key elements
[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:00.280]   to building up a growth mindset
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:02.320]   and a stress-enhances performance mindset
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.700]   that are gleaned from the literature
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:06.860]   that I've talked about now and related literature.
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:10.100]   The first tool is that whenever possible,
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:12.440]   if both the teacher and the student
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.940]   can adopt a growth mindset
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:16.160]   and a stress-enhances performance mindset,
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:18.220]   that's the best case scenario.
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:19.480]   This has been shown in the classroom,
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:21.460]   and it's been shown in other contexts as well.
[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:23.540]   And again, it simply means
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:25.600]   learning about what growth mindset is
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.740]   and how it differs from fixed mindset.
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:30.780]   It also ideally means
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:33.100]   learning how stress can enhance performance.
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:35.780]   Now, if that means spending some time
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:36.860]   with the discussion that we had
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:40.320]   around Dr. Aliyah Crumb's data, that would be great.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.060]   If it also means just thinking about the stress response
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:46.060]   and understanding that that stress response indeed
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.600]   is mobilizing resources,
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.220]   it's focusing your vision more narrowly, right?
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.780]   You sort of lose the forest through the trees,
[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:55.780]   and yet that allows you to really analyze carefully
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:58.860]   whatever it is that you choose to focus your attention on.
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:01.560]   Well, then that's going to be performance-enhancing.
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:03.500]   Again, these tools are purely cognitive,
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.500]   but they are well supported by the data.
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.060]   And the data also tell us that
[01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:09.880]   when teachers and students both adopt this mindset,
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.380]   the teachers are viewing the students
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:13.480]   as less fixed in their abilities,
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:15.140]   and the students are viewing themselves
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:16.980]   as less fixed in their abilities.
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:19.160]   The next tool, which is a really fundamental one
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.420]   to everything we're talking about,
[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:22.660]   was actually mentioned at the beginning of the episode,
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:25.780]   which is whenever giving praise
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:29.680]   or giving feedback of any kind to others or to yourself,
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:32.520]   perhaps even especially to yourself,
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:36.980]   make the effort to make that feedback about verbs,
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:38.920]   not labels, okay?
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:43.260]   To really think about praising or in some cases,
[01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:45.780]   maybe giving feedback about how effort
[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:46.620]   could have been better.
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:49.840]   But ideally you're saying great effort.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:52.920]   It was great that when you missed that shot on goal,
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:55.360]   that you ran back to your side of the field.
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:58.720]   It was great that when you didn't perform well
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:00.360]   on that math exam,
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:03.140]   that you went back to those problem sets
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:05.120]   and that you conversed with other students
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:07.300]   about why they had performed a certain way,
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:08.500]   and you really dug through it
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.880]   and figured out why you got things wrong.
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:12.620]   Now, a key aspect of this tool
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:14.960]   of focusing on verbs, not labels,
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:17.460]   is that it is especially important to do this
[01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:19.020]   when you've performed well.
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.140]   I talked about the reasons a little bit earlier,
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:23.460]   but I cannot emphasize this enough.
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:24.780]   When you've performed well,
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:27.260]   if you tell yourself or you tell somebody else
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:29.100]   that they're just a great athlete,
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:30.180]   they're just a great student,
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:31.980]   they're talented, they're brilliant,
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:32.820]   I promise you,
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:35.120]   you are undermining their future performance
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:38.480]   when they inevitably encounter challenge.
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.880]   If however, you give yourself or the other person feedback
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:43.500]   that's really grounded in effort, in persistence,
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.020]   in problem solving,
[01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:47.660]   you are absolutely going the right direction.
[01:29:47.660 --> 01:29:51.220]   Now, if you are going to give feedback about errors,
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:53.980]   either to yourself or to somebody else,
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:55.020]   the question really is,
[01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:57.100]   do you paint that with rose-colored glasses?
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.740]   Do you try and make it seem
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.700]   like the errors weren't that bad?
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:02.180]   That's not actually what we're talking about.
[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:03.880]   We're not talking about, what do they say?
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.260]   Putting lipstick on a pig?
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:09.300]   What we're talking about is looking at those errors
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:12.520]   and thinking about what led up to those errors
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:15.260]   and trying to put more of our cognitive attention
[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:18.160]   on the verbs, the things that led to those errors,
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.980]   and less of our attention
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.320]   on the emotions related to those errors.
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:25.180]   We really need to be analytic about those errors.
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:29.180]   And admittedly, we often need to take a day or two
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:30.100]   or maybe even longer
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:33.020]   before we can do that process effectively, right?
[01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:35.020]   Nothing that I've said thus far
[01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:36.460]   has said that we have to do all of this
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:38.180]   immediately after an error
[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:40.220]   or immediately after a poor performance.
[01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:42.660]   Sometimes we are so caught up in the emotional experience
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:45.540]   of having performed not as well as we would have liked
[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:46.720]   that there's simply no way
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:48.780]   that we can allocate our mental resources
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:50.100]   toward error analysis.
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:52.140]   Ideally we can, but oftentimes we can't.
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:55.180]   So we have to be, how do they say, gentle with ourselves
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:57.340]   and allow ourselves to move through that process
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:59.380]   and then get back to error analysis.
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:00.420]   That's absolutely key.
[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:02.900]   But we really want to focus on the verbs
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:04.940]   leading to those errors,
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:09.940]   not putting labels on the stupid, ridiculous, silly,
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:13.280]   fill in your blank with whatever negative label
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.980]   you might happen to come up with, okay?
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:19.980]   So verbs, verbs, verbs for analyzing why we did well
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:24.240]   and verbs, verbs, verbs for analyzing why we did poorly.
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:25.900]   Now you may have noticed that a few minutes ago
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:28.700]   I mentioned that oftentimes it's beneficial
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:31.400]   that when we make errors that we seek out others
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.340]   who either performed well, ideally,
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:36.840]   but also those who performed poorly
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:38.280]   in order to get some understanding
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:41.220]   as to why we did not perform as well as we wanted.
[01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:43.680]   And that raises another key tool.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:45.860]   There are a lot of data now to support the fact
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:48.900]   that one of the key ways to analyze our errors
[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:50.540]   is to get help.
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:53.100]   And this is one of the things that really differentiates
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:56.040]   the high performers from the low performers over time.
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:58.540]   And yes, there, I just used a label.
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:00.280]   I guess I could have said the high effort,
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:02.820]   which leads to performance people versus the low effort,
[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:04.360]   which leads to low performance people.
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.360]   But in any case, you get the idea.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.100]   People who perform well over time,
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:11.580]   regardless of labels that we place on them,
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.700]   tend to be people who seek help
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:16.640]   in order to understand why they didn't perform well.
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:20.080]   So this is a core component of not just trying
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:21.700]   and building a growth mindset,
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:23.860]   but really solidifying a growth mindset
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:26.280]   and a stress can enhance performance mindset.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.260]   So seek help from others in understanding
[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:30.400]   where you didn't perform as well as you like.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.320]   And I would say seek input from others
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:35.960]   as to what were the verbs that you think
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:37.880]   might have led to your heightened performance.
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:39.940]   Because we like to think that we have really good optics
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:41.040]   on why we did well.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.200]   Oh yeah, it was because I spent
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.940]   X number of hours practicing.
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:46.860]   But oftentimes those around us have additional perspectives
[01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:49.680]   that we can't access and learning about those perspectives
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.420]   of why we performed poorly,
[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:54.140]   but also why we performed well
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:56.840]   in the context of these verbs, not labels,
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.560]   is also tremendously beneficial.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.060]   The other thing that's clear from the literature
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:03.660]   on growth mindset and stress can enhance performance mindset
[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:06.220]   is that all of that stuff,
[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:08.660]   all those tutorials are most effective
[01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:13.100]   when both teachers and students embrace those mindsets.
[01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:15.020]   Now that's a wonderful situation
[01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:17.820]   if teachers and students are both available
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:19.220]   and willing to learn those mindsets.
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:21.880]   However, for many of us, we don't have a teacher,
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.860]   we don't have a mentor, we're doing all of this on our own.
[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:27.820]   And so what's fortunate is that there are also data
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:29.600]   in the literature showing that under conditions
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:32.840]   where either the teacher or the mentor is not there
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.660]   or is not embracing a growth mindset
[01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:37.300]   or stress enhances performance mindset,
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:40.060]   we actually can serve as our own teacher
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:41.900]   by using a simple tool.
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:45.360]   And the simple tool that was actually the same tool
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.500]   that was used in one of the Yeager studies
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:50.660]   is to take maybe a three by five card
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:53.180]   or an eight and a half by 11 sheet of paper
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:56.940]   and write out a letter as if you're writing a letter
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:58.780]   to the next person coming along,
[01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:00.140]   trying to get good at the thing
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:01.380]   that you're trying to get good at
[01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:03.900]   and explain to them what growth mindset is
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:06.640]   and how it differs from a fixed mindset.
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.340]   Explain to them what the stress
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:10.340]   enhances performance mindset is,
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:14.040]   how to adopt it and how it can amplify performance.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:17.180]   That simple exercise of writing a letter,
[01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:18.740]   which is essentially to oneself,
[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:19.980]   but you're sort of pretending
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:21.200]   that the letter is for somebody else,
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.380]   although I suppose you could
[01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:23.800]   and perhaps should give it to somebody else
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:24.940]   so they can benefit.
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:26.820]   That simple exercise has been shown
[01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:28.660]   to improve one's own performance
[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:30.800]   and to do so in dramatic ways,
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:35.300]   not just in the immediate term, but also in the future.
[01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:36.940]   Now, the final tool I'd like to share
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:38.540]   is one that I've come up with,
[01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:40.780]   but it's one that's really grounded
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:43.380]   in the neuroscience of neuroplasticity.
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:44.540]   And believe it or not,
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:47.940]   that's grounded in our understanding of exercise physiology.
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:50.320]   And that is to reframe this idea
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.340]   that the mind is like a muscle.
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:54.060]   I know we hear that over and over again.
[01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:55.580]   The mind is like a muscle.
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:58.080]   You exercise a muscle, it gets stronger.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.420]   You exercise your mind, you put it through some strain,
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:01.540]   and you can learn.
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:03.660]   Those statements are absolutely true,
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:06.540]   but the statement that the mind is like a muscle,
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:10.080]   that analogy falls short, I believe, in an important way
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.300]   that can lead a lot of people astray
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:14.160]   when they try and embrace growth mindset
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.900]   and the stress enhances performance mindset.
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:19.200]   And the reason I say that is the following.
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:24.020]   Exercise with weights or resistance training of any kind,
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:27.140]   whether or not it's body weight or machines or free weights,
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:29.520]   has an incredible property to it
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:31.920]   in that it increases blood flow
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.620]   to the muscles that we're training, right?
[01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:35.340]   This is something that really distinguishes
[01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:37.600]   resistance training from other forms of training,
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:39.860]   like long distance running.
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:42.560]   When we train our muscles with resistance,
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:46.460]   the blood flow into that muscle, the so-called pump,
[01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:49.140]   gives us a sort of a hint or a window
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:52.540]   of the growth of that muscle that is likely to occur
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.900]   if we allow that muscle to recover
[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:56.160]   after that resistance training.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.600]   In other words, resistance training provides us
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:01.540]   a kind of hint of the results we are likely to get.
[01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:05.160]   So when we hear the analogy that the mind is like a muscle,
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:08.540]   I think it falls short because when we strain
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:10.620]   to learn something with our mind,
[01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:12.720]   we don't actually get to feel what it is
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:16.860]   to perform much better as we are trying to learn that thing.
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:18.440]   Actually quite the contrary.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.260]   In fact, much of what we've been talking about today
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:22.840]   is the fact that the stress and strain
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:25.600]   and the disappointment that is so reflexively felt
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.300]   when we look at our diminished performance
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:29.900]   as we're trying to learn is actually the trigger
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:32.660]   for invoking the learning itself.
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:35.840]   So what I'm saying here is that it is not the case
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.800]   that when we go in to learn a language or a new skill
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:42.340]   or mathematics or something new,
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:45.200]   that for a moment we are fluent or partially fluent
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.380]   and then we lose that ability
[01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:49.620]   when we walk out of the classroom or the tutorial.
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:51.600]   That's what makes it different than the gym
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.620]   where you go and you lift weights
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:56.340]   or you use resistance training of any kind
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:57.800]   and you get this sort of window into,
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:59.480]   oh, this is what the muscle will feel like
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.060]   and look like when it's larger.
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:03.720]   So the mind is like a muscle analogy sort of works
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:06.280]   in the sense that if you properly stress a muscle
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.580]   using resistance training
[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:10.640]   and then you give it an adequate amount of time to recover,
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:13.900]   it indeed will get bigger and stronger.
[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:16.680]   And it is true that when you go in to try and learn something
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:18.640]   if you provide the adequate stress,
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.280]   which is hitting that point
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:22.000]   where you're not understanding the information
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.520]   it's not sinking in
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.600]   and you give yourself some time to recover,
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:28.660]   which requires sleep by the way,
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:31.960]   then you'll learn that new information over time.
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:33.840]   But where the mind is like a muscle analogy
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.120]   really falls away I believe
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.840]   is that the mind is not like a muscle
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:41.160]   because you don't actually get to experience the good growth
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.780]   that you're seeking as you're trying to learn it.
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:46.200]   Rather everything we've been talking about today
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:48.200]   is about learning how to experience
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:49.640]   the strain of trying to learn,
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:51.800]   the agitation of trying to learn
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:53.800]   as the learning process itself
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:56.120]   and understanding that while you might feel
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.380]   back on your heels a little or a lot during that process
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:01.620]   that you might and in fact very likely
[01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:05.000]   are going to experience all the category of things
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.540]   that go along with stress,
[01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:09.040]   elevated heart rate, frustration,
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:11.540]   maybe even a little headache or strain,
[01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:14.020]   difficulty maintaining focus, et cetera,
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:16.140]   that if you understand that all of those things
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:20.660]   are actually creating the specific neurochemical
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:23.660]   and neural circuit conditions to invoke learning,
[01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:26.000]   well then that learning will occur.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.260]   So in some ways a better analogy would be
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:30.960]   if it were the case that when you do resistance training
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.280]   that your muscles actually got smaller during the training
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:35.140]   and then rebounded to being even bigger
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:36.860]   than they were prior to the training,
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:38.520]   that would be the appropriate analogy
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:40.060]   for the mind is like a muscle.
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:42.200]   I say all this because yes,
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:45.100]   adopting a growth mindset is incredibly valuable.
[01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:47.640]   Adopting a stress can enhance performance mindset
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:48.780]   is incredibly valuable.
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:51.940]   And even more valuable is combining those two mindsets
[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:55.400]   because they do indeed improve performance synergistically.
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:59.300]   However, none of this process is expected to be reflexive
[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:01.780]   for most people, perhaps for anybody.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:03.980]   And the process of building up these mindsets
[01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:05.700]   involves another mindset,
[01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:07.660]   which is the one that umbrellas them all
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:10.780]   or gathers them all together and makes them really work,
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:13.900]   which is the idea that mindsets are indeed powerful,
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:15.660]   that they can have a real effect
[01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:18.180]   and that while they do take time to cultivate,
[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:20.140]   they can be cultivated.
[01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:21.300]   Thank you for joining me today
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:24.100]   for our discussion about growth mindset, what it is
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:26.240]   and how to cultivate a growth mindset,
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:29.300]   as well as the related stress can enhance performance
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:32.200]   mindset, which can also be cultivated.

[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:03.500]   Not so much on today's episode,
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:06.360]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.780]   we discuss supplements.
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:09.900]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:11.820]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:15.040]   for things like enhancing sleep, hormone support and focus.
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.560]   The Huberman Lab podcast has partnered
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.780]   with Momentous Supplements.
[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:19.500]   If you're interested in learning about the supplements
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.080]   discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.580]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:26.360]   so that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.540]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:31.060]   I am @hubermanlab on all social media platforms,
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:34.620]   so that's Instagram, Twitter, Threads, LinkedIn and Facebook.
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:35.860]   And on all of those platforms,
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:37.920]   I cover science and science-based tools,
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:39.460]   some of which overlaps with the content
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:40.600]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.460]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:44.420]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:45.740]   If you haven't already subscribed
[01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:47.140]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:49.100]   the Neural Network newsletter is a monthly newsletter.
[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:52.340]   It's completely zero cost and it provides podcast summaries
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:55.440]   and toolkits of things like neuroplasticity, sleep,
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:58.280]   deliberate cold exposure, exercise and so on.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.820]   To sign up for the Neural Network newsletter,

[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:06.980]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:08.700]   And again, it's completely zero cost.
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:11.220]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion,
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:13.740]   all about growth mindset and related mindsets
[01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:15.140]   for improving performance.
[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:17.340]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:19.180]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:21.760]   [upbeat music]
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.340]   (upbeat music)
