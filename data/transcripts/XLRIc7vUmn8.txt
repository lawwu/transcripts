[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   Tyler has a lot of objections to my book, The Case Against Education, but his central one comes down to this.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.040]   "Look, Brian, I hire people. You don't. Since then, I've done a little bit, but basically, I hire people. You don't.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:20.120]   And I will just tell you as a fact that I know after a couple of months whether a worker is good or not,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.080]   and therefore signaling really cannot be very important."
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.100]   End of story. Right? Pulling rank. So this is the argument that Tyler has right now.
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:36.720]   There's a few different responses to this. The one that is most pleasant and most flattering is to say,
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.760]   "All right, well, look, Tyler, you are one employer in a million. You're fantastic. You have incredible capabilities.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.760]   You can do this, but you're just one person. You're not involved in hiring most people,
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.720]   and most employers are nowhere near as good at you as spotting talent, and so you're still wrong."
