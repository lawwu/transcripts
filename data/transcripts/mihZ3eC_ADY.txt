[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   This next tip is one I use all the time.
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.080]   And it's that I try to book flights that will work,
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.840]   but maybe they're not ideal.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.200]   And then I set up alerts to try to find the flights
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.120]   I really want.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.320]   And that gives me the comfort of knowing
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.280]   that the trip is booked.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.160]   We don't have to wait until seven days before departure
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.000]   to know that we're actually going on this trip.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.520]   So maybe you really want to fly business class,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.120]   but you end up booking premium economy one way.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.720]   Maybe you really want direct flights,
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.960]   but you end up booking a flight to change planes
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.040]   in another city because that will work
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.080]   even if it's not ideal.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.400]   Maybe you really want to stay till Sunday,
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.760]   but you decide that you book a flight coming back Saturday
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.560]   because you found it.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.120]   We do this all the time.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.720]   And then most of these award search tools
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.440]   have the ability to set up alerts.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.960]   To take my previous example,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.680]   we booked two flights to Japan
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.760]   where me and one of my daughters is on one,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.480]   my wife and the other daughters on the other,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.440]   but we have 11 months until we're leaving.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.520]   So I went in and put alerts on both of those flights.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.960]   So if two seats open up on either of those flights,
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.640]   or if four seats open up on any other flight that day,
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.040]   we'll be able to easily cancel or change our flights
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.640]   so that we're all on the same flight.
