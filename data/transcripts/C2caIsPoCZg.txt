[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.540]   Faith and hope.
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.380]   Well, we need them both.
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.320]   But what exactly is the difference between them,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.020]   between faith and hope?
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.240]   It's a new question today,
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.180]   and it comes from Kelly in Chickamauga, Georgia.
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.860]   I think I said that right, Chickamauga, Georgia.
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.900]   Pastor John, I share your passion
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.420]   for the intentionality of words.
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.020]   I have a question about two words in scripture,
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.140]   namely faith and hope.
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.140]   First Peter 121 says that Christ's work
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.980]   was so that your faith and hope are in God.
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.540]   My initial understanding was that faith
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.920]   is rooted in past grace, namely the cross,
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.180]   but hope is rooted in future grace,
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.660]   specifically the revelation of Jesus in First Peter 113.
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.740]   However, Hebrews 11.1 and First Peter 121
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.580]   seem to define faith as something rooted in the future
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.700]   while also distinguishing it from hope.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.540]   So Pastor John, can you help me understand
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.860]   the distinction then between faith and hope?
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.500]   - Well, I'm glad Kelly shares my enthusiasm
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.980]   for the intentionality of words,
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.500]   'cause I really believe words are dumb things
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.100]   until a meaner gives them an intention.
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.740]   So that's a good way to ask the question.
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.260]   Oh my goodness, there are few things I think about
[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.140]   more than the nature of faith and hope
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.460]   and how they relate to each other in the Christian life.
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.540]   So this is right in my present wheelhouse.
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.100]   I love thinking about this.
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.300]   So here's my understanding of the similarity
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.820]   and difference between biblical faith and biblical hope.
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.460]   And that's really important to say biblical
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.620]   'cause the world has all kinds of meanings
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.780]   that they give to faith and hope.
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.900]   And I just wanna say, what does the Bible mean
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.940]   by saving faith and hope?
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.340]   Hope as it is used in the Bible
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.300]   for the distinctive experience of Christian hope
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.300]   is always a confidence concerning the future.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.620]   It's a confidence, not a finger crossing wish.
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.620]   So that separates the word, the Christian hope
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.340]   from most other uses of hope in the English language.
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.340]   Romans 5, 5 says, "Hope does not put to shame."
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.700]   It is rock solid, sure, and you can be confident.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.380]   That's Christian hope.
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.580]   And it's always future oriented.
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.860]   So a key text would be Romans 8, 24.
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.340]   "For in this hope, we were saved.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.100]   Now hope that is seen is not hope
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.460]   for who hopes for what he sees.
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.220]   But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait."
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.700]   There's a keyword, "We wait for it with patience."
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.700]   So when we say that hope does not see what it hopes for,
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.140]   the reason it doesn't see it
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.420]   is because it hasn't happened yet, it's future.
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.340]   We wait for it with patience.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.180]   So that's the distinctive mark of hope.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.780]   It is always future oriented
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.980]   and consists in a firm confidence
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.380]   of what we are hoping for, not just a wish.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.380]   Now, faith, on the other hand, is the bigger concept.
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:31.180]   It includes everything that we say biblically about hope,
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.980]   but it is more.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.300]   Now, that probably is gonna surprise a lot of people.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.620]   And it's a risky statement
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.620]   that faith includes everything we can say about hope
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.900]   is in faith, but that it's more.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.420]   But I think that's a true statement.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.260]   I think it's fair to say that biblical hope
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.420]   is biblical faith in the future tense.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.780]   If you are focusing on faith
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.340]   as faith that something will happen in the future,
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.700]   it is virtually the same as biblical hope.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.980]   But faith involves more than confidence
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.500]   that something which God has promised
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.620]   will happen in the future.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.620]   It is that.
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.780]   That's why I say hope is in faith.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.420]   It's part of what faith is.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.260]   It's more.
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.900]   The main distinction between Christian faith
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.900]   and Christian hope is that faith is in a substantial way
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.620]   a trusting relationship with a person.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.140]   Faith says to Christ, "I trust you."
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.860]   Not just your promises, you, person.
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.660]   You are a reliable person.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.300]   You are a trustworthy person.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.260]   Now that trust may sometimes, often, be future-oriented.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.180]   We may mean in that moment,
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.020]   "I trust you to keep your word
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.460]   "about this afternoon taking care of me."
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.620]   That's faith and it's hope.
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.260]   But in a specific moment,
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.340]   that trust doesn't have to mean something future-oriented.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.180]   It might mean that Christ has just said this,
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.140]   "I died for you 2,000 years ago.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.940]   "I bore your sins, John Piper, 2,000 years ago.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.940]   "I absorbed my father's wrath for you 2,000 years ago."
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.860]   And I, or you listening to that,
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.100]   look him in the eye and say, "I believe you.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.900]   "I believe you.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.420]   "I trust you."
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.980]   Meaning that what you have just said about the past,
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.900]   I believe.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.140]   Hope doesn't say that.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.940]   That's not what hope is.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.500]   Now, of course, that has massive implications
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.820]   for future life, right?
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.180]   But faith isn't only future-oriented.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.060]   It is person-oriented in a significant way.
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.940]   And the mark of the relationship with the person is trust,
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.020]   a receiving, treasuring trust.
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.220]   But beyond this distinction,
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.220]   the Bible presents hope in God and faith in God
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.740]   in ways that are scarcely distinguishable.
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.740]   For example, when Psalm 42 says, "Hope in God."
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.780]   I have leaned on this in my discouraged time so many times.
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.540]   "Hope in God, John Piper, for you shall again praise Him,
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.860]   "your help and your God."
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.620]   Now, that act, what the Psalm is calling me to do,
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.620]   that act of hoping in God in the midst of my trouble
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.940]   is hardly distinguishable from trusting God.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.460]   Hope in that Psalm is virtually, I would argue,
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.860]   virtually identical to faith in God
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.700]   as it relates to the future.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:41.060]   Now, Hebrews 11, one is the place where we see
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.940]   this interweaving of faith and hope
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.620]   as close as they get, perhaps.
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.660]   It says, "Now, faith is the substance
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:57.220]   "of things hoped for."
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.220]   And yes, I do think substance rather than assurance
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.780]   is the most helpful, accurate translation.
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.500]   And that's another podcast.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.340]   To give a reason for why that is
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.300]   and how the word "hepastasis" is used elsewhere in Hebrew,
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.140]   that's another issue,
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.100]   but just gonna have to go with it for now.
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.060]   I think that's the right translation,
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.700]   and here's what I think it means.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:26.420]   It speaks of things hoped for.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.260]   In other words, there's a reality in the future
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.660]   that God has promised and in some measure
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.820]   has revealed to us as precious,
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.580]   worth living for, worth dying for.
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.500]   And we are hoping to obtain it.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.500]   That is, we have strong confidence
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.180]   that God will grant us this great blessing
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.620]   of experiencing fully what we are now hoping for
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.780]   in the future.
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.780]   And now Hebrews 11, one says that the substance
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.980]   of that future thing, thing hoped for,
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.780]   that future reward or blessing,
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:16.780]   some substantial essential element of it
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:22.940]   is experienced now in what he calls faith.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:29.700]   Faith is the experience, the experience of that substance,
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.780]   the substance of that future reality,
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.780]   known, believed, tasted, cherished now.
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.100]   So let me illustrate that with Hebrews 12, two.
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.860]   The writer says that Jesus,
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.620]   for the joy that was set before him,
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.300]   endured the cross, despising the shame.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.820]   So God has assured Jesus
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.940]   that on the other side of the cross,
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.860]   on the other side of suffering and death,
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.860]   there will be for you a great joy
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.620]   that you will inherit.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.460]   He could see it.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.460]   Just over the horizon.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.940]   And he hoped for it.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.380]   And in that sense, it was one of those,
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.460]   Hebrews 11, one, things hoped for.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.060]   And I would argue that in the garden of Gethsemane
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.500]   and even on the cross, Jesus was sustained.
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.300]   It says he endured.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.300]   He was sustained by tasting already
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.540]   the substance of that thing hoped for.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.660]   He tasted something of that future joy
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.580]   that was set before him.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.580]   And Hebrews 11, one calls that experience faith.
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.820]   So I would say in Hebrews 11, one,
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.740]   it is virtually impossible
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.740]   to completely distinguish faith and hope.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.620]   The one is part of the other.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:12.500]   Maybe one last text to show how close faith and hope are
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.380]   in the New Testament.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.500]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5, 7,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.300]   "We know that while we are at home in the body,
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.140]   "we are away from the Lord."
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:25.980]   We can't see him.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.220]   He's in heaven, we're on earth.
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.460]   "We're away from the Lord.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.220]   "For we walk by faith, not by sight."
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:40.100]   So one dimension or element of faith
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:45.100]   is that it embraces as real things it can't see,
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.260]   like the risen Lord Jesus.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.180]   And Paul says, "We are away from the Lord."
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.780]   He's in heaven, we're on earth.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.980]   We can't see him, but though we can't see him,
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.900]   we love him, we trust him,
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.980]   meaning we walk by faith, not sight.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:10.140]   But that does not mean that when we do see him
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.540]   face to face at the second coming,
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.300]   we won't walk by faith anymore.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:21.020]   Only one dimension of faith is replaced by sight.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.540]   Not every dimension of faith is replaced by sight.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.220]   We will still trust him in heaven.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.220]   We will still feed on him as the living bread in heaven.
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.700]   And the same can be said of hope.
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.940]   We walk by hope and not by sight.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:42.660]   And yet when sight is finally gained,
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.500]   not all hope will disappear.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.740]   Heaven will forever be a place of faith
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.940]   and a place of hope
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.860]   because there will always be a future in heaven.
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.780]   A future to hope for.
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.100]   And there will always be Christ to trust.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.420]   He will always be the feast of our hearts.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.500]   So in summary then,
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.500]   hope is faith in the future tense.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.660]   And everything that can be said about hope biblically
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.540]   can be said of faith,
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.860]   but faith is more than hope
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.740]   because it involves trust in a person
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.060]   which may have a backward dimension
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.980]   as well as a forward dimension.

[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.900]   Well, Monday, we are back to look at 1 Peter 2.11
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.900]   and how the passions of the flesh wage war against the soul.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.540]   How do the flesh's passions threaten the soul?
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.860]   It's a super important discussion
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.780]   with a lot of implications for, well,
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.180]   every human being on earth, quite frankly.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.980]   We'll see you back here on Monday for that.
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.020]   Have a great weekend.
