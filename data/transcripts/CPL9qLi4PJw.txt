[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040]   As we think this week about recovering a biblical worldview, there is a desperate need to do
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.700]   just that.
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.860]   We as Christians would like to think that Christians in general, certainly evangelical
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.240]   Christians have a biblical worldview, but that's not the case.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.240]   In fact, I was reading a survey recently that said about 30 percent of Christians confessing,
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.100]   professing Christians, about 30 to 40 percent of them have a biblical worldview.
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.200]   I'm not sure what it means to be a Christian without a biblical worldview.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.640]   It may mean that you're only a Christian in name, or it may mean you're a rather infantile
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.140]   Christian because the biblical worldview is what you come to when you study the Word of
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.140]   God.
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.700]   So we could understand it if there was a new believer who hadn't really gone through the
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.680]   Word of God to have a fully-orbed understanding of God's revelation so that he would be able
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.780]   to interpret everything in the world in a biblical fashion.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.380]   But to be a Christian, to declare yourself a Christian and to reject the notion of a
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:25.040]   biblical worldview would be absolute contradiction in terms.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.040]   That's the point.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.040]   It's not the case.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.180]   The point of what contributes to the absence of a Christian worldview among professing
[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.340]   Christians is that there are so many in leadership who don't have a Christian worldview.
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.040]   And I mean leadership in some way in Christianity.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:50.480]   And where it shows up in particular is in the willingness of evangelical people, professing
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.940]   Christians to cooperate with the world.
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.340]   There's no fellowship between the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness.
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.140]   We're going to see that this morning.
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.420]   So we have to understand that to have a biblical worldview is to be completely set apart from
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.700]   the world, to make no alliances with the world, to have no cooperation with the world.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.440]   And I'm going to try to show you what the Word of God has to say about that.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.840]   I have a lot on my mind.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.960]   And a few things in my notes here.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.400]   So settle in and get your Bible ready, and let's look together at the Word of God.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:46.080]   I want to start by way of an introduction in 1 John, chapter 4, 1 John, chapter 4, with
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.520]   the great reality that God is perfect love.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.180]   God is perfect love.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.740]   In 1 John 4 and verse 7.
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.940]   It says, "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.760]   is born of God and knows God.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.760]   The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love."
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.840]   God is love.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.920]   God is perfect love, as He is perfect in every righteous element of His nature.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.640]   Down in verse 11, it again says, "God loves us, and if God so loves us."
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.500]   "We also ought to love one another."
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.540]   Then again down in verse 16, "We have come to know and have believed the love which God
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.560]   has for us."
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.380]   God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in Him.
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.360]   So I just want to establish that God is love.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.540]   He is perfect love.
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.540]   And in the Word of God, God's perfect love is revealed both in common grace and in redeeming
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.120]   grace.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.480]   But having said that God is love, I want to move to the opposite of that and also say
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:10.240]   - and this will be a little different in terms of how you receive it - that God is also capable
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.560]   of perfect hatred, perfect hatred necessarily.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.440]   If God is perfect love, then He must necessarily hate anything that harms or harms His people.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.580]   He must necessarily hate anything that harms His people.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.400]   If He is perfect love, then He must necessarily hate anything that harms His people.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:37.580]   And to make that clear biblically, Psalm 97:10 says, "Hate evil, you who love the Lord."
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.860]   If you want to be like God, you hate evil.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.000]   And then in Psalm 119, there are a number of passages that express this.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.340]   Verse 104, the psalmist says, "I love your law, therefore I hate every false word."
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.580]   Verse 113, "I love your law, I hate those who are double-minded."
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.200]   Verse 128, "I love your precepts, I hate every false way."
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:19.180]   Verse 163, "I hate and despise lies, I love your law."
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.080]   The more perfect your love, the more perfect your hatred.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.500]   You hate anything that opposes or threatens or harms the object of love.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.320]   So the perfect love of God for all that is holy and righteous and good means that God
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:42.600]   also perfectly hates everything that is unholy, unrighteous, and evil.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:51.180]   This is an established foundation for understanding the church's relationship to the world.
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.980]   Now you will recall in Proverbs.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.100]   As I said, I want to look at a lot of Scriptures this morning.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:04.300]   In Proverbs, chapter 6, familiar words that we all know and have read many times.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.560]   But let me remind you of them.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.560]   Verse 16 of Proverbs 6, "There are six things which the Lord hates."
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.500]   Just the footnote at this point, you don't hear a lot about the hate of God, do you?
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.700]   The hatred of God.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.880]   But there are six things which the Lord hates.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.880]   Verse 7, "Which are an abomination to Him: haughty eyes," which is an expression of
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:37.040]   pride, "a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans,
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.860]   feet that run rapidly to evil, a false witness who utters lies, and one who spreads strife
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.100]   among brothers."
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.780]   Those are evil intentions and evil expressions and evil actions.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.040]   And God hates them.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.300]   In Malachi, chapter 2, it says God hates divorce.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.200]   In Isaiah 61:8, it says God hates wickedness.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.120]   Jeremiah 44, it says God hates idolatry.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.420]   In Amos 5:21, God hates hypocrisy.
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:20.720]   And you find in Scripture a number of places, culminating in Revelation, that God hates
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.680]   false religion.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:33.220]   This is the foundation for understanding how we as the church relate to the world.
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.500]   God loves His own.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:44.240]   God loves all that is holy, just, and good, which is the description of His Word by the
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.640]   apostle Paul.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.580]   But God hates anything that opposes that.
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:03.520]   In 1 John 4, I want you to go back to chapter 2, 1 John 2.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:10.340]   Verse 15: "Do not love the world, nor the things in the world.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.260]   If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.000]   Notice the mutual exclusivity of that statement.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.480]   If you love the world, the love of the Father is not in you.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.100]   "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.520]   boastful pride of life is not from the Father, but is from the world.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:39.680]   The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who does the will of God lives
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.680]   forever."
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.100]   The contrast is stark.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.220]   There is exclusivity here.
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.820]   You can't love God and love the world.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.380]   "All that is in the world."
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:09:02.300]   "All that is in the world is evil, and the world is headed for destruction.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.160]   But he that does the will of God lives forever."
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.100]   The contrast is obvious.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:15.040]   Six times in those three verses, 15, 16, and 17, the world is mentioned.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.660]   What does it mean?
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.920]   The Greek word is kosmos , and it's the opposite word to chaos .
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.280]   Chaos means just that, chaos, disorder.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.320]   Kosmos means order.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.960]   It's a system.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.520]   And the Bible talks about the world basically in three dimensions.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:39.580]   There is the physical world, the created world, and the created world is obviously the work
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.560]   of God, and so we respect the creation.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.040]   The heavens declare the glory of God.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.500]   We know that, Psalm 19 and many other psalms.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.180]   So the physical world is something that we can love and appreciate.
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:58.220]   And we can appreciate and admire as the creation of God, even though marred by sin, His creation
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.860]   still comes through in its majesty and glory.
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.480]   The second use of the word "world" is for humanity.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.360]   Like John 3:16, "God so loved the world."
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.460]   He's not talking about the material world.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.760]   He's talking about the immaterial world.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:20.740]   He's talking about people, and we need to love people as God loves people.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.080]   But the way John uses the word here in verse 17, "I love you, O God, I love you, I love
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.040]   you," verses 15 to 17, is not the physical world.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.020]   It's not the human world.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:32.200]   It is the world system of evil.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:40.480]   It is the structure of the evil system that dominates human life.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:48.020]   Ephesians 2:1 through 3 describes it this way: "The course of this world according to
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.980]   the prince of the power of the air."
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:11:00.020]   The structure, the complexity of this world is under the control of the Spirit that works
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.660]   in the sons of disobedience.
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.940]   The Spirit who is the prince of the power of the air, this is Satan.
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:14.280]   So Satan runs the complex evil system that dominates a fallen world.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:20.040]   And Ephesians 2 says, "The people in that system are driven by the lust of the flesh
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.880]   and of the mind.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.880]   And they are not only children of disobedience, but they are children of wrath."
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:37.540]   This is the entire world viewed in its evil nature, headed for final judgment.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.900]   That is the world we hate.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.180]   We love the creation.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.800]   We love the people.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.660]   We hate the evil system.
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.920]   That's just a definitive starting point.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.160]   Why do we hate the world?
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.780]   First of all, because of what?
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.320]   We hate it because of what it is.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.380]   What is it?
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:02.100]   It is full of the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the boastful pride of life, and
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:06.280]   it is not from the Father.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.740]   We hate it because of what it is.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.720]   It is the enemy of God.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.780]   It is the enemy of Christ.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.740]   It is the enemy of Scripture.
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.460]   It is the enemy of the truth.
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.020]   It is the enemy of the gospel.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.780]   It is the enemy of salvation.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.680]   It is the enemy of sanctification.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.680]   It is the enemy of the world.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.680]   It is the enemy of the world.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.680]   It is the enemy of the world.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.680]   It is the enemy of the world.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.680]   All of that.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:35.080]   We also hate the world not only because of what it is, but because of who we are.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.360]   We belong to the Father.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:47.800]   If you go back to verse 12, in verse 12 John tells us that we are children of God.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.560]   The fact that we are children is broken into three categories.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.580]   Some of us are spiritual fathers.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.660]   Some of us are spiritual young men who have known Him who is from the beginning.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.760]   Some of us are spiritual young men who have overcome the evil one.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.180]   And some of us are still spiritual children, but we all know the Father.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.440]   What does it mean to be a spiritual child?
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.740]   You know the Father.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.400]   You don't know much more than maybe the basics.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.000]   You're connected to God.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.540]   You know Him.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.880]   You become a spiritual young man when you know sound doctrine, and by the knowledge
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:22.480]   of sound doctrine you overcome the evil one, because the evil one operates in false doctrine.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.220]   You want to even go beyond that to become a spiritual father.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:32.100]   That's not just to know doctrine, but to know the God who is being revealed in the doctrine.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.900]   So there are levels of spiritual growth, but in every case we are all categorically described
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.380]   as the children of the Father.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.680]   And so we have no part in the world.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.760]   That is why it tells us if you love the world, the love of the Father is not in you.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.380]   If you love the Father, you can't love the complex of evil.
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:59.260]   So we hate the world because of what it is, because of who we are.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.580]   We hate the world, thirdly, because of what it does.
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:08.680]   It dominates people in inciting them to sin.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.300]   All that is in the world is not of the Father.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:17.340]   It just is a complex of temptation driven at the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:22.280]   eyes, and the pride of life.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.340]   And then finally, we hate the world because of where it's headed.
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:32.400]   Verse 17, "The world is passing away, also its lusts.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.440]   The one who does the will of God lives forever."
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:42.280]   The reason I wanted to start in 1 John, just as an introduction, is to have you understand
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:51.680]   the fact that the kingdom of God and the world are absolutely mutually exclusive.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.180]   Here are the words of our Lord.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:59.760]   The words of our Lord now in John 18:36, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.760]   If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would be fighting so that I would
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.660]   not be delivered over to the Jews.
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.940]   But as it is, My kingdom is not of this world."
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.260]   Again, the mutual exclusivity.
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:22.080]   You can't have the kingdom of God and the world in any alliance.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.440]   But in fact, the same is true of the two.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.440]   The two are not of the same world.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.440]   They are not of the same world.

[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.440]   They are not of the same world.

[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.440]   They are not of the same world.

[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.440]   They are not of the same world.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:04.100]   Verse 18, "Our Lord declares that upon the confession that Peter has made, He would
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:11.400]   build His church, and that His church would hold the keys to the kingdom of heaven, because
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:19.380]   the gospel is the key that unlocks the kingdom of heaven.
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.880]   Then He warned them that they should tell no one that He was the Messiah.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.440]   The time was not right.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:33.320]   God's timing was yet in the future to make that declaration."
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.900]   So this is the high point.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.940]   Then in verse 21 we read this: "From that time Jesus began to show His disciples that
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:46.460]   He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes,
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.720]   and be killed and be raised up on the third day."
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.440]   You have to try to imagine what a shock this is.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.260]   "Because they have just heard from heaven that Jesus is the Son of the living God and
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:05.820]   the long-awaited Messiah."
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:11.620]   And the expectation would be that the Messiah has come, and certainly you would cooperate
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.420]   with all the religious leaders.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:20.140]   You would want the Messiah to have access to the religious community at its broadest
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:25.440]   and highest level, and so the disciples would assume that somehow
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.620]   the Lord is going to make an alliance with the leadership of Israel, the religious leadership
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:36.260]   of Israel, become prominent among them, and take His prominent place in the temple and
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:42.440]   in the religion of Israel, and then bring deliverance from all their enemies and establish
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:49.420]   His glorious promised kingdom, as the prophets had said.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:55.440]   But no, Jesus says His relationship to the leaders of Israel.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:02.540]   The elders, chief priests and scribes, is going to be so antithetical, so hostile that
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.880]   they will kill Him.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:16.360]   So at the very outset, it is crystal clear that there is nothing in the most religious
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:25.440]   element of human society that necessarily adds anything to the purposes of God for His
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:30.100]   kingdom.
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:37.020]   I can't imagine that if we would have told this story about some evangelist who showed
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:43.840]   up in Jerusalem at that time, that he would not want to get the cooperation from all the
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.980]   religious leaders.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:53.920]   That's typically what evangelists through history have wanted to do in the modern era.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.440]   But at the very outset…
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:05.280]   As soon as Jesus has declared that He is the Messiah, He declares immediately that the
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.760]   religious establishment is going to kill Him.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.360]   Peter took Him aside, and he began to rebuke Him.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:22.500]   This is Peter going from the high point of his life to the stupidest point in his life
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.440]   in a few verses.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:30.220]   And now he's commanding the Lord.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:35.680]   He just declared that Jesus is the Son of the living God, the Messiah, and now He's
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:41.040]   going to tell him what He has to do.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.580]   So he begins to rebuke Him.
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:48.800]   And while rebuking Him, he makes this statement: "God forbid it, Lord!
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:55.440]   This shall never happen to You."
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.140]   "He turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind Me.'"
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.140]   What's the next word?
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.140]   "Satan."
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.320]   "How do you do that?
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:12.440]   How do you go from speaking for God to speaking for Satan in five verses?"
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:17.860]   "Get behind Me, Satan!
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:23.820]   He just said to Him, 'Your Father in heaven has revealed this to you.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.440]   You were speaking for God.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.220]   You were speaking for the devil.'"
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.500]   Why did he say that to him?
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:45.300]   Because Peter wanted the success of the messianic kingdom without the necessary suffering.
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:51.720]   Peter was happy to make some kind of a strategy, some kind of alliance with the religious leaders
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.440]   that wouldn't necessarily mean that Jesus had to be killed at all.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:02.300]   Jesus says, "Get behind Me, Satan."
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.940]   And here's the problem: "You're a stumbling block to Me, for you're not setting your mind
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.420]   on God's interests, but man's."
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.080]   You've crossed over.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:16.760]   You've crossed over from the kingdom of God to the kingdom of this world.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.180]   "Get behind Me, Satan."
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.940]   Very strong language.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.440]   Hupage .
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.440]   Fierce rebuke.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.440]   Fierce.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:35.100]   It's the very same word Jesus used when He dismissed Satan in his temptation in Matthew
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.300]   4:10.
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:47.900]   The temptation is to get the crown by some alliance with the darkness.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.280]   You've taken up Satan's cause.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.060]   You're in partnership with the devil.
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.440]   You are a scandalizer.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.820]   You're a stumbling stone.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:08.900]   You have gone from being a rock to becoming a stumbling stone in just a few moments.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:19.400]   And that is true of anyone who crosses the line to avoid the necessary suffering, the
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:25.440]   expected suffering in the establishment of the gospel.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.060]   And the church and the kingdom.
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:33.400]   You're not setting your mind on God's interests.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:40.360]   Same verb as Colossians 3, "Set your mind on things above and not on things on the earth."
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:47.180]   This is the worst rebuke imaginable for a loving disciple like Peter who just wants
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:54.600]   to help Jesus by avoiding suffering.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.440]   His intentions may be unimaginable.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.520]   His intentions may have been noble.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:05.600]   But the devil's way is to try to get Christians to think that the kingdom of light can advance
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:14.200]   by avoiding suffering, that the kingdom of light can advance by making concessions or
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.520]   finding compromises with the dark kingdom.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.800]   And Peter's sin has been incessantly repeated throughout all of church history.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.440]   Christians have been trying to get Christians to believe in the dark.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:33.860]   They've been trying to help Jesus build the kingdom by striking a deal with the devil.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:41.560]   Every effort to advance the kingdom by means of worldly schemes is just another of the
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:50.860]   same sin as Peter committed.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:55.440]   In very powerful words.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:05.020]   Paul shows the distinction in 2 Corinthians, chapter 2, verse 14.
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:10.000]   He says, "Thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ."
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.320]   He understands that the gospel will accomplish the purposes of God without any alliance with
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.820]   the world.
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:24.620]   It manifests through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.440]   We are a fragrant fragrance.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.120]   We are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.120]   who are perishing.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:36.000]   And then he says this, "To the one, an aroma of death to death; to the other, an aroma
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.720]   of life to life."
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.400]   Understand this, that preaching the gospel is for those who believe an aroma of life
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.920]   to life.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:52.120]   For those who do not believe, it is an aroma of death to death, and necessarily so.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.440]   There's no way to mitigate that.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:05.480]   We lose our lives for the gospel, and then in the end we win.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:12.260]   We lose our lives for the gospel, and then in the end we win.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.780]   We don't win now.
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:21.800]   Good intentions, even love for Christ, prompting efforts to advance His kingdom by political
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.440]   lobbying, by pragmatism.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:35.900]   By social change, by shallow gospel, by entertainment, by emotional manipulation, by tolerance of
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:45.940]   sin is to cross over into the kingdom of darkness and try to make an alliance.
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:51.640]   Our Lord's way is to stay on the side of the kingdom of light and understand that they
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.200]   will reject you.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.440]   Jesus said, "I will reject you."
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:03.820]   "They hated Me because I told them they were sinful," John 7.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:12.560]   If you want them to like you because you think that's a better way to reach them, then you
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:17.840]   don't tell people they're sinful.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:25.440]   That alliance with the devil is pretty common.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:33.220]   The Lord knew that the kingdom of light advances on the truth and only the truth with no alliance
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:39.980]   with the kingdom of darkness, and suffering is inevitable.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:45.320]   All who live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer what?
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.840]   Persecution.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:52.620]   The kingdom of light needs no help from the darkness.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.440]   The world and its corruption is on the way to destruction.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.440]   The world is not a place for judgment.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.000]   We don't court it.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.060]   We don't borrow its strategies.
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.220]   We don't adopt its ideas.
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:10.460]   Rather, we warn the world of judgment.
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:18.040]   I'm afraid evangelicals have become like Peter, offering a better way than bold, compassionate
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:25.440]   proclamation of the gospel that offends the sinner, terrifies the sinner.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:33.220]   Instead of that, they have tried to find a popular way of acceptance to avoid hostility,
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:43.800]   to avoid rejection, and to avoid persecution.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:55.440]   The apostles turned the world upside down with no help from it: no social action, no
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.860]   narrative strategy.
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:08.060]   The evil kingdom of darkness hates everything that God loves and loves everything He hates.
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:13.960]   It is no friend to the light.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:25.440]   Our evil rulers are dominated by lies, immorality, deception.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.340]   They are the creature rather than the Creator.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.760]   They will not submit to the truth.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.880]   They are under judgment.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:46.460]   They are described in Romans 1 as characterized by a reprobate mind.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:55.440]   Godless rulers, all of them throughout human history, are previews of the final antichrist.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:03.940]   truth, Christ; Satan, lies, antichrist, don't make a good alliance.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:11.300]   So what I'm trying to stress to you is this: a biblical worldview by definition necessarily
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:19.640]   is in opposition to the world.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.660]   There are so many ways to point this out to you.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.860]   I'm going to have to edit myself as I go a little bit.
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:35.060]   But listen to Paul, for example, in Ephesians, chapter 5, verse 5: "For this you know with
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:44.320]   certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man who is an idolater has an
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.440]   inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God."
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.620]   This is unregenerate people.
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:53.520]   They have no part in the kingdom of God.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:32:01.140]   "Therefore, let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.000]   of God comes on the sons of disobedience."
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.680]   There we are echoing what he said back in chapter 2, as I pointed out earlier.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:17.920]   "Therefore, do not be partakers with them, for you were formerly darkness, but now you
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.600]   are light in the Lord.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:27.560]   Walk as children of light in all goodness and righteousness and truth."
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:36.000]   The separation is crystal clear.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.440]   Now all of that is just to sort of lay the groundwork for a text of Scripture that I
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.220]   want you to look at with me.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:47.200]   It's 2 Corinthians, chapter 6.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.580]   And we're going to see this.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:57.820]   This definitive portion of Scripture, 2 Corinthians, chapter 6, verse 14.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:04.580]   Let me read the text down through verse 1 of chapter 7, 2 Corinthians 6:14.
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:08.140]   "Do not be bound together with unbelievers.
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:12.360]   For what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.820]   with darkness?
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:19.560]   Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.340]   What agreement has the temple of God with idols?
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:27.520]   For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said, 'I will dwell in them and walk
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:32.400]   among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.'
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:38.340]   Therefore come out from their midst and be separate, says the Lord, and do not touch
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:44.300]   what is unclean, and I will welcome you, and I will be a father to you, and you shall be
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:49.540]   sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty."
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:56.540]   The contrast here is profound.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:03.640]   You have a kingdom of righteousness, a kingdom of light, the kingdom of Christ, a kingdom
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:08.020]   of believers, the kingdom of God.
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:19.520]   Then you have, in opposition to that, lawlessness, darkness, Satan, unbelievers, and idols.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:28.840]   There is no possibility of those two working together in any kind of partnership, any kind
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:40.820]   of ministry, alliance, or fellowship, any kind of common cause.
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:47.580]   So let's just start in verse 14: "Do not be bound together with unbelievers."
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.500]   It doesn't mean you should divorce.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.000]   You're married to an unbeliever and you come to Christ.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.560]   First Corinthians 7 says if an unbeliever wants to stay, stay married.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:04.240]   It doesn't mean isolation, and I want to make that very clear.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.960]   So the words of our Lord speak to that in John, chapter 17.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.120]   And you know these words, but let me remind you of them.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:19.480]   John, chapter 17, verse 15.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:26.360]   "I do not ask you - " this is Jesus praying to the Father.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:34.620]   "I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one."
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.380]   So it's not isolation.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.840]   Keep them from the evil one.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:46.080]   They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.420]   Sanctify them in the truth.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.420]   Your Word is truth.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.460]   "As you sent Me into the world, I will sanctify them in the truth.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.460]   I will sanctify them in the world, but sanctify them by your truth."
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.460]   So we're not talking about isolation.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.460]   I don't want them out of the world.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.460]   I want them in the world.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.460]   Send them into the world, Father, but sanctify them by your truth.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.460]   So we're not talking about isolation.
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:56.460]   Paul even tells the Corinthians, "I don't want you to separate from sinners.
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.460]   I want you to separate from those who say they're believers, but are categorized by
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:58.460]   the same sins."
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.460]   I want you to separate from those who say they're believers, but are categorized by
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.460]   the same sins.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.460]   I want you to separate from those who say they're believers, but are categorized by
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.460]   the same sins.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.460]   I want you to separate from those who say they're believers, but are categorized by
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.460]   the same sins.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.460]   I want you to separate from those who say they're believers, but are categorized by
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.460]   the same sins.
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.460]   I want you to separate from those who say they're believers, but are categorized by
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.460]   the same sins.
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.900]   Paul even tells the Corinthians, "I don't want you to separate from sinners.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:17.360]   I want you to separate from those who say they're believers, but are categorized by
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:22.860]   the same sins.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.660]   Do not be bound together, yoked unequally."
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:32.100]   Now that prohibition, by the way, again from 2 Corinthians 6:14, "do not be bound together
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.440]   with unbelievers," is drawn from Deuteronomy 12.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.460]   Deuteronomy 22:10.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:41.560]   Deuteronomy 22:10 gives a prohibition, and here it is: "You shall not plow with an ox
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.560]   and a donkey."
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:52.940]   Now you have enough agrarian insight to know you can't pull a plow with an ox and a donkey,
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.700]   two completely different creatures.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:00.440]   And that is the illustration that is borrowed from the Old Testament to show the ridiculous
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.420]   nature of any alliance between a believer and a nonbeliever.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:17.000]   In the prophecy of Jeremiah - and I'm going to cover a lot of these Scriptures, but there
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.600]   are some I'm going to try to leave out, but it's hard because they're pertinent.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:32.680]   But in Jeremiah 2:5 we read this: "Thus says the Lord, 'What injustice did your fathers
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.400]   find in Me?
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.040]   They went far from Me, and walked after emptiness, and became empty.'
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.400]   They didn't say, 'Where is the Lord who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.840]   through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:53.720]   and of deep darkness, through a land that no one crossed and where no man dwelt?'
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:58.440]   I brought you into the fruitful land to eat its fruits and its good things, but you came
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.580]   and defiled My land and My inheritance; you made an abomination.'
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.380]   The priest didn't say, 'Where is the Lord?'
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.220]   'And those who handle the law didn't know Me.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:13.060]   The rulers transgressed against Me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal and walked after
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.740]   things that did not profit.
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:21.260]   Therefore I will contend with you,' declares the Lord, 'and with your sons I will contend,'"
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.920]   - with your sons' sons.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:28.320]   "For cross to the coatlands of Kittim and see, and send to Kedar, and observe closely,
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:34.360]   and see if there has been such a thing as this: Has a nation changed gods when they
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.620]   were not gods?
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:41.340]   But My people have changed their glory for that which does not profit."
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:45.600]   In other words, you switched from the true and living God to an idol.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.120]   "Be appalled, O heavens, at this!
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.940]   Shudder, be very desolate!"
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:58.880]   This calls for a reaction on the part of heaven, "For My people have committed two evils.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:04.340]   They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, to hew for themselves the waters of
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:08.920]   the earth, and they have made themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:13.460]   water."
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:20.040]   Going from God to an idol.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:29.180]   You can't link God to the world system in any spiritual enterprise.
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:34.320]   Satan bent on destroying the work of God.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.120]   Satan seeks to join the church.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.120]   We know that.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.120]   Our Lord said that.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.080]   An enemy would sow tares, right, in the field of wheat.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.440]   So you have the true believers and the enemy.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.700]   Satan sows tares.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.720]   Satan wants to join the church.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.840]   This is true.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.700]   Satan wants to join the church.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:59.160]   And Satan also wants to seduce the church to join the world.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.440]   We see that in the letters to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.440]   "And the Lord said, 'We will not be a church, but a church of the world.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.300]   We will be a church of the world.'"
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.300]   We see that in the letters to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:10.080]   Satan wants to join the church, so we have to face the fact that the church is made up
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.600]   of believers and unbelievers.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.880]   That is no surprise.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:19.920]   I know sometimes people ask me the question, "Why is the church the way it is?
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:26.840]   Isn't it rather embarrassing to God to have such confusion in Christianity that people
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.780]   don't even know what a true Christian is?"
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.560]   This is no surprise.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.280]   This is within the framework of God's divine will.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.640]   This is within the framework of God's divine intention, because it is Jesus who said in
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:43.340]   Matthew 7, "Many will say unto me, 'Lord, Lord, I did this, I did that,' and I'll say,
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:47.280]   'Depart from me, I never knew you, you workers of iniquity.'"
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:54.080]   And in Matthew 13, He gave all those parables about the mixed kingdom externally.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.440]   So Satan wants to join the church, and Satan wants the church to join the world.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.440]   That's his strategy.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.260]   Currently, the church has literally been sucked into the world.
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:09.620]   Into the world of critical race theory.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:14.220]   We all know that.
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:34.240]   Social justice, feminism, homosexuality, racism, all these things, all this collective vengeance,
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.900]   that has nothing to do with us.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:51.680]   In Ephesians 4, we are told to put away all anger, all wrath, all vengeance, all clamor,
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:42:00.700]   all evil speaking, and be tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ has forgiven
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:04.220]   you.
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:13.060]   The law of light has no role to play in bitterness, no role to play in racism, vengeance, the
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:21.360]   graceless philosophy of intersectionality, Me Too movement, feminism, spawned out of
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:32.860]   human philosophy for the sake of retaliation and money.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.200]   You can't have...
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:40.620]   You can't have the world, which hates God, hates Christ, hates the gospel, hates the
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:47.620]   family, hates moral purity.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:52.840]   You can't take up their cause.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:43:04.180]   Partnering with the world in efforts to placate their sense of retaliation against history,
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:14.380]   the world, is to hear from heaven, "Get behind Me, Satan."
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:20.200]   To join in common cause with the world to accomplish anything that advances the kingdom
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:25.020]   is pure folly.
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:34.160]   So what I'm saying is that a biblical worldview is necessarily exclusive.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.160]   It's not just about the world.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.160]   It's about the world as a whole.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:59.320]   Okay, don't be bound together with unbelievers.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:07.400]   And that's borrowed, I told you, that's borrowed from Deuteronomy 22:10, the ox and the donkey.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:15.560]   And that Old Testament analogy reminds us of the Old Testament prohibitions with regard
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.560]   to Israel and the surrounding nations.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:24.140]   So let's look at the past using that Deuteronomy 22:10.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.720]   The Deuteronomy passage is kind of a trigger to go to the past.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:35.320]   Listen to the instruction that God gave Israel, and we'll go back to the 23rd chapter of Exodus
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:49.760]   at the time of the giving of the law, Exodus 23 and verse 31.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:54.120]   This is God telling His people what He expects in terms of relationships to the nations.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.400]   "I will set up a covenant with the nations around them.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.360]   I will fix your boundary from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.600]   wilderness to the River Euphrates.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.720]   I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you will drive them out
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.880]   before you."
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.900]   Now that's about as exclusive as you can get.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:19.520]   You go into the land, and I'm going to give you those people, and you drive those people
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.940]   out.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.100]   You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods.
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:34.240]   They shall not live in your land, because they will make you sin against Me.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:39.720]   The separation was essential.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:48.000]   They will make you sin against Me.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.080]   In chapter - well, there's a number of places we could look.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:46:05.720]   But I'm thinking of chapter 34, verse 12: "Watch yourselves, that you make no covenant
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:11.580]   with the inhabitants of the land into which you're going, or it will become a snare in
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:12.580]   your midst.
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:19.460]   But rather, you are to tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, cut down their
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:24.060]   ashram, for you shall not worship any other god.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.060]   For the name of the Lord is Jealous, and the name of the Lord is Jealous.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.060]   And the name of the Lord is Jealous is a jealous god.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:31.180]   Otherwise, you might make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they would
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:37.340]   play the harlot with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and someone might invite you
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:44.940]   to eat of His sacrifice, and you might take some of His daughters for your sons, and His
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:50.040]   daughters might play the harlot with their gods and cause your sons also to play the
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:54.040]   harlot with their gods."
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.060]   You can't do that.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.840]   Make no covenant.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.440]   Make no alliance.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:06.660]   They will cause you to sin.
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:11.920]   In Deuteronomy, chapter 7, familiar words as that chapter opens: "When the Lord your
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:15.360]   God brings you" - and this is when they're on the edge of the land - "brings you into
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.960]   the land where you're entering to possess it, and clears away many nations before you,
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.020]   the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, Jebusites, and the Amorites.
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:25.020]   The Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, and the Amorites.
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.020]   The Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, and the Amorites.
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.840]   Seven nations greater and stronger than you.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:33.040]   And when the Lord your God delivers them before you and you defeat them, then you shall utterly
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:37.780]   destroy them."
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.640]   Amazing.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:45.560]   The presence of those idolatrous nations threatened the very existence of Israel.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:53.240]   "You shall make no covenant with them, show no favor to them; furthermore, you shall not
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.000]   intermarry with them.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.400]   You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor shall you take their daughters for
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:05.000]   your sons; for they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.760]   Then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you, and He will quickly destroy you.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:16.880]   But thus you shall do to them: you shall tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars,
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:21.400]   hew down their ashram, burn their graven images with fire."
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.980]   Verse 6 key: "For you are a holy nation.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.280]   You are a holy people to the Lord your God.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:30.800]   The Lord has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the people who
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.760]   are on the face of the earth."
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.640]   You are unique.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:46.800]   There can be absolutely no alliance with the world, none.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:53.960]   And God isolated Israel with their diet, with their clothing, with their calendar.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:49:03.360]   He didn't need the help of the culture to advance the kingdom.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.520]   That's the past.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:09.920]   Going back to 2 Corinthians 6, let's look at the present.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:18.140]   In verse 14, speaking present tense: "For what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness?
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.860]   What fellowship has light with darkness?
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:23.400]   What harmony has Christ with Belial?
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:23.940]   What has a believer in Christ with Belial?
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:27.160]   What has a believer in common with an unbeliever?
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.260]   Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols?"
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:33.480]   They're just mutually exclusive.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.400]   Five comparisons here.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:39.640]   What partnership have righteousness and lawlessness?
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.580]   That's looking at behavior.
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:44.500]   The behavior is distinct.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.300]   What partnership?
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.700]   Partnership.
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:53.920]   Metaxas, only used here, by the way.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:50:01.600]   The word to this was used to describe Peter's fishing business back in Luke 5.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.600]   What alliance?
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:12.720]   What do we do when we are tempted to have business with the world?
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:19.120]   You can't have a partnership with lawlessness and righteousness.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:23.900]   In fact, just thinking about 1 John for a minute.
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.660]   It's really powerful.
[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:33.100]   First John, chapter 3, verse 4: "Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness,
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.100]   and sin is lawlessness.
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:39.160]   You know that He appeared in order to take away sins, and in Him there is no sin.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:42.360]   No one who abides in Him sins.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:46.000]   No one who sins has seen Him or knows Him.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.640]   Little children, make sure no one deceives you.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:53.880]   The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:58.880]   The one who practices sin is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning.
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.760]   The Son of God appeared for this purpose to destroy the work of the devil.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:08.000]   No one who is born of God practices sin, because the seed abides in Him, and he cannot sin
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.580]   because he's born of God.
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:13.800]   By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:18.840]   Anyone who doesn't practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who doesn't love
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.840]   his brother."
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:23.860]   You can't have a common enterprise between the children of Satan.
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:28.100]   "And the children of God, between the righteous and the lawless."
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:33.380]   I don't care what the cause is.
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.260]   That partnership is impossible.
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:42.300]   The second comparison: "What fellowship has light with darkness?"
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.420]   What koinonia?
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:49.100]   Now we go from behavior to character or nature.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.840]   This is internal.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.840]   Light is a metaphor for truth.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:57.000]   Truth and virtue.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.300]   Darkness is a metaphor for deception and sin.
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:05.480]   You can't bring the children of light and the children of darkness together.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:10.700]   They have different behavior, and that's because they have different character.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:15.060]   In verse 15 he adds a third comparison: "What harmony has Christ with Belial?"
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:17.820]   That is a jarring statement, by the way.
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:22.380]   Belial is the ancient name for Satan, used twelve times in the Old Testament.
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.820]   It essentially means wicked.
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.920]   It has the overtones of worthless.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:36.500]   It is unthinkable that wicked, worthless Satan would be linked with Christ in any enterprise.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.500]   No harmony.
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:42.080]   A beautiful word in the Greek, symphonēsis , from which we get symphony.
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:49.560]   You can't have a symphony with the children of the devil and the children of God.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.800]   That is how the Lord wants us to work in the world.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:53:04.020]   But being sure that as we work in the world, we are recognizing the absolute incompatibility
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.280]   of any alliance with the enemy.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:11.420]   I don't care if it's political.
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:18.040]   I don't care if it's moral causes.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:23.780]   What has a believer in common with an unbeliever?
[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:30.800]   We're so different.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.060]   We live by faith.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.260]   We're believers.
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:35.300]   They live by sight.
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:36.480]   Our trust is in God.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.600]   Their trust is in themselves.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.500]   Our behavior is different.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.000]   Our character is different.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:53.760]   Our faith is placed in the Lord, and that's distinct from the world.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.760]   We don't trust in God.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.000]   They trust in the flesh.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.500]   We don't trust in politics.
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:01.140]   We don't trust in power.
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:05.880]   We trust in preaching and truth.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:12.140]   Then in verse 16 he adds, "And what agreement has the temple of God with idols?
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:13.520]   For you are the temple of God."
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.920]   This is a very dramatic statement also.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:22.480]   This would remind Jews who were familiar with the Old Testament of the eighth chapter of
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.740]   Ezekiel.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:30.380]   In the eighth chapter of Ezekiel, you have one of the most graphic illustrations of the
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:33.880]   decline of the people of Israel.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:39.100]   You can follow along if you're in Ezekiel at verse 4.
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:46.020]   This is a vision of abominations in Jerusalem.
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:48.240]   This is what Ezekiel sees in the vision.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:53.520]   Verse 4: "And behold, the glory of the Lord, the glory of the God of Israel was there,
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:56.020]   like the appearance which I saw in the plain.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.600]   And he said to me, 'Son of man, raise your eyes now toward the north.'
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:03.760]   So I raised my eyes toward the north, and behold, to the north of the altar gate was
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:06.480]   this idol of jealousy at the entrance."
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:14.200]   This is a vision of the temple, of the temple.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:20.520]   And in the entrance to the temple, in the vision, Ezekiel sees an idol.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.500]   "And he said to me, 'The Lord said to him, 'Son of man, raise your eyes now toward the
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:24.500]   north.'
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.720]   And he said to me, 'Son of man, do you see what they're doing, the great abominations
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:32.680]   which the house of Israel are committing here, so that I would be far from my sanctuary?
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:36.820]   They're sending me away.
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:39.260]   But yet you will still see greater abominations.'"
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:40.940]   There's an idol in the front entrance.
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:44.740]   "And so he brought me to the entrance of the court.
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:47.460]   And when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.780]   And he said to me, 'Son of man, now dig through the wall.'
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:52.280]   So I dug through the wall, and behold, an entrance.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.280]   And he said to me, 'Go in.'
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.540]   And I said, 'Go in and see the wicked abominations that are committed here.'
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:01.960]   And I entered and looked, and behold, every form of creeping things and beasts and detestable
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:07.200]   things with all the idols of the house of Israel were carved on the wall all around.'"
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:10.900]   Idols inside the court of the temple?
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:15.560]   "And standing in front of them were seventy elders of the house of Israel with Jahzaniah
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.600]   the son of Shaphan.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:22.640]   Standing among them, each man with his censer in his hand and the fragrance of the cloud
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.060]   of incense."
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:27.680]   Incense rising.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.980]   This is some kind of false worship.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:34.320]   "He said to me, 'Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.040]   committing in the dark?
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.580]   Each man in the room of his carved images?
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:40.240]   For they say, 'The Lord doesn't see us.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.300]   The Lord has forsaken us.'"
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:50.000]   Secret, cultic, who knows what things are being depicted inside the temple.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.840]   And verse 13, "He said to me, 'You'll yet see.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.200]   major abominations which they are committing.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:59.000]   And he brought Me to the entrance of the gate of the Lord's house which was toward the
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:09.720]   north, and behold, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz - " Idolatry all through
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:15.740]   the house of God, which is where this phrase is drawn.
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:19.040]   What agreement has the temple of God with idols?
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:23.720]   For you are the temple of God."
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:29.000]   The word "temple" here is naos in the Greek, and it refers to the Holy of Holies, the inner
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:35.080]   place where the presence of God was symbolized by the ark of the covenant.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:38.380]   We are the temple of God.
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.380]   We are the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:42.760]   We know that from 1 Corinthians.
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:47.980]   John 14:20, Jesus said, "I am in My Father."
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:48.980]   And
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:54.180]   "You in Me, and I in you."
[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:56.540]   We are the temple of God.
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:58:05.760]   We have no alliance with idols, no alliance.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:10.080]   Everything about the kingdom is distinct.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:16.200]   Everything about it is exclusive.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:18.920]   Can't be bound together with unbelievers.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:24.200]   Can't be bound together with the lawless, the unrighteous, those in the darkness with
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.720]   Satan.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:27.960]   There's no common cause.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:34.640]   The kingdom of God does not advance with help from the darkness.
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:42.720]   There's one more final note here, and that's a look at the future, and this is powerful.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:48.860]   Back to verse 16, we saw the past from verse 14 when we looked back at Deuteronomy.
[00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:50.800]   We saw the first two verses of Deuteronomy, and we saw the first two verses of Deuteronomy,
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:56.260]   and we saw the separation texts that Israel was to maintain in the past.
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:59:02.460]   We looked at the present and the present tense verbs in those five comparisons.
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:06.000]   And now we'll look at the future.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:13.420]   Verse 16, pick it up in the quote there in verse 16: "I will dwell in them and walk among
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:17.200]   them, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.800]   I just want to say this.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.000]   I want to stop there.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.180]   What is this talking about?
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:31.780]   "I will dwell with them and walk among them.
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:36.860]   I will be their God; they shall be My people."
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:45.760]   And down in verse 17, Paul adds, "I will welcome you," speaking for God.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:48.740]   Verse 18: "I will be a father to you.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:49.740]   I will be a son to you.
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:50.740]   I will be a son to you."
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:51.740]   I will be a son to you.
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:52.740]   I will be a son to you.
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:53.740]   I will be a son to you.
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:54.740]   I will be a son to you.
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:55.740]   I will be a son to you.
