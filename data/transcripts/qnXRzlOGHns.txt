[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.480]   Hey, Kyle, Sean here.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.080]   Hey, I really enjoyed your book, A World Without Email.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.800]   Appreciate that.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.000]   And really buying into the workflow concept,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.880]   it's very powerful.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.380]   I've got the calendaring piece down using Calendly.
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.720]   I've got the escalation workflow down.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.280]   And just wondering if you could do an episode on--
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.520]   or answer a question on what are the top 10 workflows
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.960]   that people should be focusing on to get people started.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.600]   I've got two down, and I'd love eight more.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.520]   Thanks, Cal.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.760]   Well, I will see your request for a count of workflows,
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.080]   and I will respond with a collection of categories
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.880]   for these workflows.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.720]   Because I think it's a more interesting way
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.400]   and a more generative way of thinking about this.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.640]   So quick preamble for those who want
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.240]   to know what we're talking about here, for those who did not yet
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.880]   read my book, A World Without Email.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.920]   In that book, I argue that the way we implement most
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.440]   of our work right now, most of the collaboration, coordination
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.480]   around our work right now in the office context,
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.160]   is through ad hoc back and forth unscheduled messages.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.360]   That's the hyperactive hive mind workflow.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.860]   And it's a disaster because you have
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.280]   to keep checking these inboxes to keep up
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.080]   with all these back and forth conversations.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.740]   That checking creates context shifts.
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.680]   Those context shifts are productivity poison.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.800]   So the big idea in that book is if you
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.320]   want to fix the problems of email overload,
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.280]   it's not about having better advice
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.480]   for dealing with your inbox.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.320]   It's not about better norms or subject lines or batching.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.280]   You have to actually take the things
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.400]   you do repeatedly in your work, what I call processes.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.720]   And for each, say here is the new workflow
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.700]   we will use to implement this process.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.080]   Here is our specific alternative to the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.720]   And when evaluating different alternatives
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.480]   for doing this collaboration, I think
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.400]   the metric you should be trying to minimize
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.200]   is the number of unscheduled messages
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.760]   that you will receive that requires your response.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.320]   So if you were trying to measure two different ways
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.920]   of implementing a given process, let's say
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.400]   responding to client questions or producing a weekly white
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.720]   paper, if you're trying to measure and weigh
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.920]   against each other various ways you might achieve and implement
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.480]   this collaboration, the thing you want to measure for both
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.960]   is how many unscheduled messages will this require
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.040]   me to see and respond to.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.360]   And the one that generates less, that's the right option.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.760]   OK, so that's what we mean by workflows.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.000]   The question asker here is saying,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.680]   what are 10 possible workflows you
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.920]   could use to replace the hyperactive hive
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.680]   mind for one of these processes?
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.360]   I'm going to instead give you three categories.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.820]   After that book came out and I've talked to a lot of people,
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.320]   I have found that most of the things I've encountered
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.000]   fall into one of three categories.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.320]   Category number one is deferral workflows.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.080]   So here the whole idea is you take
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.640]   what would normally in the hyperactive hive mind
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.000]   require a back and forth digital message conversation
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.640]   and you defer that conversation into another medium
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.320]   where it will not generate digital messages.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.600]   Office hours are an example of this.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.040]   So if you have a quick question, instead of just shooting me
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.160]   an email and we start a back and forth exchange
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.000]   about this thing, you wait till my next office hours.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   You're deferring the conversation to another time
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.520]   where it will happen without unscheduled messages being
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.400]   generated that require responses.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.440]   Another example of deferral is what you already mentioned,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.080]   which is calendar tools.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.320]   So again, now you're taking what would have been a back
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.200]   and forth conversation about when
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.380]   are we going to meet tomorrow, and you defer it to a tool.
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.540]   So instead of going back and forth, you go to a tool
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.600]   and select a time on that calendar.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.480]   Right off the bat, I want to emphasize
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.920]   that we are trying to optimize how many unscheduled messages
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.760]   require responses.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.520]   That's it.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.680]   I don't care if an alternative workflow takes more time.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.720]   I don't care if it's more of a pain.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.240]   I don't care if it required a lot of overhead to get set up.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.480]   Those are not the metrics that I think you should be optimizing.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.360]   What you should be optimizing is minimizing
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.720]   unscheduled messages that require you to respond.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.400]   So yes, it is a pain that you now
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   have to wait until tomorrow afternoon when my next office
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   hours are to talk to me.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.920]   Yes, that's a pain, but I'm not trying to minimize pain.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.760]   I'm trying to minimize unscheduled messages.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.120]   And if you just started that conversation with emails,
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.320]   it's going to generate a lot of unscheduled messages.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.400]   I know it's annoying when someone sends you
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   to a Calendly link.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.360]   You have that annoying hierarchical part
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.640]   of your social brain say, do they think they're better than me,
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.060]   and there's a little bit of bad social capital loss there.
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.080]   I don't care.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.720]   I'm not optimizing for that.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.280]   I'm optimizing for not having to do seven back and forth
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.480]   messages about when we're going to meet.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.200]   So I just want to use those first two examples
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.800]   to nail home this point.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.600]   Unscheduled messages that require responses
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.960]   are the productivity poison.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.040]   Be willing to do almost any other pain if it allows
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.400]   you to avoid that poison.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.920]   All right, category number two of these alternative workflows
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.360]   is automation.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.520]   So this is where this thing we do
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.120]   has the same steps happening in the same orders
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.080]   again and again.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.760]   If there's that much structure in a task,
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.800]   just figure out in advance your rules
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.880]   for how this thing executes so that we don't have
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.760]   to send each other messages.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.320]   The example I usually give is, here's
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.240]   a report that we have to produce every week.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.560]   Here's how we're going to do it.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.600]   Monday morning, I gather all the numbers out
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.040]   of the relevant dashboards.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.160]   I write a draft of that report.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160]   I put it in a Google Docs in a shared folder
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.480]   that you know about.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.320]   It will be there by close of business Monday.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.040]   That's what I agree to.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.640]   You then have all day Tuesday in the morning
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.680]   to look at it, make additions, make changes.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.320]   I have office hours at 2 o'clock on Tuesdays.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.400]   So if there's any questions that are complicated,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.000]   come to my office hours and we can figure it out together.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.600]   I then have told the designer that what
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.880]   he sees in that Google Doc at close of business Tuesday
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.600]   is our final version.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.400]   He takes that at some point Wednesday,
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.240]   puts it into the nice PDF format,
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.120]   uploads it into the content management system
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.000]   so that it will show up where it needs to be
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.520]   by the end of day on Wednesday.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.440]   We make that agreement together.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.360]   Once.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.000]   It's a pain, it's annoying, takes an afternoon.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.780]   But now that we've made that agreement,
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.060]   this report will be produced week after week
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.160]   with zero unscheduled messages that require response.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.520]   And that's all I care about.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.920]   All right, final category of these alternative workflows
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.880]   is what I think I usually call it externalization.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.820]   So you take the information and conversations
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.520]   about a project out of digital communication tools
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.320]   and put them somewhere else.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.880]   Most of these examples use something like a task board,
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.600]   Trello, Asana, Flow, a lot of these things.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.640]   But the task relevant to a given project
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.520]   or in a shared board where everyone can see it,
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.840]   they don't exist in chat transcripts in Slack,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.600]   they don't exist spread out among random messages
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.880]   in your crowded inbox.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.240]   They're isolated and clear with all of the associated
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.280]   material attached to them.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.160]   In some sort of system like a task board where it's clear
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.320]   and conversation about where are we,
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.560]   where do we need to go, who's working on what next
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.440]   and what do they need, you externalize that
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.660]   into let's say a well-structured status meeting
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.840]   that happens at certain times.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.480]   So those are three big categories that can each generate
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.020]   dozens of specific alternative workflows.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.920]   But again, they all share that same property.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.640]   How do we reduce the number of times
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.940]   I have to keep checking an inbox until I see
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.940]   an unscheduled message that requires my response?
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.240]   If you were minimizing that, you are maximizing
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.520]   how effective you're gonna be
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.560]   in almost any knowledge work job.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.880]   (upbeat music)
