[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:13.880]   Yeah, I would really love more exploration
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.680]   of the idea of action models.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.200]   And again, you can just fine tune a GPT-3 to do that,
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.120]   or you can just have a very elaborate prompt.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.680]   But can you have a model that can control the replit IDE,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.280]   or can use weights and biases to train its own model, whatever?
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.840]   Can it do interesting things in the world using tools?
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.920]   I think that would be my prompt.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.080]   It's like, make LLMs use tools.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.960]   I think there's so many ways to approach this.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.640]   I think it's probably the next sort of order of magnitude
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.480]   jump in usefulness is probably around this idea of tools.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.080]   I'll say one thing that I think is really coming
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.880]   that I think I would be exploring if I had more time
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.960]   is chat interfaces to everything.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.480]   It's kind of like what you're saying,
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.920]   but instead of arbitrary tools, I
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.720]   think making chat interfaces to your own tools,
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.440]   I think they've been enraging for my whole lifetime.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.280]   And so you think a chat interface is garbage.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.240]   But I actually think we might be at the point where--
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.280]   I wonder if the best way to use any tool in the next few years
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.680]   could just be just telling it in natural language what to do.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.800]   I even wonder with weights and biases.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.160]   It's like, make me a report that tells me about this.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.960]   It seems like we're maybe at the point
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.040]   where that could be actually valuable.
