[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   All right, so I promised ITs to have it tune up for a new piece of advice
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.440]   that if you work in an organization with other people, I said would be one of the
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.240]   single most effective things you could do to reduce emails in your inbox. So here it is. I call it
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:24.560]   docket clearing meetings. I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 209.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:34.400]   I'm here at my Deep Work HQ, joined by my producer, Jesse. Before we get at all into today's episode,
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:43.280]   a quick bit of house cleaning. Jesse and I want to hear from you about what's working with this show,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.120]   what's not, what you want to hear more of, what you want to hear less of. We're doing a version
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.520]   2.0 we're planning for the podcast, just to tighten up what works and maybe batten down what's not. So
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.960]   with that in mind, we created a quick online survey. Just go to the description of this podcast
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.880]   episode. There's a link, you click on it, answer a few questions. If you get a chance, it would be
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.520]   very useful for us. It's a way to help influence the future of this show. So we're serious about
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.880]   improving. So go to the description, click on that survey link, answer a few questions, and you will
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.120]   have our great appreciation. I think Jesse, what I'm going to do is have two text boxes on there.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.200]   One will be complaints about Jesse, and it'll be like this really big box or whatever. And then
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.800]   there'll be complaints about Cal, and it'll be a really small box. And then when you click on it,
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.560]   it'll be inactivated. Like it. Yeah, it'll just make me feel better. Sounds good. Forget the
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.480]   audience, forget the numbers. We know what this is all about, making Cal feel good. Speaking of good,
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.760]   we have a good episode. So what I'm doing here, Jesse, I'm theming both parts of the show today.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.800]   So we have part one, part two, part one of the show, we're focusing on work, but in particular,
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.880]   we're going to focus on email. I have a collection of questions about email. So all in the same
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.560]   theme, I will end part one with a habit tune up where I will be presenting a brand new piece of
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.760]   advice. It's something I began working on a little while ago. I've been testing it out,
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.080]   bouncing it off people, but I've never publicly revealed it before. I would argue it is one of
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.880]   the single most effective things you could do to reduce the number of emails in your inbox.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.240]   If you work in an organization with other people, one thing you could start doing tomorrow
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.560]   that will greatly reduce the number of emails. I'm looking forward to that.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.320]   Then part two of the episode, we will get philosophical. I have a call on a collection
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.360]   of questions all about how do I live a more meaningful, deliberate, deep life? People
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.360]   who are struggling with the question of being adrift, being unfocused and looking to have
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.840]   a more steady and clear direction to what they're trying to do with their life. So upfront part one,
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.920]   pragmatic email ending with a brand new piece of advice I'm excited about part two.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.000]   We get philosophical. Now, before we get into those two parts, though, I'd like to start
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.840]   the shows when possible, reacting to what's going on in the news. In particular, I have an article
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.040]   I want to talk about that we didn't really get around to talking on the last episode,
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.800]   but we should have because it's by me. So when I publish new things, especially new things in
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.400]   the New Yorker, I like to try to discuss them on the show in a little bit more depth, let you know
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   what I'm thinking, maybe give you some more angles on it. So a couple of weeks ago, I published my
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.280]   latest for the New Yorker. It's titled Tick Tock and the Fall of the Social Media Giants. If you
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.280]   are watching this episode instead of just listening. So if you're at YouTube dot com slash
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.320]   Cal Newport Media, you'll see the article on your screen as well. Now, why I thought it was important
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.000]   to talk about this topic is not that I haven't talked about it before on the show, but because
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.720]   of the opposite of that, I've talked about this topic a lot on the show. That's kind of what makes
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.520]   this cool for us. This is one of the first instances, I would say, of an idea whose birth
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.720]   was this podcast. I began bouncing these ideas around here with you, my listeners, and it evolved
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.160]   into a more polished form, the New Yorker. So here we are. Deep Questions podcast impacting
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.000]   the world of news. So you've heard these ideas before, but they're a lot more polished now. So
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.600]   let's go through it quickly. So I begin the article quoting Blake Chanley, Tick Tock's president of
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.160]   Global Business Solutions, talking about competition from Facebook. This is where he said,
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.960]   look, we're not worried. Facebook is a social platform built on a social graph. Tick Tock is
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.680]   an entertainment platform. These are two different things. Zuckerberg needs to stay in his lane. We
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.840]   have our own lane. That name should sound familiar. Blake Chanley, I talked about him on the show,
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.200]   because I discovered this interview from one of you, my listeners, sent it to me at my interesting
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:10.400]   account, Newport.com email address. So then I went deeper into this. So here's the next point
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:19.280]   I want to make. So in the article, I make this point that Facebook is trying to shift to be more
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.200]   like Tick Tock. Instagram, owned by the same company, shifting to be more like Tick Tock.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.520]   And the way they are doing this is by moving towards video, moving towards short video,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.720]   but most importantly, as I'll soon elaborate, moving towards recommendations that have nothing
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.280]   to do with the social graph, moving towards feeds that are generated purely by algorithms,
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.280]   not by who you follow, not by people you know, sharing it. So here's the quote from the article.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.960]   "This shift is not surprising given Tick Tock's phenomenal popularity, and it has been very
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:04.800]   successful, but it's also short-sighted." So the whole thesis of the article is the following.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.760]   I say, "Platforms like Facebook could be doomed if they fail to maintain the social graphs upon
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.080]   which they built their kingdoms." So this is the setup to this whole article. Tick Tock's
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.240]   really popular. Companies like, platforms like Facebook, I should say, are trying to be more
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.360]   Tick Tock-like to stave off the competition and try to have faster user growth. This could,
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:37.280]   however, doom them. All right, so let me elaborate this argument. What I'm getting at in this,
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:46.560]   the original take on this point is there's real advantages to having an online company
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.200]   like Facebook or Instagram, or as you'll see, Twitter, that relies on a social graph.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:57.760]   And to be clear, by social graph, I mean all of these individual friend requests,
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.400]   all these individual follow clicks, this topology of connections that human users built up,
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.120]   click by click, decision by decision, over months and months and years and years of use,
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.280]   these really rich networks. These give a real advantage to the early mover platforms who have
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.880]   built them up. One is a network effect advantage. So I'm highlighting these here. So I mentioned,
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.880]   for example, once Facebook had 100 million followers, active users, I should say, which
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:33.120]   it got by 2006, it became hard for anyone else to compete on a model of the people you know are here,
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.440]   as you can see what the people you know are up to. Once you have 100 million users on one platform,
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.720]   how do you start from scratch and say, "Well, we only have 10,000, but we're growing."
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.880]   So that's a huge network effect advantage. There are also other advantages to these topologies.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.520]   I talk a little bit in this article about the introduction of the retweet button to Twitter.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.360]   I think people don't understand the degree to which the introduction of the retweet button
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   not only made Twitter into a lasting company of cultural influence, but also
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.960]   really transformed social media. So here's what happened when they introduced the retweet button.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:13.760]   The friction required to send a link or tweet to your entire follower base went down to almost
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:19.360]   nothing. Before we had the retweet button, people in Twitter would have to copy tweets and they
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:26.240]   would put RT. So you remember this, if you're old enough, you would put RT in caps colon,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.360]   and then you would quote, just copy and paste quote to tweet that you're retweeting. And then
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.480]   you would put at the original person who retweeted it below it. That's a pain. Retweet button, you see
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:43.040]   something you like, click a button and it spreads. That reduction in friction made all of the
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:49.840]   difference. It unlocked what I call a fierce viral dynamic. So now a tweet that was catching the
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.880]   attention of the zeitgeist in the right way could spread through the power law topology
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:01.280]   of the Twitter social graph at frightening speed. Tens of millions, hundreds of millions
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:07.200]   of people could see something within an hour or two. And this all was based off these individual
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.120]   user decisions to retweet or not retweet. They see it from a few people, they retweet it.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.320]   This turned out to have two hugely powerful effects. One, it attracted more interesting
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.720]   people to platforms like Twitter, because there's potential here. You had the potential
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.480]   of reaching millions of people if what you wrote caught on just right. So now more interesting
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.240]   people came to Twitter. That's another big network effect advantage. If all of the interesting people
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:37.200]   are on Twitter, when a competitor came along like Parler or Gab, they didn't do as well
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.680]   because there wasn't as many interesting people on there saying interesting things.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:49.520]   Perhaps more important, these fierce viral dynamics also gave way to a frighteningly effective
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:55.680]   distributed curation mechanism. So what happened is all these individual decisions to tweet and
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:03.280]   retweet created this human powered curation algorithm that was really, really good at
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.320]   figuring out what's the most interesting, controversial, outrageous, funny, off the wall,
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.280]   but perfect meme, whatever it was. It did a really good job of selecting for these things
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.480]   and amplifying it so millions of people could see. So that was very effective. So suddenly,
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.800]   Twitter not only had interesting people on there, but it had this really good human powered
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.320]   curation, distributed curation algorithm that meant when you went on Twitter, you were going
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.920]   to see interesting things or funny things or outrageous things. And again, this is not
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:36.240]   sophisticated machine learning algorithms at play here. This is just the epiphenomenon of a lot of
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:42.400]   individuals clicking retweet or not. That's very powerful. So then as I get into it, Facebook
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:50.560]   noticed this retweet thing is working. So then by 2012, we get a share button added to the mobile
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.840]   app of Facebook. It's exactly retweet. They too wanted to take advantage of that distributed
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.960]   curation. All right, so here's my summary. Both Facebook and Twitter are built on the same general
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.160]   model of leveraging hard to replicate large social graphs to generate a never ending stream of
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:12.640]   engaging content, a strategy that proved to be robust in the face of new competition and incredibly
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.520]   lucrative. So it's the social graphs and those three advantages I just summarized,
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.680]   the people you know are on there, the interesting people are on there, and you have the distributed
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.200]   curation effect of the share and retweets. That made the small number of companies who got there
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.360]   first, Facebook, Instagram, Instagram, I took this out of the article, but I had a piece in there
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.280]   before about how Instagram basically, they were able to make a run at the castle that Facebook
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.480]   was building, because Facebook didn't understand image. And Instagram made it much easier to have
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.560]   these beautiful images, filtered, perfectly sized for iPhones. That was so powerful, that media that
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.640]   they were able to build a new audience from scratch before Facebook squashed that by buying them. So
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.280]   you have Facebook, you have Instagram, you have Twitter, these big social graphs, they can produce
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:05.840]   a nonstop stream of engaging content of a style that no one else can compete with. So if I want
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:11.840]   to go start my own social network tomorrow, to compete with those giants doing their same game,
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:19.680]   as many pretenders to the throne have encountered in the past five to 10 years, good luck. Because
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.000]   until I can get 100 million people, including a lot of people you know, and a lot of really
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.360]   interesting people with all these intricate friend and follower connections that allow
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.920]   retweets and shares to become a really effective distributed curation mechanism, until that's all
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.280]   there, this is useless. It's not that interesting. I'd rather just go on Twitter. I'd rather go on
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:43.200]   Facebook. I'd rather go on Instagram. So they had this, this readout, this digital readout that was
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:50.240]   almost impossible for anyone to raid. And so that's why these pseudo monopolies grew bigger.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:56.320]   It's why their influence on our culture became stronger. It's why we began to get really worried
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:01.040]   starting around 2016, 2017, about just how much power these small number of companies had,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.640]   because they were immune to competition. And in my opinion, were strangling the potential
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:14.080]   of the interactive web 2.0 by taking the democratic weirdness of the internet, the distributed
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.920]   homespun eccentricities of the internet and capturing it all into a small number of walled
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:29.440]   gardens. All right. Then you get TikTok. And TikTok is the, is the weird night that came out
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.800]   of the bog that suddenly threatening all the castles. It's the, I don't know Game of Thrones
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:42.400]   well, but the the woman with the dragons who comes out of nowhere and suddenly the Lannisters.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.360]   Do I have that right? I don't know. I don't know Game of Thrones. I don't know, but there's,
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.960]   you know, there's these people in charge and then there's this, this woman who had dragons and kind
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:57.760]   of came out of nowhere and TikTok was TikTok is that. Okay. So why is this the second part of my
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.960]   article? So what I, the case I make is the effectiveness of the TikTok experience is found
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:09.360]   in what it doesn't require. So TikTok's brilliance is it's the same sort of user generated content
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.920]   distraction experience, but it does not leverage a social graph. And this was the point that Blake
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.480]   Shanley was making in that very important interview. It, TikTok does not care if people,
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:24.160]   you know, are on TikTok. TikTok does not care if famous people are on TikTok. TikTok does not care
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.960]   who you follow or what you can share. There are some social features in TikTok. No one uses them.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:36.400]   It is purely algorithmic. It looks at the total pool of available videos. And by they, I mean,
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:42.480]   this brutally effective machine learning loop and says, what should I show you next? What should I
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.320]   show you next? And as far as I can tell, I really went deep into this. I tried to understand what
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.000]   was happening with this algorithm. It's all proprietary, but there is some hints. I think
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.440]   the best hints probably come from the wall street journal, which did a big study where they created
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.880]   hundreds. Well, I should speak the New York New York New Yorker fact checker corrected on the,
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:07.680]   on this more than a hundred fake accounts, which they, they tweaked very carefully and observed
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.040]   to try to understand how the recommendations were happening. And what, what seems to be happening
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.720]   with the, the TikTok algorithm is that it's, it's a, for you statistical optimizational people,
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:23.920]   it's essentially a stochastic multi-arm bandit reinforcement optimization, machine learning loop.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.160]   So go look that up if you want to bore yourself. But what it does is it's showing you a lot of
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.440]   different things at first, somewhat randomly. And the main thing it looks at is how long did
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.560]   you watch the video before you swiped up to the next one? That is its best indication of the
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:44.480]   rewards you got from that video. It then uses statistically shows you statistically similar
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.760]   videos to that one. And again, it's trying to optimize, Hey, this one that's in the same
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.320]   universe, you watched even longer. So let's, let's focus in on this as a constellation of type of
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.680]   videos you like. That's basically it. Plus some careful tuning about novelty to make sure that,
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.360]   you know, you're, you're being exposed to different things. You have a chance for your interest to
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:08.400]   wander. It's not super complicated, but within as short as 40 minutes, this is what the wall street
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:16.480]   journey found. It took about 40 minutes until the experience was almost eerie. How well this machine
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.760]   learning loop had honed in on a small number of types of videos that really push your proverbial
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:30.080]   buttons. So it's not evil genius. You know, how from the movie 2001 is sitting in a hollowed out
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.480]   volcano somewhere where we're light years ahead. It's actually a pretty simple machine learning
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.920]   loop, but no social graph. Just, we need a bunch of videos. Anyone can create videos. It doesn't
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.600]   matter if they're famous. It doesn't matter if you know them just get enough people creating
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:50.000]   videos that our algorithm can go to work. And so tick-tock can make a move at Facebook and Twitter
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.960]   because their castle walls are built around their social graph. And everyone who was trying to
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.520]   attack their castle with a similar strategy, couldn't get over those walls. Tick-tock was
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:06.080]   the woman with the dragons and they flew over. They didn't use the social graph. Okay. So what's
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:12.560]   going to happen? Well, here's the key. I think the key thing going on in social media, digital news
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.400]   is that tick-tock success. These developments put traditional social media companies like Facebook
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:25.600]   in a perilous bind. They're losing users right now to tick-tock because tick-tock again is in
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.960]   the same cognitive space. As far as a user is concerned, user created content. I want distraction
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.640]   on my phone and they're doing a better job of it. So people are going over to tick-tock and what
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:42.320]   happened? Meta found that their new user growth slowed and they lost over $200 billion in
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.520]   market capitalization in a single day when they released that report. So this is public companies,
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:53.680]   there's huge investor pressure. We can't lose, we can't have our revenue go down. We can't lose this
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.600]   many users to tick-tock, which got to a billion users in just a couple of years. It's just really
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.160]   exploding. So they have to do something. So what are they doing? They're trying to be more like
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.080]   tick-tock, which may be in the short term makes sense. They're like, okay, if this is what people
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.640]   like, we need to do the same thing. But this is where I think they accidentally destabilized their
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.680]   entire foundation of all of their protection. So here's what I wrote. If companies like Facebook,
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:21.200]   so if they instead move away from their social graph foundations to concentrate on optimizing
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.320]   in the moment engagement, they'll enter a competitive landscape that pits them directly
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:31.840]   against the many other existing sources of mobile distraction, not just tick-tock, but also more
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.560]   bespoke and specialized social networks, streaming services, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.080]   So as soon as you are offering entertainment that's not based on the social graph,
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.560]   you are competing with every other source of entertainment and distraction on the phone.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:50.560]   I don't think that's a battle that Facebook or Instagram or Twitter can win long-term. Once they
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.520]   leave the protection of their social graph, they will be chipped away from by this other competition
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:04.240]   until eventually their role of dominance is going to wane. And that's my conclusion. This all points
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.680]   to a possible future in which social media giants like Facebook may soon be past their long stretch
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.160]   of dominance. They'll continue to chase new engagement models, leaving behind the protection
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.680]   of their social graphs, and in doing so, eventually succumb to the new competitive
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:23.840]   pressures this introduces. Now, last time I talked about this idea on this show,
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.960]   some of my listeners, some of you wrote back to me and said, "Oh, so you're saying like
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:34.320]   TikTok is better or like it's somehow we're in a better world if TikTok just dominates everything?
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:39.520]   Isn't that just as bad?" So here's the key nuance, which by the way, based on your feedback
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:46.160]   as listeners, I knew to really hit this point in my New Yorker piece. TikTok, of course,
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.880]   is subject to the same pressures. So in this future, it too will eventually fade. So no,
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.800]   I do not think TikTok is going to be some 20 year long cultural force. I don't think TikTok is going
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:00.400]   to be a four year from now be a cultural force. It's entirely shallow in the sense that it has no
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:07.360]   network effect foundation. It's just purified distraction. It's incredibly shallow foundation.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:12.000]   The Zeitgeist can change on TikTok like that in a way that it couldn't on Facebook and it couldn't
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.520]   on Twitter because all your friends were already on Facebook and all the interesting people were
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.840]   on Twitter and all of these connections and those social graphs were there. And even if you soured
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.600]   on Facebook because you didn't like their role in the presidential election, or even if you soured
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.600]   on Twitter because you don't like Elon Musk, there really was no other game in town that could offer
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:34.240]   you that. TikTok has none of those advantages. It's just me look pretty screen, me like, me swipe.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.160]   Other things can serve that purpose. So if the Zeitgeist changes against TikTok,
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.680]   it could just fall out of people's favor almost immediately. So no, I don't think TikTok is going
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:49.200]   to last as some replacement force of dominance. I think it's going to it's coming in hot.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:55.280]   Twitter, maybe, but definitely Facebook, definitely Instagram chases it,
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.800]   destabilizes their competitive advantage, leads to their downfall. The only reason why I say maybe
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:06.960]   with Twitter is it has investor pressure. But as we saw with the Elon Musk bid, they're small enough
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:12.880]   they could be taken private. So if Musk had taken them private and you got rid of that investor
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.560]   pressure, he could have just said, and someone else could still do this. Let's just lean into
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.560]   what we do well. I don't care if we lose users in the short term. No one else can do what we do.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.640]   At this distributed curation of interesting things said by interesting people. So let's
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.320]   just keep doing that. We're not going to disappear. Let's just fire a bunch of people,
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:34.720]   focus, become profitable. Maybe that's a way to stick around. Facebook, Instagram, way too big.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.080]   When you're a $600 billion company, you can't go private. You can't let users fall. So I think
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.000]   they're, they're essentially doomed. So that's the future I see. And that's how I summarize this
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.400]   article. I think the social media giants, their dominance is going to wane. I think TikTok is
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.200]   going to come and go. Its main point will be it helped to stabilize those. And all of this could
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.560]   be good because it opens up the territory. You get rid of the warlords who were keeping everyone
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.480]   else down. It opens up the territory for more innovation, more interesting services, bespoke
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.880]   services, more fragmented services, more distributed or nonprofit services, crazy services that are
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.560]   homespun and eccentric. And only so many people use them, but they love them. There's more room
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:20.080]   for all of this. When you get rid of these giant a hundred billion dollar BMS that had these pseudo
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:25.200]   monopolies. And so that is the conclusion, how I conclude the article in the end, TikTok's biggest
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.960]   legacy might be less about its current moment of world conquering success, which will pass
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:37.440]   and more about how by forcing social media giants like Facebook to chase its model,
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:44.240]   it will end up liberating the social internet. So that is the polished form of my thoughts about
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:50.480]   TikTok and its impact on the internet. I think I've now talked about this enough so we can retire
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:57.040]   the topic for more, read the article at the New Yorker. You can just find my contributor page.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.880]   You'll find it. It's called TikTok in the fall of the social media giants. If you don't subscribe
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:06.800]   to the New Yorker, well, you should, but if you don't, I also wrote about the article and added
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:12.080]   some extra points in my newsletter. So go to calnewport.com/blog. And you can see the article
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.280]   I wrote about this. And while there, you should sign up for that newsletter so you can get
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.360]   sent straight to your inbox, uh, this type of thinking. So there we go.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.320]   Good summary.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:29.200]   The, uh, podcast, man, podcast made without the podcast, this idea might not have existed. It was
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   riffing on the news stuff that listeners sent me that I would not have seen. I would not have seen
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:41.360]   that article about Blake Chan, Lee and CNBC, et cetera. Uh, if a listener had sent it to us and
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.400]   then since it, so I wouldn't have seen it and then we were riffing on it, you and I on the show.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.200]   And that sort of set the wheels in motion. So that's cool. Yeah. It's podcast. There was some
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:54.320]   vocabulary in there that I didn't even know. So I learned something for sure. Welcome to the New
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:01.200]   Yorker world. Yeah. You got out with the doors. You got to have a source handy, by the way,
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.840]   speaking of New Yorker and then we'll move on. But I read the, you told me about the article from
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.840]   last week, Ted Friends article about the door to door salesman. Oh yeah. I haven't finished that.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.160]   Yeah. That's really good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Jesse told me, I always, if people, people ask me,
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:19.760]   how do I read, what's my New Yorker reading habits with the magazine? Um, because it's hard,
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.920]   it's long and it comes every week. So here it is. So here's my New Yorker reading habits. So you can,
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:29.840]   you can follow suit if you subscribe. So you get the daily email and that points out like what's
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:35.280]   going on, what was posted on the web that day. What's interesting. So I would say 50% of the
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.080]   daily emails will point out an article that I ended up reading on the web because they published
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.720]   like a new article every day on the web, uh, for the magazine. My rule is like, you always have to
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.520]   read one. And if there's sometimes we'll read more than one, but you always have to read one.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.520]   And so that forces you, even if it's a day where the five articles, none of them are right in your
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.880]   sweet spot, you read about door to door salesman or something else. It's really interesting. And
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.840]   so that's my role. Read the daily email to see what catches your attention. That's where a lot
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.920]   of my stuff is featured. So definitely read that. And then you got to read one, one per week,
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:12.080]   at least I have a similar rule to look at the table of contents and then circle two. And then
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:16.240]   if there's two, I like, then I read them. And then it breaks the seal and then you end up reading
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.720]   more a lot of times, but like, you always have to read at least one. Oh, and then the third rule
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.240]   is you have to leave the magazine out kind of prominently in your house or apartment.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.360]   And like, Oh, when people come over, Oh, sorry, let me just clean this up over here. I just was,
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.680]   you got to put it next to your copy of the Harper's in the Paris.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.080]   You recycle them a lot quickly thereafter.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:42.880]   Yeah. It was just when the pile grows, I suppose. All right. So anyways, as mentioned, two parts to
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:48.400]   the show, the follow part one, email part two, a bunch of questions about living the deep life.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:56.480]   Before we get to that first part though, let me talk briefly about a brand new sponsor of this
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:05.120]   show, which is 80,000 hours. Where's that come from? Where's that number come from? Well, if you
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.720]   do the math, you have roughly 80,000 hours in your career. So that's 40 hours a week,
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   50 weeks a year for 40 years, you have about 80,000 hours to work in your career.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.600]   So that adds up. They're one of your biggest opportunities. What you do with your work is
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.880]   one of your biggest opportunities to make a positive impact on the world, but where should
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:36.400]   you start? This is where 80,000 hours comes in. It is a nonprofit co-founded by Will McCaskill,
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.720]   a philosopher at Oxford. Will is probably known best as being a co-founder of the effective
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.960]   altruism movement. He does all of the major podcasts. You've probably heard him on Tim
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:52.640]   Ferris' show among other shows. It's about doing evidence-based numbers driven altruism. That's
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:57.680]   the effective altruism movement. How do I make the most difference with what I have to give?
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:03.680]   He helped found this nonprofit 80,000 hours that helps people make the most out of their careers.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.840]   I've known them for a long time. I've known the guys involved with this since they were just
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.920]   getting off the ground because obviously I wrote a book about career advice so good they can't
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.480]   ignore you. And so they borrowed, they liked those ideas and elaborated them into their own ideas.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.520]   And I've known these guys and talked about them for a long time. I think it's so cool that it's a
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.040]   nonprofit that's just focused on evidence-based approaches to figuring out how to make the most
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:33.280]   of your career. If you like my style of advice, you're going to like what they offer over at
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:38.080]   80,000 hours. So what can you do? What do they offer? Well, you can join the free newsletter.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.440]   And if you do, they will send you an in-depth guide that helps you identify the problems that
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.600]   are most pressing where you personally can have the biggest impact of those problems and help you
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:53.360]   get ideas, new ideas for high impact careers or directions that will help you tackle those issues.

[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.800]   the world if you're exhausted and out of shape and have no energy. So that brings us to our next
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:20.320]   sponsor, which is My Body Tutor. My Body Tutor was founded by Adam Gilbert, who I've known for a long
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:27.520]   time, used to be the fitness advice guru for my newsletter. His company, My Body Tutor is a 100%
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.640]   online coaching program that solves the biggest problem in health and fitness, which is lack of
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:39.760]   consistency. You get assigned an online coach who comes up with a plan for you about eating,
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:45.600]   movement and fitness. And then you check in with that coach with the app digitally every day.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.640]   And every day that coach will then send you feedback to help keep you motivated, but also
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.960]   to help you answer your questions or tweak your program as needed. Having someone you're working
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:01.680]   with every day is the key to success. And by doing it all 100% online, it is finally affordable for
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:08.800]   those of us who cannot have a live-in personal trainer. So if you're serious about getting fit,
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.320]   Adam is giving Deep Questions listeners $50 off their first month. All you have to do is mention
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:23.520]   this podcast when you join. So go to mybodytutor.com, mention Deep Questions when you join to
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:35.600]   get $50 off. You know what I heard Jesse, speaking of My Body Tutor. So I went to see Top Gun Maverick
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.840]   with Julie the other night. A lot of fun. Yeah, people liked it.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.520]   Did you see it? No, but.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.880]   You know the original though? Yeah.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.040]   Yeah. Cause they have one of these beach,
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.200]   shirtless beach sports scenes. So in the original it was beach volleyball.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.320]   In which, and I really implore people just to ponder this, ponder this reality.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:02.480]   The original movie, Tom Cruise, San Diego, hot sunny day, shirtless volleyball, wearing blue jeans.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:09.280]   Wearing blue jeans. I mean, it's, it's the, the most random worst thing you could possibly wear
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.720]   to play beach volleyball in the sand on a sunny day.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.480]   Well, it's cause he's on his motorcycle, right?
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.360]   Yeah. But.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.760]   Yeah. And then he goes to a date. Anyways, so they do a new scene in this one. Uh,
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:24.080]   is they're playing like football on the beach or whatever. One's shirtless and Tom Cruise looks.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:30.320]   Crazily yoked for someone who was like 57 when he filmed it. Uh, but what I, I, I heard on a
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:35.520]   rewatchables episode about Top Gun Maverick is that the Tom Cruise, like a couple of weeks after
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.680]   they filmed that, it's like, I don't like the footage. We need to go back and refilm it.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:45.120]   And it. Pissed off everybody on the crew because they had taper. They had built out these whole
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.040]   programs. So this is like a little peek behind the curtain, these whole fitness and eating
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.040]   programs to peak right at the film this, because you have to, the whole point of those scenes is
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.120]   to be like doing, pretending like you're not flexing, but you're flexing as hard as you can.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.800]   And they had all like, let themselves go in two weeks is enough time. So they were all having to
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.120]   like desperately go back and try to like start cut weight and dehydrate themselves and get, you know,
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.560]   um, so anyways, I thought it was funny. That's a peak behind the curtain. So when you see the
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.760]   shirtless guys on whatever these movies, it's like, there's a lot of work that goes into that.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.400]   So maybe they got their, my body tutor accounts going again. All right. Let's do some questions.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:26.240]   Got a bunch of questions here in a row, go through quick, all in the same topic, email.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:33.520]   Let's get our email going here. The first comes from Zach. Zach says, although my reliance
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:39.360]   on email is slowly dwindling, it is still rampant in my organization.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   So I remain reliant on it to a decent extent. How long do you give someone in 2022?
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:51.440]   To respond to a non-emergency email before you ping them again.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:57.680]   All right, Zach, here's my tough love contrarian take on this question.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:04.480]   If someone's not responding to your email, it's because you wrote a bad email.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:11.840]   So I am less interested in etiquette for pinging people and more interested in getting you to a
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:17.760]   place where you don't have to ping people at all. Right. Why don't people respond to emails? It's
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:24.960]   typically because what you sent arrived in their inbox, like an ambiguous obligation grenade.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.920]   They're just like, I don't know what to do with this thing. It's it, you threw it off the top
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:34.320]   of your mind. You're playing obligation, hot potato, where this was an open loop for you.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.600]   And if you send it to someone else, it's off your mind, at least for now. And it's, Hey,
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.760]   what's your thoughts on the clients coming next week or something like just like weird and vague
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.680]   and ambiguous. And what you're really doing is just saying, tag, you're it. You have the hot
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.240]   potato. You have to keep track of this for now. I get a moment to a moment of relief when those
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.400]   obligation hand grenades arrived. Like, I don't even know exactly how to answer this. There's a
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:59.760]   piece to it that doesn't make sense to me. I don't want to do that work. I'm going to ignore it if I
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:06.400]   all at all can. And that's mainly why emails get ignored. They freeze people. So what you need to
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:12.160]   do, Zach is provide structure in your email about exactly what you need for them to answer. They
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:18.560]   need to see exactly what is required in them to respond. And if you can't pin that down, you're
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:24.320]   not ready to send them that email. You either need to get more clear, just thinking about it yourself.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:29.280]   Okay. If I really think about this, there's three options here. These two options, I don't need your
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.160]   help. This option, I would need this piece of information from you. So I'm going to ask you
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.920]   for this. So either you have to think about this more yourself, or you need to talk to that person.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.800]   Right. You need to real time. So be it on the phone or in their office or at the tail end of a
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.720]   zoom meeting, be like, look, I can't quite get my arms around this, but we got to figure out what
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.400]   to do about this client meeting. What's going on? What do you think? Like what? And just give
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:53.120]   a couple minutes. And in that quick back and forth, you can actually take this ambiguous thing
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.800]   and figure out a couple of concrete things that need to happen. So the emails, if an email leaves
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:04.560]   your inbox and arrives in someone else's, there has to be absolute clarity for that person about
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.560]   what you need from them. And they know what to do. You need this answer. You need this question.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.240]   You need to decide between these three things. You need to send me this document. You need me
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:16.400]   to choose from this list of things, make that crystal clear, and they'll love to answer it.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.520]   Say thoughts, question mark, and they're going to run away from that grenade so that the resulting
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:30.480]   productivity shrapnel doesn't shred their schedule. All right. Ricardo email question number two.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:39.200]   Ricardo says, do you recommend having multiple email accounts for someone who works at different
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.400]   institutions, but does more or less the same work? Ricardo, the answer is yes.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:55.200]   And the idea you need to really digest here is that the cost of context shifting
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:03.440]   far outweighs any of the advantages of having minor technologically enhanced efficiencies by,
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.040]   well, everything's in the same inbox. So I can just log in once and everything's there and I
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.560]   can type really fast. Technological efficiencies like saving keystrokes, saving clicking on things,
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.720]   saving having to log into places, like all those technological efficiencies, those are minor,
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:23.120]   minor advantages, and they are swamped by the advantage of not switching the cognitive context
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.600]   in which you're operating from one to another, one to another. So imagine you work for two
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:35.040]   organizations. And in scenario A, you have an email account for this organization, there's five
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.520]   messages in there, and you have a separate account. You have to log out and log into this other one
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.680]   for the other organization. You have five messages in there. So you log into the first one, you go
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:48.320]   through those messages, you log out, you load up the website, the Google workspace for the other
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.640]   one, you log into that one, you answer those five messages. That's scenario A. Scenario B is you
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.200]   have these all come into one inbox, you can see them all together. It's open, you don't have to
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:02.640]   log in, log out. Scenario A is significantly better. You will get those emails answered
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:08.240]   significantly faster and with much less cognitive friction. Why? Because when you're in the first
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.160]   institution's inbox, that's your cognitive context. You load up everything relevant to
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.960]   that institution. So now you can rock and roll as you move through those emails. Then you spend a
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.880]   minute to log into the other one. And you get into the cognitive context of that other institution,
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.720]   then you get a rock and roll and go faster. Switching back and forth between those two
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.480]   contexts in scenario B where they're all in the same inbox, that switching back and forth is going
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:34.240]   to slow you and slow you and slow you, increase the friction, increase your quality of thought,
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:41.040]   make the task more difficult. So yes, keep separate inboxes. I have
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:50.400]   four or five inboxes, I'm trying to think. I have a Georgetown address with its own inbox.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:38:01.920]   I have a personal Gmail inbox address with its own inbox. I have the calnewpork.com addresses go into
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:07.360]   their own inbox of which there's a few. There's the interesting and there's author, there's a few.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:14.000]   And then I have a New Yorker email address that goes into its own inbox. So I have four distinct
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.360]   inboxes, four distinct logins. And I wouldn't do it any other way. Multiple email addresses.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:30.480]   All right, Chris, moving on. Chris asks, "Do you think there's a place for inbox zero
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:37.520]   in your productivity system? If yes, how do you manage to keep up with your inbox without spending
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:43.040]   hours on reading, classifying, answering mails, even if you only spend that time in specific time
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:51.280]   blocks?" So I think, Chris, yes. Inbox zero, by which I mean an inbox that on a regular basis
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:58.640]   goes down to having no messages in it. Yes, is a good goal. And two, this should not require
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:04.320]   hours of reading, classifying, and answering emails. Now, I don't mean to say it doesn't
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.320]   require that right now. I think for most people, the way they use their email, the way they use
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.960]   their inboxes to get it down to zero would require hours of them going through this. It would be a
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:21.360]   Herculean task. But if you update and improve your relationship with this tool, getting down to inbox
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:26.080]   zero becomes much more tractable. And it's what you want to do, because getting down to inbox zero
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:31.040]   means you have a pipeline of incoming and outcoming information that you're keeping up with.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.800]   I mean, the only thing it means if your inbox is getting bigger and bigger is that the pipeline
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:39.120]   of stuff coming in, you can't keep up with it. You don't have other systems for it. And you have
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:44.240]   this default spillover. Let's just keep stuff in our inbox. So let me give you four things you can
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:50.720]   do, Chris, or things you can do to improve your relationship with inbox that with your inbox,
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:57.760]   that will make inbox zero much more tractable. All right, number one, don't use email for back
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:02.880]   and forth conversation. Don't I got to figure something out, we got to go back and forth about
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:07.680]   it. Don't do that with email. That generates a huge amount of email. It's a huge pain.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:12.720]   Back and forth conversation should be synchronous. There's a lot of ways to do this. There's office
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.160]   hours, there's calls, they're tacking on conversations to the end of pre existing
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:21.040]   meetings, however you want to do it. If it requires back and forth, you should be talking
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:26.160]   to a person, two minutes can accomplish what 20 back and forth emails would otherwise be required
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:32.640]   to do. Number two, don't store information in your inbox. This is a child's way of doing
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:37.040]   knowledge work information management. You're a grown up, you need something more sophisticated.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.440]   You have to have places where you store relevant information, you have to have places where you
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.480]   keep track of what you're working on, what you're waiting for, and what you know about it.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:50.240]   I personally recommend something like a Trello board, one for each of your different professional
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:55.840]   roles, where you can keep track of what's in progress, what you know about it, what you're
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:02.400]   waiting to hear back on. So if in one of your roles as a professor, you are the head of the
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.760]   faculty advisory committee, I say this from experience, I'm about to take on that role as
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.560]   the head of the faculty advisory committee in September, have a board for that. If there's
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.120]   things you're waiting to hear back from, you're trying to talk to your committee members about
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:20.320]   when to meet, or you're waiting to hear someone is taking a stab at writing up the report that
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.760]   you're going to bring to the faculty meeting, you should have a column in your Trello board for that
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.080]   role that says waiting to hear back from, and that's where those are, not an email in your
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:32.080]   inbox that you hope you just see and say, oh yeah, that's right. I'm waiting for someone to respond
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.480]   to that email. Let's say you're working on something in one of your roles, have a projects
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:41.120]   column and there's a card for it on your Trello board, and you're attaching the relevant files
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.440]   to it, and right at the top of the card, you say capital letters, status, colon, quick update on
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.840]   that status. You look at the board for that role, you get the whole just stalled to what's going on
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:56.480]   in five minutes. None of this needs to be in your inbox. So again, keeping track of what's going on
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.560]   in your inbox is a child's way of managing information. Be an adult, be more sophisticated.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:10.000]   Three, use process centric emails. Now I talked about this in a habit tune up. I think Jesse
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.720]   would have to go back to the archives, but I think in the last couple of months, I did a habit tune
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:22.720]   up on process centric emails. There's probably a YouTube video on that at youtube.com/calendarmedia.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:28.480]   But here's the brief summary. When you send an email to someone to initiate something that needs
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:35.440]   to get done, this meeting has to get set up, this client visit needs to be arranged. First, figure
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:40.720]   out the entire process for how you're going to get to completion. I will put up some ideas by this
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:45.680]   date. You will look at those ideas and mark the ones that work best. I'll then send a complete
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.400]   list once you've marked that on Wednesday morning to the client, and then I'll update you on our
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.160]   staff meeting on Friday, what we're going to do. Come up with the process for how you're going to
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:59.920]   get from here to completion and explain that process in the very first email you send about
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:06.320]   that obligation. Significantly reduces the number of back and forth messages that follow because you
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:13.280]   have a clear process about what you guys are going to do. Number four, things that are informational
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:21.920]   newsletters, like my newsletter, calnewport.com, broadcast of deals, whatever it is that you get
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.000]   just informationally through your inbox where you never know which ones are going to be interesting,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.360]   what won't. You might want to save things for a while to see if you want to read it.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.480]   Have a separate account for that. And if it's too late to have a separate account, then set up a
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:39.840]   filter to a separate label or folder, and you can update what gets filtered and treat that differently.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:45.120]   Oh, here's my informational account. Here's my informational label or folder. And that's different.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.280]   That's outside of your inbox, your worldview, because there's no stress captured by those
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:55.840]   messages. None of them make any demands of you or your time. It's a digital library for you to
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:01.760]   browse at your leisure. So separate that from the rest of your inbox. Then you can inbox zero what
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:08.720]   remains. All right, Chris, so there you go. The backstory on inbox zero, I wrote about this,
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:14.400]   that term in a piece I wrote a few years ago for the New Yorker called the rise and fall of getting
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:19.120]   things done. Merlin Mann, the productivity guru Merlin Mann, it was his book contract to write
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:24.720]   a book titled Inbox Zero that essentially broke him and his interest in productivity.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:32.320]   He struggled so philosophically about what's the point of getting super fiddly about processing
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.000]   emails in your inbox. It's actually what broke him. And he just couldn't write the book. He was
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.280]   on the contract, couldn't do it. And so it was like the Inbox Zero book was what broke. Inbox
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:49.440]   Zero broke Merlin Mann's productivity standing or interest in his interesting little tidbit from the
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:55.760]   history of productivity. All right, so I promised ITs to have it tune up for a new piece of advice
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:00.240]   that if you work in an organization with other people, I said would be one of the single most
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:06.400]   effective things you could do to reduce emails in your inbox. So here it is, I call it
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:18.320]   docket clearing meetings. This is a phrase I'm stealing shamelessly from the Judge John Hodgman
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.560]   podcast. They have the docket clearing episodes where they go through a bunch of cases.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:28.320]   It's a judicial term where a judge has a bunch of cases on their docket that they want to get
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:34.640]   through real quick. Your team, whatever team you work with in your knowledge work office organization,
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:40.720]   consider once or twice a week having a regularly scheduled docket clearing meeting. Here is how
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:47.360]   this meeting works. At all times, there is a shared document accessible by everyone in your team.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:53.840]   As tasks or questions come up that's relevant for the team, someone here needs to work on this,
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:58.960]   we need to look into updating the website, we have a client visit coming up, we need to
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.120]   start the process for getting our next quarterly reports running. Anything that comes up, here's
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:09.040]   a new obligation or question that someone or some subset of people on team have to work on,
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:13.360]   you put it on the shared doc. And when you get to the docket clearing meeting,
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.440]   you go through that shared doc all together. So you're all there in the same room or on the same
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:22.000]   Zoom conference if it's a distributed remote company, and you go through the things one by
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.440]   one. Okay, this thing here. Is this important? Okay, who's going to do it? What do we need?
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:30.400]   Could we just do it right now? Is it quick? Someone just do it. Oh, you're going to handle
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.840]   it. So what information do you need from who? Okay, and when are they going to get that to you?
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.960]   What form? Let me just let's write this down in the shared docs, we have a record of it. Great,
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.840]   next, next, next. And you go through each of these things and you resolve the questions assigned to
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:47.120]   work, do the small things right away. And people come out of the docket clearing meeting, you've
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.720]   cleared a lot of this work off your team's plate and the stuff that remains has been clarified.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:57.760]   That discussion, couple minutes of discussion that each task gets, gets rid of the need to
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.840]   have all these ambiguous back and forth emails, you're playing obligation hot potato for a while
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.440]   until it gets urgent, you're not quite sure what's going to happen. It allows you to just
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:10.880]   execute the work. If you have a docket clearing meeting for 30 minutes twice a week,
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.440]   small footprint, 30 minutes twice a week, same time your whole team,
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:22.400]   you will reduce the number of emails each team member receives in their inbox by a factor of
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:27.600]   three or four. And not only will you reduce the number of emails by a big factor, but the
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.280]   type of email you're taking out of their inbox by having these meetings are the type that are
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:36.960]   the worst. The ambiguous back and forth the conversations, the like, can you deal with this,
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.400]   you don't even know what that means the stuff that really gives you the indigestion,
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:45.920]   the stuff that causes the anxiety. So it is an incredibly effective tool. If you work in
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:53.680]   any sort of team, you should have docket clearing meetings. So there is my new piece of advice.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.480]   I like it.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.120]   That's actually in a slow productivity, you know, I'm working on the book.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:04.240]   And so I have these principles. And then the principles underneath the principles are
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:08.720]   propositions, which are kind of where we get concrete, you know, like, do work on this work
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:14.240]   on that, we give some more concrete ideas. And so the propositions have, they come with some like
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:18.560]   actual pieces of advice. So some of the book is philosophical and manifesto style, some is idea
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:26.080]   writing, some is, let's get concrete. And that came out of me working on a proposition about
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:32.240]   containing the small things. So the footprint stays small in your work life. And that's, you
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:37.200]   know, I was just working out the the docket clearing meeting idea. It's the I presented
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:43.120]   in the book as the team counterpart to office hours for the individual. So, you know, as you
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:47.280]   know, I'm a huge believer of you should have office hours three times a week, everyone knows when they
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:51.920]   are almost anything smaller conversational or back and forth conversation requiring you to say,
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:56.160]   great, grab me at my office hours, grab me at my office hours, you're just defending people off,
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.840]   we have your shield of your office hours, you're just defending yourself as all these ambiguous
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:04.240]   obligation hand grenades come near you, is knock them all away and just make everyone come every
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.960]   day, there's 30 minutes, they can always come and find you. And that's a huge inbox saver.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:14.320]   But team stuff requires its own type of strategy. So there we go. Docket clearing meetings.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:19.680]   I've been thinking about slow bar activity a lot. Yeah, just done different things I work on,
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:24.000]   whether it's like work or even getting better at sports. I think about it all the time.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.200]   I finished the chapter, well, the first draft of the chapter on doing fewer things,
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:34.080]   principle one. It was a beast. It was 25,000 words, I got it down to 18,000 words
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.560]   out of my hands. My editor has it took me a long time. So I was trying to figure out the voice.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.240]   I think I found the voice for the book, but we'll knock on wood, we'll see.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:49.600]   So I've started now, I'm working on a part one chapter. So part one is more like ideas. So part
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:53.360]   one chapter that's, I'm not going to give too many details because it might also be a New Yorker
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:58.000]   piece. So I like to keep that kind of secret. And I'm beginning the background research for the next
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:05.520]   principle, which is work at a natural pace. And, you know, this, this idea of constant,
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:10.240]   like you just work, you know, five days a week, eight hours straight, just again and again, and
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:16.400]   again, just going after getting after it, just intense. It's very unnatural. It doesn't really
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:19.760]   match the way that really interesting stuff is produced. I'm just getting the weeds there.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:24.240]   And I won't give too many details yet, but, but yesterday I was spending a lot of time reading
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:33.760]   about the timelines of famous scientists from the early Renaissance period. And let's just say the
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:41.040]   pace at which they developed and published their ideas is anything but fast. Like a year will go by
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:45.440]   that's not working on it. And then like the summer they work on it and then they have to send a
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:51.120]   letter and it's 15, 57, 67. So it's going to take, you know, three months before they hear back.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:56.320]   It's like a slower pace. They're very productive because they invented, you know, gravity.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:06.960]   That's coming along. All right. Speaking of, I'm going to make this transition land.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.000]   Got a lot of really good analogies today.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.080]   Yeah. I'm trying to transition to sponsors.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.240]   I'm still thinking about the dragon going over the wall.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.960]   Yeah. Yeah. It'd be better if I knew the name of that character from game of Thrones.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.840]   I wish I knew it too.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:27.920]   It's not Cersei Lannister is the person in power, the wife of the Joffrey. They're the people in
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:32.720]   power, the queen of the dragons. I don't know. I don't know the show. The only thing I know about
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:36.880]   the show is someone sent me a clip, which I really enjoy. I guess there was an episode in the last
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:42.160]   season where it's this dragon woman and they're in a tavern and it's, I don't know, dwarves and
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:46.160]   swords and stuff. And someone left the Starbucks cup in there and it made it into the show.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:50.000]   And it's, it's, it's fantastic. They're in this tavern and they're all in there and
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.600]   there's just a Starbucks cup sitting on the table. I appreciated that. All right. There's
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:59.440]   a transition. So speaking of Starbucks, Starbucks, which is a commercial company,
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:04.640]   I want to tell you about one of the sponsors that makes this show possible. And that is our good
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:10.080]   friends at eight sleep. I've been thinking about eight sleep a lot recently because again,
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.920]   and this is a scientific measurement, the temperature outside here in DC today is
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:18.400]   175 degrees Fahrenheit. I think I'm reading that correct.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:24.640]   When it is hot, you're uncomfortable when it's hot and you're trying to sleep. Good luck.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:32.560]   This is where the eight sleep pod enters the scene. It is the ultimate sleep machine because
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:39.040]   it helps you control the temperature of your sleep. It dynamically cools or heats each side
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:43.440]   of your bed. You can set each side of your bed separately to maintain an optimal sleeping
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:50.160]   temperature. You can start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees or as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:55.440]   This stuff matters. Clinical data shows that eight sleep users experience up to 19% increase
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:02.560]   in recovery, up to 32% improvement in sleep quality and up to 34% more deep sleep. So
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:07.600]   eight sleep just launched the next generation of their pod. They call it the pod three,
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:12.160]   which enables more accurate sleep and health tracking and double the amount of sensors
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:18.720]   delivering you the best sleep experience on earth, man, when it is warm, I can't sleep.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:28.320]   You gotta have a pod. So go to eight sleep.com/deep to start sleeping cool this summer and save $150
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:33.360]   on the pod. Eight sleep currently ships within USA, Canada and the UK, select countries in the
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:42.000]   EU and Australia. Also want to talk about our good friends at Blinkist. Blinkist has been sponsoring
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.800]   us so long, Jesse, that I feel like we should have a branded studio. It's Cal and Jesse coming to you
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:52.880]   from the Blinkist, what do you call it? Blinkist studio. Yeah. Blinkist big idea studio. And they're
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:57.920]   right up our alley. You know the drill. You've heard me talk about them. Blinkist is a subscription
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:05.040]   service that offers you these 15 minute summaries. You can read or listen to called blinks of
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:10.960]   thousands of nonfiction titles spread over 27 categories. It is the best way to quickly see
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:17.520]   what a book is about. What are the main ideas? Why do you want to do that? So that if there's a topic
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.120]   you care about, you can get a quick summary. If there's a topic you want to know more about,
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:28.160]   you can figure out which book to buy. I always blink a potential nonfiction book before I make
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.280]   the decision to buy it or not to figure out what's going on here. What are the main ideas? Have I
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:36.800]   heard this before? Does this sound original? Is this going to increase what I understand or not?
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:42.640]   Blinkist is essential for anyone who embraces the reading life. And I'm hoping most of the
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:49.440]   listeners of this show do. All right. So that's 5,000 titles, 27 categories, bestsellers, and
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:58.880]   more technical books. I was looking at the blink not long ago of blockchain revolution. Blockchain
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:04.560]   is a complicated technology. Is this book technical? Is it big ideas? Is it crypto bros or
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:09.200]   more computer science? How do you find out? Give me 15 minutes. I'll put the audio blink on. I'll

[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:56.400]   We'll start with a call. We'll kick things off with a call from Michael. All right, here we go.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:01.920]   Hey, Cal and Jesse. First off, thanks for all that you guys do. Big fan of your work.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:08.480]   I recently quit my job as a product manager in tech to find more meaning in my work and really
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:14.720]   just become self-employed. I have a few main areas that I want to grow in and would like to know how
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:22.640]   you suggest balancing efforts on a macro and micro scale. Just for context, the three areas are,
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:27.840]   first off, my main project is a website for runners, training plans and such. I have one business
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:33.360]   partner and we plan to launch it soon. I've been working on that for about a year. Secondly, I'm
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:38.960]   taking a course to build out a skill set as a UI designer. I want to do UI design for my own
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:44.000]   projects and perhaps freelance someday. And then thirdly, I just want to create more online
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.800]   blogging videos, using social to connect with others and really just make useful content around
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:56.400]   my interests. Speaking of my interests, I'm just a super curious person, have a lot of hobbies as it
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:02.880]   is. So guitar, action sports, music making, photo video, and all of these interests pull for my time
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:09.920]   and attention as well. I have tried to do day theming and use systematic time blocking really
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:14.880]   to attack all these different areas and interests, but it just felt too rigid and formulaic to me.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:22.000]   So yeah, my key question is how do you suggest I focus on a macro and micro scale to have progress
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   in these multiple areas, which all feel important to me? Thanks guys.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:34.240]   Well, the issue is if you're trying to make progress on all of those things at the same time,
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:41.840]   you will make meaningful progress on almost none of them, right? And this is a principle
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:45.680]   that's on my mind because I write about this actually in the slow productivity book we were
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:50.720]   talking about before in my chapter on doing fewer things and not to give away too much, but I, but I
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:58.160]   have this, uh, I have a whole chapter section in that chapter about this, this reality that the,
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:08.000]   the function that mediates the relationship between effort and reward, we often incorrectly
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.120]   think about that as a, as a linear function, no matter what we spend our time on. So you sort of
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:18.320]   spend 10 hours working on things, you get 10 hours worth of reward, but that's not actually how it
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:23.680]   works. It, it, it tends to be more non-linear. So if you spend a lot of time on one thing,
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:29.440]   the reward you begin to get for that time takes off and gets bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.640]   So you kind of have these moments, these discontinuities where the, the, the rewards
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:36.880]   you get after you've really focused on something for a while really jumps up that reward curve
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:44.160]   really jumps up. So the reality of this is it is not the same to take a set pool of hours
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:49.280]   and split it among multiple things, or put all that time on the one thing. You do not end up
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:56.640]   with the same reward in the end. If this function was simply linear, then spending one hour on 10
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:00.400]   separate projects would give you the same reward as 10 hours on one project. So you might as well
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.760]   do the 10 separate projects because it's interesting. It keeps your options open,
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:08.480]   et cetera. But if it's not linear, which is what I argue is true, then putting 10 hours on one
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:12.640]   project could give you a massive reward. We're putting one hour in each project might not get
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:16.560]   you much at all. All right. So that's kind of technical here, but it all leads to, I think the,
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:22.320]   the obvious conclusion, which is you need to do less. Now that's scary because you're thinking,
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:26.320]   well, these things are important to me. There's different aspects of my life. There's different
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:30.240]   options I want to pursue. I can't just stop everything. So I'm going to give you a two-step
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:36.400]   process here. One, I do think you need to simplify, especially in that world of hobbies, et cetera.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:40.320]   Like this is what you're going for in your professional life. And maybe
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:45.680]   outside of your professional life, you cut this down to a two things, maybe three.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:52.160]   Next, you want to have one point of major focus that is getting most of your time and everything
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:57.040]   else you want to baseline. Baseline means you have some sort of maintenance ritual or habit.
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:02.880]   So it's not forgotten, but it's not getting much of your time. And most of your time is on one
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:10.240]   thing. So like professionally, maybe most of that time is going into the new website, though I might
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.880]   recommend that sounds like this UX, you need a job, right? You quit your job. So like if UX is
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.760]   going to be your career, that might be the thing you're really putting your time into. And you're
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.120]   just baselining the website. Let's put that on hold for now or just make very small progress.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.960]   I'm going all in on the UX design. Choose one thing I go all in on. You might, again, with your
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:29.200]   hobbies have something similar. You have a background fitness routines. You stay in shape
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.800]   for various action sports you're interested in, but you're not doing any training for those sports.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:38.160]   And all of your hobby time is going into guitar. So like you baseline almost everything and a very
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.000]   small number of things you put time into, because again, you put enough time into something.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.920]   That's when you get these discontinuity, these discontinuities, these big jumps in the rewards you
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:50.160]   get. And then once you focus on something for a while, and have had a big jump in reward,
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:54.160]   then you can turn your attention to something else and do something similar for the next six
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.000]   months, next year, the next two years, whatever it takes. So you have to you have to simplify.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   And then even once you simplify, only one or two things should be getting any sort of serious
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.360]   attention at a time, that in the end is going to unlock way more reward than trying to keep
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.480]   switching back and forth really quickly. So that's what I recommend. What I'm saying here is
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.440]   pretty similar to my deep life buckets, Keystone habit type advice, we'll get to that in a second
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:23.040]   that sort of more, I would say more philosophical thinking, which covers not just work, but your
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:27.120]   whole life, we'll get into that more in a future question. But it is similar. And that's on purpose,
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:31.520]   because I think this idea of baselining what's important, but putting huge energy into a small
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.080]   number of things at a time, that's the right formula. Alright, so speaking of which, this
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:42.400]   next question, we'll let us get into that. It comes from beyond hope. Beyond hope says,
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:47.200]   I'm in a situation right now where I have no responsibility. I'm living alone,
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:53.680]   not with my family. I have no obligations and a good job. Yet I find in myself no motivation
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:02:00.240]   to be productive. I know desperately I want to be productive. But in spite of knowing everything
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.080]   about it, I don't know how to get my life in order, stop procrastinating and begin living
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.160]   a deliberate life. Do you have any advice for a person who seems to be beyond hope?
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:13.920]   So for longtime listeners, I'm gonna be a broken record here. They know what I'm going to say.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:18.320]   And as the philosophical elaboration of the advice I just gave to that caller,
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:26.960]   work the deep life buckets. The reason why you're probably stuck is that you are all over the place
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.560]   with your efforts to quote unquote, be more productive. I don't know what that means.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.080]   And you're quote, to live a more deliberate life. I don't really know what that means. So you just,
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.880]   it sounds like you're trying things in the elaboration. You sent me to your question.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.120]   You were talking about lots of in the weeds type of organizational habits,
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.600]   like time blocking and planning and all these types of things, how you keep track of your notes.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:53.600]   So the good news is you have this core ambition that you want something more meaningful or deeper
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:57.120]   out of your life. The bad news is, is you don't know what to do with that ambition. So you try
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.320]   lots of things and they kind of fizzle and you feel like you're getting no traction. The deep
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:04.800]   life buckets will give you traction. So let's be brief because we talk about this a lot.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:09.600]   You first identify the major areas of your life that are important to you. We call these the deep
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:14.960]   life buckets. This might be craft, like your work community, the people you care about,
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.680]   or the people you're trying to lead. Constitution, which is your health contemplation,
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:25.760]   which can cover both theology, ethics, philosophy, that role in your life, et cetera.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:30.400]   Right. So you have these different areas. Great. So now we have a starting point to work from
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.960]   next. And I'm going to add an update here. So for people who know the bucket system,
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:39.840]   I'm adding a little bit of an update here. So breaking news next, have a crystal clear
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.000]   vision for each of these buckets for what you want that part of your life to be like.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.320]   And this should not be entirely high level. It shouldn't just be I am a leader in my community,
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.760]   have some concrete markers of what it would mean to be successful with that vision.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:01.920]   Right. So when I'm thinking about writing, it's really important to me that my writing is high
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.720]   impact and respected and really impacts the world. When I was going through this exercise
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:12.320]   recently, updating my thoughts about my buckets. Here's the concrete instantiation
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:19.600]   of achieving that goal. When I have a new book come out, you will find it in the on a table in
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.200]   most bookstores in the country. Right. That's a concrete instantiation of this, this bigger
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.760]   ambition of like you're known as a writer. You have an impact on the culture. People know you,
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.680]   they know your books, your books have cultural valence. How do you capture that in something
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.600]   concrete? Well, for me, it's, Hey, I want to be one of those authors. If they have a new book,
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.960]   come out like bookstores, like, of course, we're going to put this out. Everyone, we know Cal
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.040]   Newport. People know that author, his book sell well. So that's what I mean by having a crystal
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:50.960]   clear vision that has a concrete instantiation of, of this would be an example of something.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:55.840]   If I had done this, I'm living out that vision. All right. Number two. Now we get back to familiar
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:02.240]   territory for long time listeners, keystone habit for each bucket. One thing you do on a daily
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:09.840]   basis, you track it. It's not trivial, but, but it is tractable just to help convince yourself
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.720]   that these buckets are important and you're willing to do work towards those buckets every day
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:17.680]   to give a rhythm of discipline in your life. That's the foundation. Again, if you try to do
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.920]   everything at once, nothing fits through the door. You're stuck. Let's start with just,
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.960]   we have one habit going for each of the buckets. Then you rotate bucket by bucket,
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:31.840]   dedicating four to eight weeks to each. And that's where you do the more serious work of how do I
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:37.040]   overhaul this part of my life? Really changed my routine and habits, my goals, make big moves,
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.880]   and just focus on just that you have the keystone habits as the backdrop for all your other buckets.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.480]   But for the next two months, all I'm thinking about is constitution, my health, my fitness,
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:49.760]   how I eat, working with a trainer, I joined the gym. I let me give myself two months to really
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:53.360]   understand this thing. This part, this part of my life is important. What works, what doesn't,
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.120]   what I really want. Let me get new grooves, new habits, new routines. I don't drink in the week
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:01.760]   anymore. I give up junk food. It takes time and focus to finally get there. And only after that
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:06.000]   settled, you say, okay, let me take a breather. I'm going to spend two months thinking about
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.440]   overwork, overhauling my work life craft, right? So you give things time to give it a lot of focus.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.760]   And when you're doing this for the first, at least two months per bucket is probably important
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:20.960]   going forward. Every couple of years, you probably want to go through this exercise again,
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:25.040]   as you get better at it, three, four weeks, you can probably tune up areas of your life. Hey,
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:29.040]   where am I lagging? Where could I improve? What's not working anymore? It gets a little bit quicker
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:35.440]   after you get more knowledge, more self-knowledge about these parts of your life. So work to bucket
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:39.520]   systems, identify the buckets, crystal clear visions with concrete instantiation, keystone
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:45.600]   habits, then rotate one by one, giving each bucket soul focus as you upgrade that part of your life
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:50.000]   beyond hope. That is a systematic way of building up to a deeper life. And it's better than just
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.320]   throwing a lot of energy at it. You're not beyond hope because you've already done the hardest and
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:07:02.320]   most important step, which is knowing you want more. The rest is just details. All right, let's
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:11.280]   do a one more question here. This one comes from Carl, uh, Karen, who says as an advocate of the
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:17.760]   deep life, I live the principles from deep work, digital minimalism, and a world without email.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:22.560]   To me, this is about living a life, focusing deeply on the things that matter
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:30.160]   and doing so with intention. That said, we live in a world that's not conducive to the deep life.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:35.920]   What would you say would have to happen at a systems level that changes the cultural norms
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:40.720]   of many individuals that steer them towards the deep life and away from the shallow,
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:47.280]   hyperactive hive mind? All right, well, Karen, I think your, your summary of the deep life is good,
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:54.480]   focusing deeply with intention on things that matter. I would add the corollary and not wasting
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:59.200]   time or energy on things that don't really matter. So it's the avoiding the distraction. In addition
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:04.240]   to really focusing on the things that matter. So how do we make culture wide changes there?
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:11.280]   I think it's a two part process. And I see myself as being involved in the first part,
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.960]   but I can't do the second part. So I think the first part is just clarity. I'm a big believer
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:23.280]   in the power of vocabulary, just having a way of actually describing what you don't like, what you
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:28.240]   do like, what you're, you're, what you're going after, what you're trying to avoid. Vocabulary
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:34.320]   makes a big difference. Just a simple term like deep work versus shallow work clarified for a lot
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:38.800]   of people, these otherwise ambiguous feelings of unease they had about their frenetic knowledge,
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.760]   work lifestyle, but they couldn't really put their finger on. I just feel like busy and I'm
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:45.040]   spinning my wheels and things aren't happening. And, and I don't know, am I just like,
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:50.240]   am I being exploited? Do I just not like work? Is it, is it my boss bad as capitalism bad?
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.400]   They couldn't really put their fingers on what this source of this unease was, but, but deep work,
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:58.480]   shallow work, the idea that the mind focusing on one thing at a time that matters is a very
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.800]   different activity than going back and forth between lots of things. That vocabulary provided
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:09.040]   a cognitive scaffolding that clarified a lot of what they're feeling. Digital minimalism, same
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.960]   thing to hyperactive hive mind, trying to capture what's going on with email and Slack. We know
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.800]   email is better than a memo. It's convenient, but why do I hate it? Hyperactive hive mind,
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.720]   we're trying to put a label on the issue. So that's a lot of what I do is trying to bring
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:25.680]   clarity to these issues at the intersection of technology, work, and culture, and how that all
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:31.600]   surrounds meaning. I like to add clarity. Here's what's going on. Here's the forces at play.
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.920]   Here's a term for what what's, what's pure that you might be seeking over here. Here's a term for
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:42.400]   what's giving us unease, clarify the issues, right? It's like heart attacks go up in the 20th
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:46.560]   century in the West. We don't know why or what that means or what causes us. We can't really
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.720]   do anything until science comes along and tries to tell us about arterial plaque. So same thing
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:58.000]   for these other types of issues. Step two, you then need influential people to actually go out
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.840]   there and personify the alternative. So once we understand the issues, what we don't like and what
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:07.040]   we want, you need people who then are using that clear vocabulary or public and people care and
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:13.680]   respect about demonstrating publicly. All right, I'm doing, I'm living in this different way.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:18.240]   You have to actually see the change you want in the world. I'm not influential enough to make a
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:23.840]   huge difference that way, but if very influential people have these clear stands, here's why I don't
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.760]   use social media in this way. And I just use this tool and I don't like Tik Tok. And here's what,
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:34.160]   I am not on Twitter and I, you know, have a wood shop and I focus or whatever. The Nick Offerman's
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.840]   to Brene Brown's, the Anthony Bourdain's, the Elizabeth Gilbert's that are living different,
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:44.960]   deeper focused lives. You need the people out there showing the alternative. If we really crave
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:48.320]   it, we can understand what we crave. We can understand what we're getting away from. And we
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:53.440]   see people actually doing what we want. That's how you get wide scale change.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:59.520]   So I'm just defining words and hoping that the type of people that can define culture
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:03.360]   pick up on those words and by doing so change a lot of minds.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:11.520]   And that is what we have. So we did part one, email part two, the deep life,
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:19.840]   kept it clean, kept it simple. So remember we need your feedback. Go to the survey in the
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:24.560]   description of the show and whatever podcast player you use, go to that survey, give us your
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.600]   feedback about what you like and what you don't like. We're going to keep improving the show,
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.320]   make it more useful to you. And that's how we're going to do it is by getting your feedback.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.000]   And with that, we'll wrap up this week's episode. We'll be back next week. I think I'm solo casting
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.520]   next week. Jesse is away. So be ready for that. If you like what you saw, you will like what you
