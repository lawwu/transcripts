[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   Sheldon writes in to ask, "I would consider myself a Christian hedonist and I'm familiar
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.720]   with the scriptures that extol God's own happiness. However, when I observe God interacting with
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.040]   humans in scripture, such as Jesus in the Gospels, or God with Israel in the Old Testament,
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.280]   He often does not come across as outwardly happy. Am I just reading it wrong? Was Jesus'
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.880]   time on earth just full of hardship? How can I address this seeming disconnect between
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.880]   biblical theology that exclaims God's full unending joy and biblical observations of
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.660]   God in His actions, His speech, His behavior, that seem to show Him as not all that abounding
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.560]   in joy?" Professor John, what do you say?
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.160]   Well, Sheldon, I found this to be one of the most provocative questions I've heard, had
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.000]   in a long time. This really forced me to ponder some things that I hadn't thought of before,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.240]   so thank you. It's just a great example of how asking questions is the key to going deeper
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.480]   in the Bible than what we think. So, I don't know that I have the answer here, but I'll
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:19.100]   tell you what I've been thinking about. Let's start with the truth that we Christians are
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:28.120]   joyful and sorrowful at the same time. 2 Corinthians 6:10, "Sorrowful yet always rejoicing." Even
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:37.360]   though the Bible says, "Rejoice always," and surely God rejoices always, we sorrow often,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.840]   maybe always, because it's always something to be sad about, without losing our joy. Now,
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:53.960]   I think it's this way with God. God can be grieved, Ephesians 4. He's angry, and He sympathizes
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.520]   with the sorrowful, weeps with those who weep, even while laughing at the wicked, Psalm 2,
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:10.280]   and rejoicing over sinners who repent, Luke 15. So, God is very emotionally complex, infinitely
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:19.480]   more so than we are, but we're emotionally complex, too, in His image. So, let me try
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.600]   an analogy of God's peaceful, joyful, Trinitarian happiness. It's like the Pacific Ocean. From
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.400]   a satellite, it is perfectly beautiful and serene and blue. You've seen those pictures,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.180]   the blue planet. It just looks wonderful. But if you're flying in a helicopter 500 feet
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:51.560]   above the waves in a hurricane, the Pacific Ocean is frighteningly and terrifyingly turbulent.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.240]   And that's the way, I think, the mind of God is. Another way to see it is that God sometimes
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.400]   looks at our lives through the narrow lens that focuses on our sin or our pain, and He
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.800]   can be angry or grieved. Jesus looked around on them with anger, grieved at their hardness
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:20.480]   of heart in Mark 3, I think. So, grief and anger happening together. I think God can
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.480]   feel that when He looks through the narrow lens at your life. Or, He can open the lens
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.640]   to the wider aperture and see our sin and our pain in relationship to the whole panorama
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.280]   of His millions of purposes and approve of the tapestry that He's weaving in history,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.720]   including our own pain and sin in it, and thus rejoice over all His works. So, He can
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.600]   be looking through the wide lens and rejoicing, looking through the narrow lens and grieving
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:00.280]   and suffering. And my answer to the question that He's asking is that in the Bible, what
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.240]   we have mainly is a record of God dealing with us in our sin and pain and looking largely
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:13.000]   through the narrow lens. That's what the Bible is. It's between the fall and the consummation
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.040]   where the Bible mostly records God's interaction with man in rebellion, in sin, before the
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:30.160]   final day, which I think accounts for why the tone is so regularly bleak and agonizing
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:39.200]   and struggling and grieving and painful. There are hundreds of glimpses of God's joy
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.400]   and our joy in the age to come when we are done with sinning. But mostly, the Bible is
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.960]   the story of our sinning and God's painful and merciful dealing with it. God enters into
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:01.880]   our pain-filled world in Jesus, and He's called a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.000]   So He's a high priest who can sympathize with us in our sorrows and in our pain. That's
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.800]   what we would expect, is that this man who came into the world precisely to suffer is
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.040]   going to look like a sufferer almost every time we see Him, rather than a person who's
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.680]   chipper all the time, even though He went to parties and they called Him a glutton and
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:37.360]   a wine-bimber. He was sorrowful yet always rejoicing. So it seems to me that the very
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:46.560]   problem that has been raised is a good news problem. God is not distant off in His Trinitarian
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:54.800]   happiness, but is identifying with us in our sorrow. The God we meet in the Bible is a
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   God revealing Himself, not usually as before creation in perfect Trinitarian happiness
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   or after consummation when all sinning is gone and all evil has been put out of the
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:16.200]   universe, but God with us now, agonizing over His recalcitrant bride, Israel in the Old
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:25.040]   Testament and in His Son suffering for us in the New. But I would end my effort to answer
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:32.520]   this question, Tony, by saying, let's not forget all the places, and I have never counted
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.440]   them, but there are a lot, where God Himself reminds us, "The ransomed of the Lord shall
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:45.320]   return and come to Zion with singing. Everlasting joy will be upon their heads. They shall obtain
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.840]   gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing will flee away." And that means not only ours,
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.260]   but God's identification with ours will also flee away, and there won't be any of this
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.160]   kind of cloud hanging over the universe like there is now.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.040]   Yes, and Lord, hasten that day. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to
