[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   I'm back, and today we're going to do a fun one.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.760]   No technical financial planning here today.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.040]   We're just going to talk about minivans and why I believe that your next car should be
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.000]   a minivan, no matter who you are.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:34.680]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.480]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and I'm your host.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.480]   Thank you for being with me.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.360]   Happy to be back after a few weeks away from the microphone.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.040]   I missed you guys.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.040]   I needed a break.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.280]   It was a much needed break, but I did miss you.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.400]   I didn't want to be away that long, but at the end of the day, I needed the break.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.080]   Today, I'm back, excited, energetic, and enthusiastic.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.200]   I think you'll like this one.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.000]   I do welcome you to the show.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.360]   This is the show where I'm dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.440]   encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.760]   for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.080]   We've had a lot of great feedback on those past few episodes that we did on the three-part
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.760]   series discussing the details on that three-part series that is explaining that tagline.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.720]   Last show, how to become financially free in 10 years or less, many of you have gotten
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.360]   great feedback that many of you enjoyed that.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.560]   It's been quite popular, so thank you for that.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.400]   We'll continue to flesh these concepts out and get them into a more actionable form for
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.400]   you than just a podcast.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.160]   Today, we're going to do something fun and talk about minivans.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.480]   This is a subject that's near and dear to my heart.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.960]   In fact, just this weekend, I was with a friend of mine.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.720]   They have one child and we were talking about vehicles and they were saying, "Well, we don't
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.720]   really like our current car."
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.920]   I said, "What are you thinking about buying?"
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.960]   They weren't thinking about buying a minivan.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.840]   Now, of course, in personal relationships, I can't necessarily hop up and down and beat
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.760]   people on the head and say, "Listen, you've got to buy a minivan."
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.000]   That doesn't work very well, but in my podcast, I can.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.080]   Here's the case that I'm going to make to you.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.400]   I believe that each and every one of you should consider, if you don't currently own one,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.600]   should consider buying a minivan as your next vehicle.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.880]   I'm saying that with very few qualifications.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.680]   I will, at the end of the show, get to a couple of the exceptions and talk about some of the
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.920]   exceptions to that, but we're going to start off with a very strong and powerful case for
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.920]   minivans.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   I love my minivan.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.480]   I think that if you could get one, you would love it too.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.600]   Today, I'm going to try to give you the ammunition you need.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.320]   If nothing else, this show will sit here as a resource that the next time I'm having a
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.720]   conversation with a friend of mine who's not considering buying a minivan for some silly
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.760]   reason, I could just point them to this show.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.440]   Before I get into the bulk of the content, two quick things.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.520]   Sponsors of the day number one is me, myself.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.080]   Back from vacation, and I've got some time in the coming weeks.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.200]   Would you like to have some input from me on any particular financial question that
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   you have?
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.720]   Well, I've set up a consulting program where you can actually consult directly with me.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.480]   This will work through a phone call system.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.860]   All the details can be found at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall, but if you'd like my input on your situation,
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.160]   you can book that call with me.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.640]   The way it works is there's a software system that's set up.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.640]   It'll bill you by the minute for the discussion, but I'll show up.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.560]   I'll be happy to read anything in advance that you'd like me to read, an email from
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.560]   you or information.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.560]   I'll show up.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.120]   I'll take notes and ask you some questions about your situation, try to help you.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.720]   The feedback so far has been fantastic.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.480]   So if you'd like to talk to me about a personal financial planning problem or personal financial
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.280]   discussion, please go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall and book a call.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.720]   Now let's talk about minivans.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:04:00.920]   I am fully aware that many people object to minivans on the basis of their style.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.360]   I'm fully aware that many people don't want to drive a mom mobile.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.600]   I get that.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.880]   But this objection is...
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.640]   I'm so tempted to be over the top.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.820]   I have in my notes here, this is so fundamentally silly that it seems like we should hardly
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.120]   need to deal with it.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.880]   Now, at the end of the day, I know that's probably a little bit too strong.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.120]   So let's just say this objection I think is so insignificant compared to the many advantages
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.480]   of minivans that I really think you should consider getting over it.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.520]   But we'll come back to that and deal with it in a moment.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.800]   I want to start with just a few of the features and benefits because I think that not only
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.720]   can a minivan serve as a really compelling financial choice for you, I'm going to defend
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.960]   that to you today, but it can also result and it can also serve as a really compelling
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.980]   lifestyle choice.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.600]   To me, that's the biggest benefit of minivan is a lifestyle choice.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.700]   I think it's probably not the cheapest way to operate a vehicle.
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.300]   But from a lifestyle perspective, it has so many benefits that when you actually incorporate
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.920]   those things, it makes a really, really strong case.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.360]   Now, a few of the features and benefits of a minivan are really, really simple.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.360]   Let's buzz through them.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.000]   Number one, big one, you get a ton of usable seats.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.120]   I recommend if you're shopping for one, do your best to get an eight-seater.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.240]   What that means is that you and seven of your friends can travel your town or travel your
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.400]   country in air-conditioned comfort.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.240]   The seats on these minivans are fantastic.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.720]   They're really, really comfortable.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.960]   They've got tons of space.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.320]   The great thing about a minivan, unlike any SUVs, is that when you actually have people
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.240]   with you, you still have a ton of cargo space.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.720]   If you've not ridden recently in a modern minivan, and by modern minivan, I'm talking
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.520]   newer models of Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, Hyundai Entourage, Kia Sedona, or the Dodge
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.760]   Chrysler Town & Country version, Caravan, etc.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.440]   If you've not been in one of these recently, do yourself a favor and rent one and use it
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.640]   for a few days before you do something else.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.560]   Many times when people are considering a larger car, they're moving up from a smaller car
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.640]   and they know they need a little bit of space.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.600]   The biggest thing I want to point off is to help people to head away from SUVs in this
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.040]   context and help you to move towards a minivan.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.720]   I'm going to be primarily referencing the difference here between SUVs and minivans,
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:37.160]   but I even still think that a good comparison can be made between cars and minivans as well.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.240]   I'm going to get to that in a moment.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.880]   A minivan has so much more space than even the largest of SUVs and most people just simply
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.960]   are not aware of it.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.240]   Let me give you some actual numbers.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:56.080]   2016 Toyota Sienna has 150 cubic feet of cargo space behind the front seats.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.920]   150 cubic feet of cargo space behind the front seats.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.680]   Let's compare that to the two largest SUVs that are on the market right now.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.820]   A 2016 Ford Expedition EL, that's their extra long, the big one, that when they got rid
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.840]   of the Excursion, they added on this Ford Expedition EL.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:22.880]   They added this on, it's got 130.8 cubic feet of space behind the front seats, 20 feet less
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.560]   than the Toyota Sienna.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:32.200]   A 2016 Chevrolet Suburban has 121.7 cubic feet of space behind the front seats.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:39.120]   So a minivan, standard everyday issue minivan has more usable cargo space and interior space
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.280]   behind the front seats than the largest SUVs on the market.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.280]   By the way, I should have mentioned earlier, I've owned cars.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.000]   I've owned a Honda Accord.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.160]   I've owned a Ford Escape.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.080]   I've owned a Ford Expedition.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.000]   Very happy days of my life was when they got rid of the Expedition and transitioned it
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   to a minivan.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.880]   So I come from experience.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.360]   Been through it from experience.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:09.440]   What most people don't realize is that this usable space in a vehicle of a modern minivan
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.400]   is so much better because of the simple design.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.440]   For example, something like a Toyota Sienna or a Honda Odyssey or my Hyundai Entourage,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.680]   the cargo space is lower and you get way better access to it from the sides and from the rear.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.440]   When I used to have the Expedition, one of the biggest problems with SUVs and their fundamental
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.480]   construction is that their back row seats only open out.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.520]   They only open out with the traditional car seats.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.360]   A minivan, you have these giant sliding doors that open back.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.600]   This is a big deal when you're loading cargo in and out.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.960]   This is a big deal when you're trying to access anything that you have in the back.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.080]   And it's a big deal when you're trying to work with kids and kids in car seats.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.640]   If you have kids, I mean, that should be a huge incentive for you.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.480]   But even if you don't, this is still really useful.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.520]   On a minivan, you open up both sides, sliding cargo doors on either side.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.440]   You open up the back hatch, you have a very low load floor.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.760]   You have a really high ceiling.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.040]   You've got fantastic access to the cargo.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.500]   So not only is there more space, but it's much more useful.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.480]   The full-size back hatch on a minivan is more useful in terms of things like rain coverage.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.440]   There have been tons of times from out on a minivan and we use our vehicle.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.080]   That's one of the things that I think you should have a vehicle that you use.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.080]   So you take it out.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.840]   You take it to the beach or you take it out to a picnic.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.680]   Starts raining, you can pop up the back hatch and you can have a party of six people, two
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.400]   people sitting in the back of the vehicle and two or three sitting there underneath
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.600]   the hatch.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.400]   Now one of the best ways to use a minivan is if you're only using a few of the seats.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.560]   So if you only use that middle bench row, you wind up with a fantastic five-seat car,
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.880]   two front seats and three seats in the middle bench row and you have a massive cargo space
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.740]   in the back, which is really, really useful.
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.440]   Now I don't think that you necessarily always have to upgrade your vehicle just when you
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.440]   need some cargo space.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.860]   There are lots of great ways to do it.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.880]   As a simple example, one of our vehicles, I have an old 1998 Toyota Corolla that I bought
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.880]   for $500.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.120]   A few months ago, our minivan was in the shop and so we wound up driving this Corolla for
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.800]   a couple of weeks.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:21.080]   I took my family of four people, two dogs, two adults in the front, two kids in car seats
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.080]   in the back, two dogs.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.520]   We don't have small dogs.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.920]   They're not huge but they're about – one's about 50-pound dogs and two dogs in this tiny
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.880]   little Corolla with two paddle boards strapped to the roof.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.280]   So you can do it.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.360]   But man, is it a lot more comfortable in a minivan.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.560]   And just this cargo space opens up the possibilities.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.520]   A simple thing, talking about the paddle boards, I carry our paddle boards in the vehicle.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.440]   Instead of having to deal with the hassle of strapping them on the roof, suffering poor
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.960]   fuel economy for that, I just pop the back seats down.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.120]   Our middle seat is captain's chairs.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.960]   I slide them right up through the front of the vehicle and you have access to it.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:03.520]   I carry grills and smokers and all kinds of things to all kinds of events and it's so
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.000]   nice to be able to have all of that space.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.240]   One of the reasons why the space is important for us and one of the reasons why I carry
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.840]   a lot of things in different places is even for the perspective of entertaining.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.880]   When we sold our house, we wound up moving into a smaller apartment and the smaller apartment
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.020]   is not quite as conducive to entertaining lots of people as our larger house was.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.400]   But I'm not willing to give up on entertaining people.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.680]   So what I just do is take the show on the road.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.680]   Have a griddle.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.280]   I have a Camp Chef stove, a big three-burner stove that comes with this big, long, about
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.280]   30-inch griddle on the top.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.560]   I can cook 30 pancakes at a time.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.200]   I have tons of chairs and coolers and things like that.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   Load the smoker.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.040]   A friend of mine, a listener of the show, gave me a pit barrel cooker, a smoker.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.840]   I can load that in the back.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.120]   Load all the stuff up in there and then I can take the party on the road and we can
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.640]   have tons of big events but it's not at my house.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.080]   We just go down to the beach and do it at the beach or do it at a local park, things
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.080]   like that.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.640]   It's cheaper than owning a big old house but I still get one of the major benefits of the
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.720]   house which is the entertaining.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.800]   So this cargo room is really, really valuable.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.200]   My wife loves the minivan because she can stop and pick up things off the side of the
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   road.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.120]   We're driving through a place and pick up a free bed or she's gotten a free rocking
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.120]   chair.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.720]   We have a rocking chair in our living room that's probably the kind you'd pay 200 bucks
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.320]   for, a cracker barrel.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.400]   She found it on the side of the road but by having the capacity to just toss it in the
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.400]   car.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.920]   We were out looking at houses and looking for rental houses and kind of driving the
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.920]   neighborhoods and seeing what the neighborhoods were that we wanted to possibly purchase a
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.920]   rental house in.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.520]   We found a table on the side of the road.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.600]   Pop that thing up on the roof.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.240]   It's a 10-foot long table.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.800]   It's in our dining room now.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.480]   So having this space opens up tons of options for you.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.040]   It's not just about where do you strap a car seat.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.800]   It's much more about just having room to move in and we'll come back to that in a moment
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.840]   because we need to take travel and you talk about the ways that you can travel and the
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.880]   ways that you can move and you can camp and you can use.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.040]   It's so nice to have that space.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.800]   Many vans are awesome because they're really, really drivable.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.320]   They're very easy to drive and they're very comfortable to drive because of the design.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.440]   The modern unibody construction is built around drivability.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.440]   It's much more drivable, much more comfortable on the road than the traditional which is
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.000]   much stronger, the traditional body on frame construction of the larger SUVs that they
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   still use.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.800]   The smaller SUVs use the unibody construction as well.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.960]   But minivans are much more solid and enjoyable to drive on the highway than a smaller car.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:35.840]   They're about 4,000 to 5,000 pounds, about 4,400 pounds and so they're much more stable,
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.200]   much more comfortable in high winds and high speeds and speeds in small cars.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.760]   But they're much more drivable than SUVs are.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:50.440]   For example, 2016 Toyota Sienna has a 37.5-foot turning radius.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:57.240]   You could compare that very favorably to a big SUV, a 2016 Ford Expedition EL, again
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.360]   the big one, has a 43.9-foot turning radius.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.080]   So you have about a seven-foot advantage.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.520]   That makes a big difference when you're pulling into parking spaces and doing U-turns, things
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.520]   like that.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.880]   But it even compares more favorably than a small SUV.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.280]   Remember, the Sienna has 37.5-foot turning radius.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:21.200]   A 2016 Ford Escape has a 38.8-foot turning radius.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.840]   So you have this tiny little Escape, used to own an Escape, I've used it a lot, I think
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.680]   it's a useful vehicle, but you have this little tiny Escape versus this minivan.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.000]   The minivan has better turning radius.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   What about fuel mileage?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.520]   Well, a Sienna is rated for 18 miles per gallon in the city, 25 miles per gallon on the highway.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.000]   That same Expedition EL, 15 miles per gallon in the city, 21 on the highway.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.600]   Now, here's where something like a small SUV would come out ahead.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.160]   2016 Escape, 23.32.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.560]   So you have a little bit of an advantage there in fuel mileage from an Escape over a Sienna.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.160]   And that does make a difference.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.800]   You do need to calculate the actual amount that you drive because, and it's one of my
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:09.640]   exceptions, if you are a real road warrior, you're really putting on thousands and thousands
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:16.280]   of miles, then the fuel mileage will make a difference and you should calculate that.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:22.000]   But for many people, the offsetting value and the ability to have a vehicle for a long
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.680]   time, meaning that you buy a minivan and you keep it for a longer period of time because
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.560]   it fits as a family grows, you get dogs, you get stuff, you're moving stuff, you'll make
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.600]   up for the fuel mileage from that perspective.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:41.080]   One thing that's just great about modern vehicles is they're powerful.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:46.960]   A 2016 Sienna has 266 horsepower.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.200]   I like to compare that.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.240]   Now, certainly you can get lots of vehicles that are far more powerful than that, but
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.440]   I like to go back and compare it historically.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:04.880]   A 1995 Ford F-350, one ton pickup truck with the biggest V8 they offer, 7.5 liter V8, that
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:13.200]   vehicle came from the factory with 245 horsepower, 20 horsepower less than a modern 2016 Toyota
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.480]   Sienna with a V6.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.480]   These vehicles are powerful.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.480]   They're cheap to buy.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.480]   They're cheap to insure.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.720]   Many vans have a great insurance cost compared to others because they're generally driven
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.580]   by people who are parents who are probably a little bit more stable.
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.280]   They're cheaper to maintain because there's so many of them out there.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:35.520]   There's tons and tons of benefits to them, especially as compared to an SUV.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:41.480]   From a lifestyle perspective, you'll get far more use and utility from a minivan over an
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.480]   SUV.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.480]   I've owned both.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.840]   I've used both.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.600]   I promise you'll get more utility.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.280]   Now, I think one of the major benefits of a minivan and why I can so confidently state
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.760]   in the title of this show that your next car should be a minivan no matter who you are
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.960]   is simply because they're appropriate at every stage of life.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:10.440]   I think that people forget about how valuable it is to have one vehicle for a long period
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.160]   of time.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:19.400]   The process of buying and selling vehicles is generally extremely inefficient for most
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.400]   people.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.160]   Now, there are some of you who are quite radical and I love the fact that you do it who will
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.840]   go out and you buy an old car and you'll fix it up and you'll own it and drive it for a
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:31.120]   year and then sell it and sell it for more than you pay for.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.200]   I think that's awesome.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.640]   There are some of you who will be able to make money on your cars through that process.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:42.080]   I have a family member who's a car dealer and he makes money on every car he drives,
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.400]   just drives for free.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.880]   You could do that on a little space.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.600]   For example, some of you, a good part-time business should get your auto dealer license
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.960]   and go and buy a couple of cars and sell them out of the front yard.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.620]   You can do that, but most people don't and most people aren't going to.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:02.240]   It's not a skill set that I'm particularly interested in working with right now.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.000]   The process of buying and selling vehicles is very expensive.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.260]   The friction, the cost of finding a good one, the cost of inspections if you're buying a
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.440]   used one, the cost of taxes.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.040]   In the state of Florida, we pay sales tax on a vehicle.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.520]   There's a 6% cost every time you will go and register a vehicle.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.080]   The process of changing titling and things like that.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:27.280]   There are always transaction costs that have to be accounted for.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.640]   The other thing is the cost of depreciation.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.360]   Many people, when they're consistently upgrading vehicles, and this is what most US Americans
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.380]   do, is they're consistently upgrading their vehicle every few years.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:43.640]   They're often driving a vehicle at the most expensive part of the curve of depreciation.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.960]   They're moving up and they're buying a $20,000 vehicle and if your $20,000 vehicle is depreciating
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:55.280]   at 15%, you're losing $3,000 that year on the cost of depreciation.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:02.080]   If your $20,000 vehicle becomes a $10,000 vehicle after about three, four, five years
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.320]   and you turn around and sell a vehicle for $10,000, you trade up again to a $20,000,
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:14.400]   you're always operating that vehicle in a very expensive part of the depreciation curve.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.240]   That adds up.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.080]   Especially when you add on those friction costs of changing ownership, that adds up.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.160]   Also when you add on the cost when you buy a vehicle, and again for a moment I'm assuming
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.080]   you're buying a used one, you buy a used vehicle, what do you need to do?
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   You need to do a tune-up.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.960]   You need to make sure that all the maintenance was done.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.240]   You change the oil, you change the belt, you change the hoses, you change all this stuff.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:40.920]   In a modern world where the average vehicle can easily go 200,000 miles with minimal repairs,
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.720]   and many of them can go much beyond that, there's no need to constantly be trading out
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:51.280]   your vehicle every three or four years except for lifestyle changes.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.840]   This is often what happens.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.680]   Many people start looking at a minivan when they are thinking about when they have kids
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.280]   or they go from one kid to two kids.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.520]   I'll tell you, putting kids in and out of car seats of a little Toyota Corolla is a
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.520]   pain.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.520]   I do it.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.160]   It's a pain.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.560]   So people start looking around and then all of a sudden you start trading up.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.400]   This trading process is very, very expensive both because of the depreciation curve and
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.680]   because of the friction of buying and selling.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.320]   So I recommend to you that in order to stem the financial outflow, in order to stop hemorrhaging
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.440]   money from your life with vehicles, it's good to buy a vehicle that's going to serve you
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.320]   for a long time and own it for a long time.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.040]   Even if some of you buy a new vehicle.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:38.320]   I was doing a consulting call with somebody recently on the phone line, radicalpersonalfinance.com/phonecall.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.080]   They were asking, they had bought some new vehicles, they were a few years old, and they
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.600]   were asking, "Do you think that we should sell them?"
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.600]   They were trying to get out of debt.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.600]   They said, "Do you think we should sell our vehicles?"
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.520]   I asked about the vehicles and number one, "Do you like the vehicles?"
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.520]   "Yes, we like them."
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.040]   Number two, "What type of vehicles are they?"
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.720]   They were vehicles that could fit their lifestyle for a long period of time.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.840]   I said, "Your best thing at this point in time is just to keep them.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.160]   If you've bought a new car, that's done.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.680]   Now you got to make a fresh decision.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.800]   You bought a new car.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.560]   Now you've owned it from the factory.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.040]   Hopefully you've stayed current on all of your maintenance costs and things like that.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.480]   You know what's gone on with the vehicle.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.480]   You know it wasn't buried in water in Hurricane Sandy.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.680]   You know that it's been cared for."
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.120]   Well, in that case, in order to minimize the cost, just keep the vehicle for a very long
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.640]   period of time.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:28.040]   If you can own a vehicle for 20 years, your cost of depreciation becomes a very small
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.320]   cost as compared to everything else.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.040]   If you keep a vehicle for a short period of time, depreciation is a much bigger expense
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.240]   that you've got to plan for.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:40.360]   When you're thinking about how do I set myself up logically, buy a vehicle that you're going
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.440]   to own for a long period of time.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.760]   I think a minivan is the perfect vehicle for high school students to drive.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.560]   I really do.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.200]   I think a minivan is, if you're working with your high school student or if you are a high
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.760]   school student, you should look into buying a minivan.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.760]   Why?
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.320]   Well, first of all, in high school, if you're driving in high school, many of your friends
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.200]   don't have driver's license.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.660]   How great is it to have a vehicle where you can eight-seat minivan, you can load up seven
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.140]   of your friends and travel around with them?
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.140]   How cool is that?
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.420]   You're the most popular person around.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:16.380]   You can move people instead of only being able to fit two or three people into your
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.140]   little tiny car.
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:22.980]   Minivans are great because they can be filled up with stuff and used for adventures.
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.920]   To me, one of the biggest benefits and I see people, the first inclination that people
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.300]   make when they're young is buy a little car.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.840]   Little car is good for gas mileage, but truly, how much do you actually commute?
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.380]   Are you really putting 20,000 miles a year on a car, on a little car?
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.340]   Most people aren't versus using it.
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.820]   You give me a minivan, I'll load up four or five of my friends and we got massive space
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:49.980]   in the back for stuff to take a great trip, stuff to go take adventures with going rock
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.940]   climbing or going surfing or going traveling and we need a place for tents and coolers
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.320]   and all that stuff.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.660]   That cargo space is really useful.
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.740]   A high school student, you get a minivan, you can fill it up with stuff for your adventures.
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.660]   The great thing is minivans get the best safety ratings.
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:09.180]   Now, there are other vehicles that get the best safety ratings as well, but you get the
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.020]   benefit of having a large vehicle.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.140]   Many people want a large vehicle.
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.380]   They want to put their high school student in a tiny little car.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.700]   You get the benefit of a large vehicle.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:25.180]   It has five-star safety ratings across the board, most of them.
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.700]   It's not built for hot-rodding.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.140]   It's not a muscle car.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.660]   It avoids many of those problems.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:35.580]   It's much safer than an SUV in terms of the likelihood of it being flipped on the highway.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.620]   It has a lower center of gravity.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.940]   It's just a much safer vehicle.
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.140]   They get great safety ratings, perfect for high school students.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.820]   What about college students and young adults?
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:49.140]   I think a minivan is the perfect vehicle for a young adult or college student because one
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.620]   of the features of this stage of life is often a lot of moving.
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.620]   Minivan not only works for all those things that I just said for a high school student
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.780]   like taking your friends around, but it works great for moving.
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.880]   You can pack that thing full.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.220]   Lower the seats, all flattened to the floor.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.220]   You have a huge amount of cargo space.
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.020]   You can move easily and transition.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.700]   Works really, really well for all those adventures.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.500]   One of the great things about a minivan is that you can easily, very, very comfortably
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.380]   camp in the back of it while you're traveling.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:23.820]   I've camped in the back of, let's see, a Ford Escape, Ford Expedition, minivan, Hyundai
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.940]   Entourage, and also Toyota Prius.
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.940]   Those are the four different types of cars that I've actually camped in the back of.
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.900]   Of all of them, minivan is definitely the most comfortable.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.980]   Well, let's say that you're a young person and you're into traveling.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:41.100]   You just toss a mattress or a mattress pad in the back of the thing and you've got tons
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.060]   of room for stuff slid up against the side.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.940]   You've got a great place to be in out of the weather.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.940]   You need air conditioning.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:47.940]   You just run the air conditioning.
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:48.940]   I've calculated it out.
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.220]   It probably costs you about, depending on the vehicle, it costs you about maybe six
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.180]   bucks of fuel to run the AC all night on the vehicle.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.540]   It's a lot cheaper than a hotel stay.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.060]   Pull over on the side of the road and camp in the back of it.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.900]   Just from the perspective of adventures and the ability to go and to do and to travel
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:09.980]   and to experience many of the things of life, a minivan is the perfect road trip vehicle.
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.340]   You can take more people.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.140]   You can always add in more people.
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.500]   You can easily put two.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.180]   I've seen it one time.
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:23.060]   We did a – one time, it was one of the last flights of the space shuttle.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.380]   This was one of the first times I was pretty young.
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.940]   We decided to go up to Cape Canaveral and watch the space shuttle take off.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:35.100]   I rigged up the minivan to sleep a bunch of my friends and took out all the seats, popped
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.780]   the other seats forward, laid out a bunch of foam padding on the back and I think that
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.780]   – I can't remember.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:43.300]   I think three or four – we had three or four girls that went in there and slept in
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.300]   there.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.900]   It worked great, super comfortable.
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:51.820]   One of the best features – oh, also, on this perspective, things like work.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.980]   Minivans are great work vehicles.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.900]   They can easily be used to carry tools.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.540]   They can easily be used to carry people.
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.580]   Minivans are perfect work vehicles.
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.820]   I look at a lot of tradesmen and people around me and I know it's the same in the rest
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:04.820]   of the country.
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.740]   Many, many tradesmen, the standard answer is to drive a pickup truck.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:15.100]   A pickup truck, unless you need the open back for hauling and unless you need the weight
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.140]   ratings of the vehicle, the ability to really load it up, pickup truck is the worst vehicle
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.820]   ever.
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.980]   All of your stuff is exposed to the weather.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:29.540]   It's crazy inefficient and you have no good place to put tools.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.540]   You got a pickup truck and what's the thing?
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.540]   You put this toolbox.
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.540]   You got the toolbox in the back.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.620]   You put this stupid aluminum toolbox in the back that has very little actual cargo space
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.860]   for your tools.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.860]   Get a minivan and strap down a couple of nice toolboxes in the back.
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.660]   You get a low load floor.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.900]   You get much easier to get in and out of, much easier to haul things, much more practical
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.300]   unless you need the weight ratings, which I'll get back to.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.900]   I'm a realist.
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.500]   Some people do need the weight ratings.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.420]   So minivans are great for work, for work vehicles.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.340]   This can be really, really useful, especially for somebody like a college student or somebody
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.900]   who's living a more transient lifestyle.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:14.140]   You may be able to use the cargo capacity of your vehicle to actually store your stuff
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.140]   in.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:19.980]   For example, one of the things that I would do if I were in that phase of life is I would
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:25.020]   minimize my living expenses and I would try to store things like my tools or some of my
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.380]   gear in the actual vehicle.
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:32.660]   That way I don't have to spend quite so much on having a storage place for it.
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.660]   Super useful.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:37.820]   Now, one of the other great things about it at this stage of life, most people who are
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:42.820]   going through this stage of life are interested in attracting a potential spouse.
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:47.300]   Minivan is the perfect vehicle for you to drive because it helps weed out all the undesirable
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.300]   spouses.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.780]   If you're a young man, minivan is the perfect vehicle for you to drive because it weeds
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:57.620]   out all the undesirable women who are just looking for somebody who's flashy and sporty
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:05.180]   and trying to figure out and say, "Well, where's the guy that drives the nicest car?"
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:10.500]   That type of approach will help you to find somebody who is a little bit more practical
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.660]   and who appreciates somebody who values thriftiness and practicality and who's family-oriented
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.740]   and who's using their equipment for adventure.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.820]   Somebody who doesn't recognize the fact that you're frugal and you're careful and you're
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.940]   wise with your expenditure, somebody who's just looking at admiring the flashiness of
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:34.780]   your presentation with a muscle car or whatever your thing is, that's often a difficult person
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:39.500]   to satisfy down the road.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.180]   Same exact thing goes the other way.
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.700]   Minivans would be a great vehicle for a young woman to drive because it conveys the right
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:49.940]   message to a young man about an orientation towards intelligent, thoughtful planning,
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:55.940]   an orientation towards family, towards practicality instead of an orientation towards flash and
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.260]   consumption.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.540]   Talk to people who've been married a little while and all of a sudden you find that some
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:07.440]   of these deeper character qualities make a much bigger difference in your relational
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:14.260]   happiness over the long term.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:20.260]   Much better to be in a relationship with somebody who values the same things as you than to
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:26.540]   be in a relationship with somebody who's looking for something that you don't want to provide.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:32.940]   If you are interested and you're trying to portray a high status, high consumption lifestyle
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.300]   and put yourself out there as, "Look, notice me because I drive this beautiful fancy new
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:42.220]   sports car," go for it, but you're not listening to the show.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.440]   That type of person generally wouldn't even click on the title of this.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.700]   But when you get to something like, "Hey, I'm building financial independence," or,
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:53.700]   "I'm trying to save money to invest and I'm trying to be practical and wise with my money
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.820]   so that I can pursue financial freedom so that I can have money to invest in my lifestyle
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:06.540]   and the things that matter," having a vehicle whose sex appeal is limited is probably a
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.140]   good way to weed somebody out.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.820]   I had no problem going and driving a sweet car with my wife.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:14.820]   I think it's fun.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:19.300]   You know, borrow a Corvette from somebody or rent a fun car and go and take it out.
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.300]   That's awesome.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.660]   That's fun for an experience.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:27.020]   But if my wife expected that on a daily basis, that would be really, really stressful.
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:33.660]   It'd be really stressful to our finances.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:42.300]   So consider a minivan as the ideal vehicle to drive because of how it portrays you as
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:46.340]   an intelligent, thoughtful person.
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:52.060]   Now with the 20% of the audience that I still have listening to this show, let's talk about
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.180]   other stages of life, families with kids.
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.540]   Now, this is obviously where minivans are tailor-made for.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:01.460]   A minivan is perfect because it allows you to have a great place for your kids and all
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:04.260]   of their stuff and it's so, so useful.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:10.060]   It's amazing the amount of stuff that we wind up having for kids and it's really, really
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.060]   incredible.
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:16.660]   I don't need to labor on this point simply because most of you are aware of that.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:22.340]   But if you are a parent and you haven't at least tried a minivan, when you think about
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:30.420]   the practicality of vehicles, they are really, really useful.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.740]   But I think even for people who are older people without children, a minivan is perfect
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.740]   for older people.
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.740]   It's easy to get in and out of.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.180]   It has a low load floor.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.180]   It's useful.
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.020]   It's comfortable.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:45.780]   So basically, my point with these life stages is simply that a minivan is one of the most
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.420]   useful vehicles that you can have for a very long time.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:55.060]   When I think about vehicles, I primarily think in terms of function and in terms of how does
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.860]   this complement my fleet.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:58.860]   What does this do?
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:05.860]   A minivan, I think, is the most versatile, most useful vehicle for most people in their
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:10.100]   fleet because it does something that crosses all the boundaries.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:15.340]   It's useful in many, many situations.
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:20.700]   When we were moving about a year ago, I used the minivan as a – I was hauling a trailer
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.700]   with it.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:27.220]   I also used the minivan for all of the interior capacity and I used the minivan for its roof.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.380]   That's the kind of thing that you can't do with a car.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.100]   I had lots of weather-protected interior space.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.460]   I had the entire thing full because I was cleaning out the old house and it was things
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.620]   I hadn't yet dealt with.
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.060]   So I had the entire interior of the vehicle full.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:44.860]   I had a big trailer loaded on the back that was also full and again, stuff strapped all
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:45.860]   over the roof.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.860]   Now, it looked a little bit unsightly.
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:53.660]   It looked a little bit like I was moving but I was moving and it was useful.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.380]   Then once you get all that stuff cleared out, you load up the family and you have useful
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.820]   – it's a useful vehicle, very, very useful.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.260]   Now what are the exceptions to this?
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:07.220]   Who should consider not getting a minivan?
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:13.760]   Well, if you're a serious, serious road warrior and the bulk of your miles are just
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.940]   a commuting miles, then I think you should seriously consider getting something that's
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:19.940]   much more fuel-efficient.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.380]   In that case, you should buy a Toyota Prius.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.580]   That shows for another day.
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:29.500]   I'm convinced it's the best vehicle all around, economical to drive, economical to
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.420]   own, incredibly useful.
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:35.460]   It bears – by the way, the reason it's so useful is because it has some of the attributes
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.520]   of a minivan, the ability to fold down the seats, the ability to have lots of cargo space.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.140]   You can tow a small trailer if you need to.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.860]   It wrecks your gas mileage but it's – and it's economical to own.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.780]   It gets great safety ratings, et cetera.
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.580]   So Prius, we'll save that lecture for another day.
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:53.660]   If you need to buy a car, you should seriously consider buying a Prius.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:58.420]   They're fantastic and because they're basically ubiquitous at this point, there's
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.940]   a good selection of them out there.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.420]   There's a good infrastructure for parts and repairs.
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:09.340]   They're – across all of the ratings, they're incredibly reliable.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.740]   They're incredibly well-built.
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:14.060]   There's my sales pitch on Prius.
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:18.460]   But if you're a serious road warrior, you should consider something more fuel-efficient.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:27.740]   For many people, the actual cost of driving, the actual fuel mileage is not the biggest
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.740]   factor.
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.740]   It is a factor but it's not the biggest factor.
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.380]   Let's do some quick math.
[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:38.020]   10,000 miles driven and let's say that you're going to have a difference of 5 miles per
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.580]   gallon in your calculation.
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.380]   So you're looking at a vehicle and one vehicle gets you 5 miles per gallon more.
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:50.420]   So an example here would be the difference between an Escape and a minivan.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:54.220]   So 10,000 miles divided by 5 is – all right.
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:58.140]   We got to do it the long way.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:03.180]   So 10,000 miles driven divided by 25 miles per gallon means you're going to put 400
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.380]   gallons of fuel into a vehicle.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:10.180]   10,000 miles driven by 500 gallon divided by – excuse me, divided by 20 miles per
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:14.140]   gallon means you're going to put 500 gallons of fuel into a vehicle.
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:19.780]   So the difference between 20 miles per gallon and 25 miles per gallon of cumulative driving
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.100]   is 100 gallons of fuel.
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:29.420]   Now the 100 gallons of fuel, let's say you're paying $2.50 per gallon, is going to be $250.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:33.820]   So there will be an increase of cost of $250.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:38.100]   However, calculate out the cost of the insurance.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.220]   Many vans really shine compared to many vehicles because of the lower cost of insurance.
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.940]   Calculate out the cost of maintenance.
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:51.420]   For example, if you buy a four-wheel drive SUV or pickup truck or let's say you buy
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.300]   something with a diesel, you're going to have higher maintenance cost.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.200]   $250 disappears pretty quickly there.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.120]   Calculate out the cost of depreciation.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:06.020]   If you can own one vehicle and you can avoid a $3,000 – instead of buying a $20,000 vehicle
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:11.500]   and upgrading continually like I said in the upgrade cycle and experiencing that $3,000
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:19.300]   drop in depreciation by paying an extra $250 for fuel, you can work – these things can
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.840]   work out much better.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.760]   So my point is not to say that you shouldn't consider fuel economy but simply to say that
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.920]   you should factor it into everything else.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.400]   So if you are a serious, serious road warrior, you should consider owning something else.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:38.680]   If you already have a minivan, it wouldn't generally make sense to buy another one.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:43.080]   Only there is where you should get a more fuel-efficient vehicle.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:47.680]   I love fuel efficiency but when I put onto – even when I talked about those earlier
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:52.720]   life stages, high school student, you're a college student, young adult, when you have
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.640]   a vehicle that you can take on the road and you can pull over on the side of the road
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:59.920]   and for the cost of $6 of fuel, idling the vehicle and having air conditioning all night,
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.760]   you can avoid a $50 hotel stay.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:08.880]   All of a sudden now, it becomes much more compelling to have that capability than the
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.500]   fuel-efficient vehicle.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:15.500]   But if you already have that capability in a minivan in your family, then you should
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.280]   consider going ahead and getting a more fuel-efficient vehicle.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.680]   People who shouldn't consider getting a minivan, if you have more kids than can fit
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.080]   in a minivan, you should probably trade up.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.080]   That's fairly obvious.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.360]   I mean it's five or six kids.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.760]   If you have more than five or six kids, time to trade up.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.920]   If you need a high clearance vehicle and this is where minivans don't do so well, some
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:40.720]   people have a legitimate need for a high clearance, high ground clearance, actual four-wheel drive
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.160]   vehicle.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:46.100]   In that situation, you live at the top of a mountain on an unimproved road and you get
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.400]   snow and you've got to get up the mountain in the snow.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.920]   So you need an actual legitimate four-wheel drive and high ground clearance.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.840]   Well, in that situation, you need to go to an SUV.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.680]   An SUV is going to be able to deliver that.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.680]   A minivan can't.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:04.440]   You can get an all-wheel drive minivan, although most people I don't think it's generally
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.440]   necessary.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.680]   I don't live in the north but from all of my research, it would indicate that the tires
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:13.560]   that you have on your vehicle are a far bigger deal than your all-wheel drive nature of a
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.560]   vehicle.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.040]   Better to have a two-wheel drive vehicle that has great tires than have an all-wheel drive
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.540]   vehicle that doesn't have great tires.
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.960]   Tires are what help you stop.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.800]   All-wheel drive only helps you go.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   In most situations, the need for the all-wheel drive could probably be avoided by many people.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:39.160]   Now, obviously there are exceptions to that but that's been at least my research.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.600]   But you can't get an all-wheel drive minivan.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.040]   The Sienna offers it.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.800]   If you need a higher weight rating than a minivan can handle, then that's where you're
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.240]   definitely going to need to move up to something different.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.760]   Whether that's because you're hauling heavy cargo, whether that's because you're hauling
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:57.520]   lots of people, this is where tradespeople, when you have heavy tools and heavy equipment
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.520]   comes into play.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:03.200]   Then also, if you need to tow a bigger trailer, then that's where you need to move up from
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.200]   a minivan.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.800]   However, I think you'd be surprised.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:11.960]   Generally, the minivans are rated to tow a trailer of about 3,500 pounds with a tongue
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.940]   weighting usually around 400 pounds of tongue weighting.
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:20.720]   You can haul a lot of trailers that are under 3,500 pounds.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.360]   You can haul a small boat.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.740]   You can haul something like a small pop-up camping trailer.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:30.960]   They make these ultra-light, small, non-pop-up camping trailers that can be hauled.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.880]   They're under 3,500 pounds.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.560]   You can haul a landscaping trailer.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.960]   Instead of having a pickup truck, my dad always just had a trailer.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.560]   Far more useful to have a trailer than a pickup truck.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.020]   You do all the same things that a pickup truck can do but you can lend it to your friends
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.020]   much more easily.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.800]   You don't have to pay for an extra drive train.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.800]   You just buy the thing.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:53.120]   Yes, you got to pay for an extra tag but it's a lot less hassle to have an extra trailer
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.800]   around than a pickup truck.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.080]   You can hook the trailer up to the minivan.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:03.040]   You can hook the trailer up to a larger van, even to some cars and it's very, very useful.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.960]   Plus trailer is much more practical than a pickup truck for loading.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.200]   You get a much lower load floor.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.920]   You get an actual so it's easier to get stuff into it.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.560]   You get an actual ramp.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:18.280]   It's just all around superior to a pickup truck when it actually comes to carrying cargo.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:23.440]   If you need to tow a bigger trailer and you need to tow a lot of people, then you should
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.080]   consider an SUV.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:30.240]   However, at that point in time, you probably still shouldn't consider an SUV unless you
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:35.720]   need really great 4x4 high ground clearance because a full-size van is going to be a better
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:41.280]   solution for you in that situation than is an SUV.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.640]   I don't hate SUVs.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:47.600]   I just find them to be completely impractical and I don't understand why everyone thinks
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.440]   that an SUV is the best vehicle ever.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:56.040]   The only thing I can see in SUV is if you need to haul seven people and a big horse
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:02.080]   trailer and you need high clearance 4x4, well then in that case, you need a Suburban.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:08.600]   But just about every other solution I can come up with, some other design is superior.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:15.260]   If you're looking at the small SUVs, a station wagon is in many cases a superior solution
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:19.840]   to a small SUV or a minivan is a more superior solution to a small SUV.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:25.400]   The larger SUVs, a minivan is usually a better solution or a full-size van is a better solution.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.200]   So I don't hate SUVs.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.980]   They just don't make a lot of practical sense.
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.160]   So why do people run to them?
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.520]   Well, it's about image.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.500]   Let's talk about image because image does matter.
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:44.880]   This is obviously the fundamental problem that many people have with minivans.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:51.640]   I don't see how you could have a problem with all the practical things that I talked about.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:55.560]   My wife, she always hated my expedition because she had to step up on the running board.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.560]   She loves the minivan.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.560]   She can just sit down.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.280]   It's a lot easier to get into.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:05.480]   So when we talk about objections and things like that, I don't see how they can be practical
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.480]   objections.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.320]   They're related to image.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.200]   So here are some thoughts that you should consider.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.600]   How important is image really?
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.160]   And what is the image that you're portraying going to do to you?
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.720]   I'll concede that image will make a difference in many things.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:31.720]   The way that people perceive you is going to make a difference in how they treat you.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:36.240]   For example, I give my example where I probably lost 80% of the audience because I just think
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.240]   I'm crazy.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.280]   I mentioned that young men and women of marriageable age should consider the image that they're
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.520]   trying to convey.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.120]   But I mean it.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:50.600]   I don't consider driving a vehicle with a lot of sex appeal to be the primary basis
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.600]   of vehicle selection.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.360]   I view it as a liability.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:58.240]   And in most areas of image, if you think about it, you might agree with me.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:03.240]   It's a liability because it's something – you're portraying something that you might want to
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.840]   change in the future.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:11.680]   And it sets you up over a lifetime of trying to maintain this idea of I'm going to project
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.160]   sex appeal.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:21.480]   Interestingly, I mean in that situation, the body of your own physical human body is probably
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.640]   going to make a bigger difference than the physical body of the car that you drive when
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.880]   you're trying to convey an image.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.600]   But image does make a difference.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:37.360]   And so if you are incredibly insecure and you lack the security to drive a minivan,
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.880]   then perhaps you should consider driving something else.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.640]   But it would be a lot cheaper for you to fix the underlying fundamental problem, the problem
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:52.000]   with your self-image, than to go out and constantly buy a new car to try to feed your problems
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   with self-worth.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.560]   I'm not saying that everybody who doesn't drive a minivan doesn't have self-worth.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.800]   If you want to drive a different vehicle, go ahead.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.840]   I'm just saying that for many people, this is their problem.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.880]   I always found – I always like driving a van or a big vehicle because I always found
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.600]   I could have more fun, have more friends.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:15.200]   In college, there wasn't a time that either me or my best friend didn't have a full-size
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.160]   SUV or a full-size van.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:21.720]   When you talk about the ability to have adventures, I always preferred to be the kind of person
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.920]   who would load up five or six people in their vehicle and be able to go and have some fun
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.960]   than to be able to fit one other person in the seat of my sports car.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:33.040]   By the way, I also faced this other problem that I can't actually fit in many of the
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.360]   smaller cars.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.400]   So a larger vehicle is kind of important for me.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.880]   What about things like sales, etc.?
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:45.000]   I think many people – meaning what about occupations where you need to project a certain
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   image?
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.840]   I think a minivan is something you should consider because it's one of those just
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.000]   in-between vehicles.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.120]   Most people just don't think much about them.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.920]   You can avoid the problems of perception in a couple of ways.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:04.000]   You can avoid it by meeting the problem head-on and displaying something directly or you can
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.400]   just avoid it by getting into something where people aren't going to notice.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.480]   So I think a minivan can work great.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:17.960]   The same way that a full-size SUV or a vehicle like a Prius or some of these in-between vehicles
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:23.360]   can avoid any negative perception, a minivan can work great.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.960]   Now is it perceiving you as the salesman of the year?
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.960]   No.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.800]   If you're running an MLM company and you've got to convince everybody that you're making
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.680]   so much money, well, you better go out and lease a fancy new sports car so that you can
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:39.200]   put your company's logo on the back and that way you can bamboozle everybody into
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.160]   thinking that you're making lots of money when you're actually not.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.960]   But if you don't have a need to do that and to scam people by displaying your flashiness,
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.880]   consider a minivan.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:55.360]   Image and worrying about image can put you right into the poorhouse.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:58.160]   I think it's a major character weakness.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.400]   Now I'm not accusing those of you who say, "I'm a motorhead.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.280]   I want to drive a car that I like or have an enthusiast."
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.280]   Fine.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.340]   If that's your thing, cool.
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:11.660]   But many people just have this weakness, this character weakness of considering what other
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:18.880]   people think and allowing what other people think to be the primary driver of their decisions.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:23.840]   I think it's good to tackle this head-on as a character weakness.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.640]   Now when dealing with a character weakness, there might be a point in time that you need
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.400]   to indulge it.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.400]   Great.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:37.280]   But that shouldn't be a lifestyle because you will never, ever be able to meet up to
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:41.260]   other people's expectations of you.
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:49.640]   If you are worried about how other people perceive you based upon what you drive, it's
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:53.480]   possible that you're also going to be worried how other people perceive you based upon where
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:59.280]   you live and based upon what you wear and based upon what you do.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.640]   It's a recipe for failure, for misery.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:08.600]   It's a recipe for misery because you will always fail.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:13.840]   Think a little bit more.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:20.880]   Think a little bit more deeply and consider if there's a way to tackle it in a different
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.880]   way.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.760]   I think weaknesses and self-worth things, self-worth problems and the way that you perceive
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:30.400]   you is – those things can be changed.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:35.960]   I see driving a minivan as an expression of intelligence for all of those practical reasons
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:40.000]   that I just mentioned.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.480]   Hope it doesn't sound like I think I'm better than you.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:47.080]   I just think like when you actually look at the usefulness of a vehicle and you say – and
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:52.040]   you weigh all of those factors that I mentioned and you compare them based upon, "Well,
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:55.320]   I don't want to look like I'm driving a mom mobile."
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:48:01.040]   Seems a little silly to me to worry too much about driving a mom mobile.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.040]   Your mileage may vary.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.920]   Hopefully, at least this sparked a little bit of conversation for you, a little bit
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.440]   of thoughtfulness for you.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:12.740]   I love to see people be happy with their decisions.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:19.280]   If any of you have ever bought a minivan and hated it and gone back to an SUV – because
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.320]   I guess that's really the focus of this show.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.840]   I would love to know about that.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.480]   I've never met anybody who was in that situation.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.540]   But feel free.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:30.280]   Come by the show page at RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.280]   Comment and let me know why.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.000]   I would love to know why.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   But there's my little diatribe against minivans.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.920]   Hopefully, that was a fun show for you in coming back here after a few weeks of being
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:39.920]   away.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.800]   Thank you all for being patient with me.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.960]   I needed a break.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.680]   It's always hard when you're running a business to schedule the break.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:49.680]   I felt guilty much of the time that I was away.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.680]   But I did need the break.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:51.680]   So back at it now.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.720]   That's it for today's show.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:58.560]   Tomorrow's show is – I was going to tease it but I can't remember what show I scheduled
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.560]   it for.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.200]   I think I scheduled it on lowering the cost of college.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.920]   So that should be tomorrow's show, an interview on lowering the cost of college.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.480]   I hope you'll be back with me to do that.
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.680]   If I can serve any of you in any way, I'd be happy to serve you with a consulting call.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.480]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall to book a phone call with me.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:19.480]   Also, I'd be happy to – if you would like to support the show directly, please consider
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:26.040]   becoming a patron of the show, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:30.640]   Also today was the first time that I went ahead and live streamed the show online on
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:31.640]   YouTube.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:34.400]   One of the things that I worked on was to improve that.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.640]   So thank you to those of you who are watching on YouTube.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.200]   I haven't perfected the technology.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.200]   Today was the first test.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.880]   But feel free to come by and check out the YouTube channel.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:46.640]   It's like YouTube.com/c/RadicalPersonalFinance, something like that.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:50.720]   Primarily, there's just been audio of past shows up there, but I intend to be live streaming
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:55.560]   the show more and more, at least when I'm doing it from my home office.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:56.560]   Thank you all for listening.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:07.560]   Be back with you soon.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.140]   (upbeat music)
