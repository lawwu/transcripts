[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.340]   Well, these are two questions.
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.380]   My answer to question number one will be rather limited.
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.900]   My answer to question two will be more expansive.
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.020]   The first question is,
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.320]   "What are your predictions about the future developments
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.140]   "or changes in filial responsibility laws?"
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.580]   Short version is, I don't have any predictions.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.500]   I don't know very much about them.
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.060]   It's my understanding that filial responsibility laws
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.700]   are laws that exist in something
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.220]   like half of the United States.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.040]   I don't know about international,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.340]   how many countries around the world
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.140]   have these kinds of laws.
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.940]   But a filial responsibility law is a law that requires,
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.340]   using the power of the court,
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.940]   requires children, especially children with resources,
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.900]   to care for parents or other family members
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.460]   if those other family members are destitute,
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.420]   don't have the money to care for themselves,
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.460]   so they don't become a burden on the state.
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.300]   And that's about as far as my knowledge goes.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.860]   These laws do exist.
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.860]   What is unclear to me is basically
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.620]   how widely enforced these kinds of laws are
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.140]   and what the practical impact of them is.
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.760]   In my own home state of Florida,
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.100]   these laws do not exist.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.140]   And I just don't know how widely used they are
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.580]   in the states that have these on the books.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.940]   And so I can't comment on that.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.700]   And I couldn't find any information
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.260]   in thinking about or looking for that
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.740]   that really gave me any kind of insight to it.
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.740]   So I'm not gonna comment on what I think will
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.220]   or won't happen from a legal perspective.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.380]   It would seem to me that at this point in time,
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.020]   we have a couple of trends,
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.220]   but, and those trends are opposing.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.700]   So the reason that you're asking the question is,
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.060]   well, we have aging population.
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.420]   What are we gonna do if all of our old people are destitute?
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.220]   Well, that's true, but there's also a cultural trend
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.740]   towards intense autonomy,
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.400]   where basically people believe that
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.840]   they should be able to do what they want,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.020]   when they want, how they want,
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.100]   with whom they want in any way whatsoever.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.460]   And anything that infringes in any way
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.460]   on them doing what they want
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.460]   doesn't seem to be acceptable in the common culture.
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.140]   And so it's hard for me to see
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.020]   any kind of democratic system at the moment
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.780]   where significant levels of support
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.180]   would emerge for politicians who are promoting those laws
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.940]   and trying to change that.
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.000]   So I couldn't see anything significant changing there
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   without a good lot of convincing from that perspective.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.880]   I support the idea of filial responsibility laws.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.660]   I think that laws and actions that require parents
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.040]   to care for their children are right
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.760]   and just and appropriate.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.640]   And to me, I think that children have a natural
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.400]   and equal responsibility to care for their parents.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.840]   I am sometimes shocked and amazed
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.980]   at the lack of this in our society,
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.960]   but I guess I shouldn't be,
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.480]   because at their core, people are basically selfish.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.560]   And the idea then that people would continue
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.840]   to behave in a selfish way
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.200]   shouldn't be particularly surprising.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   But I can't see laws like that
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.440]   getting a wide degree of support in our time.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.640]   I think the biggest problem with laws like that
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.680]   is the same frustration that I have
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.200]   with the divorce court system
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.440]   of how do you determine
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.280]   what is an adequate level of support?
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.480]   And having provided counsel to, financial counsel,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.600]   to many people who have gone through divorce
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.160]   and experienced court settlements,
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.460]   I'm uniquely sensitive to the fact
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.160]   that when the divorce court judge prescribes
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.080]   a certain level of child support or alimony payments
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.180]   as required from a divorcing spouse,
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.720]   that often doesn't correlate
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.040]   to that person's moral responsibility.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.360]   And so let me give you just a practical example of this
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.560]   that I hope is thought-provoking.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.360]   As a father, I have a moral duty
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.880]   to provide for my wife and for my children.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.520]   That is my duty.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.800]   I have an obligation to do so.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.600]   I must do everything that I am capable of doing
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.840]   to provide for my family
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.480]   and so that they are able to experience
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.000]   safety, security, full bellies, et cetera.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.840]   But even as I say those words,
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.360]   what that actually means is something
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.800]   that we can widely debate.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   So for example, what does it mean to have a full belly?
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.240]   Well, I could fill up their bellies with rice and beans,
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.980]   or I could fill up their bellies with steak.
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.200]   One of them is vastly more healthy than the other,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.360]   and yet costs vastly higher dollar amounts.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.000]   So should I be required
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.640]   to feed my children steak three times a day,
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.380]   or is it adequate to have steak once a day
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.040]   or once every other day
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.360]   and have rice and beans once a day
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.240]   or once every other day, et cetera,
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.320]   in order to balance things out?
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.840]   When somebody wants the best for his children
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.680]   and wants to provide,
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.720]   he'll do everything that he's capable of.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.960]   But now imagine that a ham-handed judge comes in
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.600]   and says the level of duty that is required of you
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.940]   as a father is that your children have to have food
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.040]   and it has to fit these certain requirements.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.700]   Okay, that becomes very difficult
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.400]   because what is normal
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.160]   is that throughout the course of our lifetimes,
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.080]   we have certain periods where we can provide more
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.840]   and certain periods where we can provide less.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.080]   And so in a normal relationship with me and my wife
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.360]   and our budget and our children and our needs, et cetera,
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.100]   we can go back and forth and change our diet
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.400]   based upon our financial ability.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.800]   But when the court comes in and says you have to do this,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.920]   it becomes very heavy-handed, very ham-handed.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.920]   Similar things like providing shelter.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.360]   I have a moral obligation, a moral duty,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.640]   to provide shelter for my family.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.460]   But what is the definition of shelter?
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.240]   Does that mean that they need to live in a house
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.680]   or is an apartment acceptable?
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.400]   If we live in a house or in an apartment,
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.720]   is it adequate that I put four children in one room
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.960]   or do I need four bedrooms for four children?
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.400]   If I live in a house or an apartment,
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.240]   but then I go and I spend months in an RV,
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.320]   am I providing shelter?
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.720]   Or if I live in a tent in the woods
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.480]   because that's all our budget will afford,
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.800]   is that adequate?
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.240]   And so again, in a normal situation,
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.680]   we have the ability to adapt and to adjust
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.400]   and normal loving parents look and say
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.640]   what's best for my children, I wanna do that.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.680]   And there's a constant balancing that we do
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.200]   of the needs, the interests, and the obligations
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.440]   that we have for all members of the family.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.160]   Now, when you go to divorce court,
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.580]   the judge comes in, looks at your resources
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.960]   in terms of income, and then just simply,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.560]   basically prescribes a certain number
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.560]   and says this is the amount of money
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.960]   that you must pay for child support
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.780]   or this is the amount of money
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.200]   that you must pay for alimony.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.860]   And while, so set aside child support and alimony,
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.920]   child support I think is definitely a moral obligation
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.080]   that should be imposed by the force of law.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.760]   Alimony may or may not be a moral obligation
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.300]   depending on the circumstances of the divorce.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.360]   But let's focus with what's simple, child support.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.280]   Well, certainly, fathers and mothers
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.960]   should be required by society and by the courts
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.160]   to provide for their children.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.000]   But once again, is it a number?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.280]   And how do we know that number is enough, et cetera?
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.240]   So when the courts have to get involved
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.840]   in imposing a law, it becomes very,
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.600]   I don't know a better word to use than ham-handed.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.000]   It's like, okay, it's directionally right sometimes,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.080]   but lots of times it's not, and it doesn't allow
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.360]   for the normal kind of ups and downs of life.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.120]   So now I think about what would happen
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.800]   if there were a requirement to provide for parents
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.080]   and with filial responsibility laws,
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.600]   and how would that actually be implemented?
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.120]   Again, I don't know how it is implemented right now
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.540]   in the states that have these on the books,
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.280]   but it would become very complex.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.500]   What is the level of support
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.700]   that I must provide for my parents?
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.760]   I think that it's perfectly reasonable for me as a son
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.980]   to have a house with a room in it for my parents
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.360]   and provide for them a room that they can stay in
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.960]   and then welcome them into the family.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.000]   That, I think, is an ideal scenario for a family.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.440]   It's probably best if there's a little bit more separation,
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.840]   a separate wing of the house,
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.440]   or a little building on the backside of the garden is better,
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.000]   or a separate apartment within the house,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.280]   some kind of separation, I think, is the best ticket
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.080]   to quality family relationships.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.940]   But how big does the room have to be, et cetera?
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:52.240]   So I guess my commentary is just that it becomes,
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.600]   it's easy to see what should be done in broad terms
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   from the perspective of responsibility and moral duty.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.920]   It's not so easy to put that into legislation.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.120]   The other issue I would see
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.760]   with things like filial responsibility laws
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.720]   is that it would be very hard to see those laws enforced
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.000]   across state lines,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.240]   and especially in a country like the United States,
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.000]   because those are state laws,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   they're relatively easy to leave from,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.880]   relatively easy to cross state lines into another state
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.280]   that doesn't have those laws on the books.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.920]   And then in what way, what jurisdiction
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.520]   does a state-level government have
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.560]   to be able to pursue you to satisfy their claim upon you?
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.120]   So I'm in favor of the idea,
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.960]   but I don't have any predictions,
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.040]   nor do I really wanna be involved in any kind of movement
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.080]   of putting those things on the books.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.520]   We should shame people who do not support their parents.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.760]   We should, because we have,
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.920]   with building cultures of things that we praise and admire
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.640]   and things that we shame,
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.280]   those cultural-level influences
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.760]   are very effective and appropriate.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.760]   And so we should do what we can do personally and culturally,
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:13.320]   and we should not hold up as examples of anything positive,
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.400]   men and women who don't honor their parents,
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.800]   care for their parents,
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.520]   and we should shame very, as robustly as possible,
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.440]   those who do not fulfill their responsibility
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.640]   for their parents.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.320]   But in terms of turning that into law,
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.440]   I'll leave that to smarter people than me
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.480]   to think about how to handle those issues.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.520]   I just don't wanna be involved in that.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.240]   While I'm in favor of the responsibility,
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.920]   I don't wanna be involved in it from a legal perspective.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.360]   So now, thoughts about how to consider planning
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.960]   for siblings, relatives, or parents
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.520]   who may need additional help in old age.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.720]   Definitely.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.960]   At its core, this is a problem
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.880]   that is extremely simple to solve
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.640]   if you have a strong foundation of relationship.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.000]   In all interactions between human beings,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.920]   the nature of the relationship between human beings
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.080]   either makes things easy to do or hard to do.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.440]   And so if you have a good relationship among siblings,
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.120]   if you have a good relationship with parents or relatives
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.560]   or other family members
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.880]   who may need additional help in old age,
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.240]   it's relatively easy in the context
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.960]   of a strong and healthy relationship
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.680]   to find appropriate solutions.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.480]   Human beings can work together marvelously
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.880]   when they have strong, loving relationships
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.440]   filled with mutual respect, mutual love and affection,
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.520]   and good communication skills.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.520]   And so those are the fundamental things
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.480]   that we should always be building.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.400]   And we should be building those things
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.560]   from the earliest of ages with our children,
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.440]   with our parents, across in every direction,
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.200]   and then we should be seeking to enhance them
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.280]   as much as is possible.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.920]   And I think that this is something that we can all do.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.840]   We all have a role to play in this
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.460]   where we can improve relationships.
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:06.000]   No matter how difficult our relationships currently may be,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.720]   and in many cases, they are strained and they are difficult,
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.920]   we can all work together to improve them.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.320]   And if that is present,
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.800]   then all of the specific planning ideas
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.120]   of where are you gonna live
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.880]   or how are we gonna provide care, et cetera,
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.520]   are relatively simple.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.400]   If those good quality relationships are missing,
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:32.080]   or if the relationships are strained to begin with,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.840]   then we run the risk of all kinds of stuff
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.320]   being legal battles and there's distrust, et cetera.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.160]   So my hope is that we can build relationships.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.040]   What are some things that we can do in advance?
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.280]   Well, the first thing is,
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.000]   let's deal with our children,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.840]   'cause I'm right in the middle.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.720]   I've got children and I've got parents.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   So the first thing that I observed growing up as a child
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.400]   was to observe how my own parents
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.200]   fulfilled their filial duty to their family members,
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.880]   to their parents.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.160]   So the first thing that we can do is set an example
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.800]   with how we care for our own parents.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.200]   My father, when faced with his aging parents,
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.240]   said, "I will care for you
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.440]   "and I'll work with you in your old age,
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.360]   "but you're gonna have to come to me in Florida
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.560]   "rather than my coming to you out in Colorado,"
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.160]   where they were living at the time.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.020]   And so while my grandparents were significantly young,
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.640]   young enough to do it,
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.760]   then they moved from Colorado to Florida
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.960]   in order to be near my father.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.400]   And so that he could care for them in their old age.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.760]   And that was, I think, a great idea.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.920]   I think grandparents generally want to be
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.240]   where their children and grandchildren are.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.200]   That's often the thing
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   that disrupts people's retirement plans is they say,
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.280]   "Well, I wanna live in this particular place,"
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.720]   and then their children move around the country
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.160]   and they wind up following their children.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.080]   So you should discuss these things as much as possible
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.160]   and make your own plans in advance.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.840]   So my father moved his parents
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.440]   across the country to be near him.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.600]   Now, they weren't dependent on him.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.120]   They had a separate home.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.200]   They had their own income sources, but they were near him.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.000]   Then as they started to grow older,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.400]   my father built a house, a large house,
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.520]   that would be able to integrate his family together.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.920]   So he built a separate apartment within the house
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.160]   for his parents and he built,
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.720]   and it was large enough for his children as well.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.680]   So that he was able to get everybody under the same roof.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.640]   And so once again,
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.600]   this was a good, productive financial relationship,
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.920]   meaning that it wasn't that my grandparents were freeloading.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.400]   They paid a fair amount of money from their resources.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.920]   But of course, my father bore the primary risk
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.200]   and the primary decisions
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.240]   and the primary responsibility, et cetera.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.920]   And then as my grandparents aged and needed care,
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.440]   then my parents provided the care for them.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.520]   And as grandchildren, we were able to do that as well.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.000]   And I think it was a great scenario.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.480]   There are a few things I would do differently.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.920]   For example, I think my grandfather
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.920]   should never have retired.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.320]   That was a big mistake that we made.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.560]   And because when he retired,
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.520]   he got sick and old and got dementia.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.640]   Whereas if he'd never retired,
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.520]   I don't think he ever would have.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.720]   But you live and you learn.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.320]   So we had a good relationship.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.240]   So the point is in watching that as a child,
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.080]   it becomes part of the family culture
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.640]   that this is the proper way that you care for aging parents.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.920]   And so now, there's no doubt in my mind
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.040]   that every one of my siblings and I
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.240]   will and would, without a problem,
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.720]   provide exactly the same thing for my own parents
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   without any kind of frustration or anger
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.840]   or resentment, et cetera.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.200]   This is what we do for our parents.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.680]   And so that's something that you have to take in mind
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.320]   is that if you want your children
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.560]   to feel a sense of filial responsibility towards you,
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.880]   not only preach that and make it clear
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.960]   that that is an obligation that we have,
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.040]   it's a moral duty that we have,
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.240]   but just simply provide the example.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:10.480]   Another thing I think we can do is be thoughtful
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.720]   about how and when we interact with institutions.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.000]   One of the great concerns that I have
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.680]   about much of the modern parenting practice
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   is that we, in many cases, excessively use institutions
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.740]   to do work that is probably better done
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.080]   within the family or within the community.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.640]   And as such, our institutions become strong
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.520]   and mighty and powerful,
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.360]   while our communities become weaker and weaker,
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.020]   and our families become weaker and weaker.
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.520]   So I think that before we institutionalize
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.820]   our own children, we should stop and ask ourselves,
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.820]   am I creating a culture where institutionalizing people
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.900]   is the normal course?
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.140]   Because if that's the case, there's a good chance
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.900]   that my children are gonna turn around
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.900]   and institutionalize me when I am old and need help,
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.820]   rather than doing something within the context
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.080]   of the local community or the local family.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.240]   I do not enjoy going to retirement homes.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.380]   Over the years, I have had various relationships
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.840]   with people who have lived in these homes.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.320]   My mom has, for many years, run a weekly Bible study
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.000]   in a local retirement home.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.660]   And anytime I go into one of these homes,
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.460]   I look around and I see people
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.820]   whose physical needs are provided for.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.320]   They have a bed to sleep in,
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.220]   they have a nurse who's caring for them,
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.500]   they have food, medication, et cetera.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.880]   And yet, their emotional life is a barren wasteland.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.080]   And that saddens me immensely,
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.640]   because when you spend time in most of these institutions,
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.080]   you discover that the people within them
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.960]   are physically alive, but it's very difficult
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.280]   to see them thriving in life.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.360]   And it doesn't have to be that way.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.080]   - What is chronic migraine?
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.240]   It's 15 or more headache days a month,
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.160]   each lasting four hours or more.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.320]   Botox, onobotulinum toxin A,
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.800]   prevents headaches in adults with chronic migraine.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.560]   It's not approved for adults with migraine
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.080]   who have 14 or fewer headache days a month.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.040]   Ask your doctor about Botox.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.680]   - Botox is a prescription medicine injected by your doctor.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.360]   Effects of Botox may spread hours to weeks after injection,
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.640]   causing serious symptoms.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.800]   Alert your doctor right away,
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.920]   as difficulty swallowing, speaking, breathing,
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.320]   eye problems, or muscle weakness
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.120]   can be signs of a life-threatening condition.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.080]   Patients with these conditions before injection
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.000]   are at highest risk.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.960]   Side effects may include allergic reactions,
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.280]   neck and injection site pain, fatigue, and headache.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.960]   Allergic reactions can include rash,
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.880]   welts, asthma symptoms, and dizziness.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.960]   Don't receive Botox if there's a skin infection.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.440]   Tell your doctor your medical history,
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.640]   muscle or nerve conditions,
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.360]   including ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease,
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.520]   myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome,
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.000]   and medications, including botulinum toxins,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.840]   as these may increase the risk of serious side effects.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.920]   - Talk to your doctor and visit BotoxChronicMigraine.com

[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:18.080]   - I don't want to wax nostalgic
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.240]   for times gone by.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.080]   There's a massive danger of that
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.880]   because history is never one thing
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.920]   and basically you can pick what you want from history
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.880]   and make the point.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.600]   I think it's impactful though
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.800]   if we think about the concept of local communities,
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:41.160]   local families, as is in some cases,
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.320]   or has been in some cases, more common
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.600]   in localized agrarian societies.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.320]   The specific lesson I want to draw is this.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.800]   When communities were more local in nature,
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.000]   there was always useful and helpful work
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.560]   for old people to do.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.120]   No matter how old you were,
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.120]   you could still sit on the front porch
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:12.020]   and shell peas for supper.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.940]   No matter how feeble you were,
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.640]   you could still be present
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.680]   and watch the baby playing
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.120]   as long as there were appropriate safety
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.680]   and let others know if there was something that was needed.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.520]   And so there was always a place
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.180]   in those kinds of societies
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.220]   for multi-generational usefulness.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:34.440]   In our modern industrialized society,
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.680]   we have fractionalized,
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.360]   we've divided our lives
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.680]   and we've all become professional persons.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.440]   And thus, most of our identity
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.640]   comes not from who we are as a person
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.640]   or our involvement in the community,
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.040]   but rather, especially in American culture,
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.720]   it's drawn from our professional identity.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.040]   And so we go off in the day to our professional jobs
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.840]   and we do our professional work.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.320]   We send our children off to professional teachers
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.760]   to professionally instruct them
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.200]   and prepare them for their professional work.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.880]   And once our parents become professionally useless,
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.600]   we don't know what to do with them.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.920]   And basically, we expect them
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.080]   to sit around and watch TV all day.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.800]   And that is not something to look forward to.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.200]   It's why I'm so against the concept of retirement,
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.960]   meaning a withdrawal from useful work,
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.560]   not specifically meaning that somebody
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.760]   can make whatever choices he or she wants to make
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.680]   about earning income.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.960]   And so we should be very careful
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.080]   before we establish the precedent
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.920]   that our parents are going to become useless
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.280]   and we should look for ways to integrate them
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.480]   because they're not useless.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.520]   They have a lot to do.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.200]   And it's really important
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.040]   that our elders continue to have a useful
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.080]   and important role in the community.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.720]   But in order to accomplish that,
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.000]   we need to be proactive about identifying the great things
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.320]   about our technologically advanced societies.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.560]   I would not want to go back myself,
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.840]   but also recognize what we've lost and bring it back in
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.720]   because we are living in a world and in a time
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.280]   where there's so much that we can do
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.000]   if we just simply do it.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.200]   So let's nurture relationships
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.720]   and let's build relationships.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.320]   And then let's nurture communication
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.200]   in those relationships.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.280]   So how can relationships be improved?
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.440]   I think just loving people is the key.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.720]   And I don't mean that in kind of a loosey-goosey way.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.200]   I mean, in putting it into practice.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.560]   There are psychopaths in society.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.960]   And if you have a psychopath for a relative,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.280]   clearly you should be careful.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.920]   And there are good reasons to cut off relationships entirely.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.160]   But in general, the basic thing
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.320]   that harms any human relationship
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.480]   is selfishness and unwillingness to love.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.200]   When you love another person,
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.120]   that means that you lay down your life for that person.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.960]   You do what that person desires.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.560]   You seek the best for that person.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:08.080]   You believe the best about that person.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.480]   You ascribe to that person the best motivations
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.400]   that you can possibly come up with.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.840]   You give to that person.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.680]   You think about what that person likes.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.880]   And you treat that person the way
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.400]   that you would like to be treated if you were that person.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.840]   And when we do that and we suppress our selfishness
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.080]   and our egocentric lifestyle
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.840]   and we focus more on what's in it for other people,
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.400]   relationships improve.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.360]   They may not be great.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.160]   Other people may never acknowledge it,
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.360]   but they can improve.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.960]   And so the most practical thing
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.080]   is to improve relationships.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.160]   In the context of relationships,
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:46.160]   if we are men and women of virtue and moral uprightness,
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.960]   then we can move to communication.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.600]   And so one of the things that we should do
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.760]   and must do is communicate.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.680]   Communicate about our dreams
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.480]   and communicate about our family members' dreams.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.160]   Understand what our family members want
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.600]   and understand what we ourselves want
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.600]   and interact with them in such a way
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.080]   that we can learn what we need to learn
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.320]   about their situation so that we can plan together.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.520]   So much of the time,
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.320]   if we just talked about our interests
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.480]   and talked about our shared visions,
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.800]   we could work together.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.520]   Especially in the American culture context,
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.000]   we have a great strength and a great weakness
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.920]   in our cultural identity.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.360]   The great strength is the power of the individual.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.160]   Being a very individualistic society,
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.040]   we believe that individuals can succeed.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.240]   And we believe that individuals should succeed
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.560]   based upon their own behaviors and their own merits.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.280]   And that is powerful because the basic level of success,
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.520]   the basic level of get up and go,
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.960]   the level of independence and autonomy
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.400]   that is culturally present among US Americans broadly
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.840]   is higher than any other place
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.240]   that I have been or seen or studied.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.680]   But the flip side is we get so accustomed
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.200]   to our high individualism
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.120]   that we forget about working together.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.320]   We forget about the power of having shared visions,
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.640]   shared goals, and working together
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.480]   in a symbiotic relationship.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.840]   And I don't see why it has to be that way.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.840]   Maybe it does, but I don't see why it has to be that way.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.400]   As I see it, what we want to do
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:38.160]   is we want to encourage intense, powerful,
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:42.800]   motivated individualism, and then collaborate together
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:48.240]   in a symbiotic, synergistic relationship.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.000]   And we want to help one another and encourage one another.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.080]   And so if we communicated about things
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.960]   and we started to work towards a shared vision
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:00.480]   among families, then I think we can accomplish
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.560]   far greater goals.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.400]   What I don't think works is the infection that we have
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.680]   in much of modern society
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.760]   that basically the purpose of life
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.080]   is personal pleasure and happiness.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.800]   Obviously, we all enjoy pleasure and happiness,
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.640]   but if we can't build some kind of shared vision
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.760]   that goes beyond personal pleasure and personal happiness,
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.040]   I don't see how family members
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.760]   can work very effectively together.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.720]   And this, to me, seems a cancer
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.360]   that is undergirding much of our modern lifestyle.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.600]   We look at the world through a lens of
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.920]   how is my happiness improved?
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.720]   How am I gonna be happier?
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.960]   And happiness is elusive
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.400]   and not particularly achievable as a goal.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.000]   It's a byproduct, not a goal.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.120]   And when pursued directly, it very rarely comes to fruition.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:58.080]   When individuals pursue individual happiness,
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.040]   then they pass everything through this lens of saying,
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.680]   am I happier without you or am I happier with you?
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.760]   This is a cancer that is eating away
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.880]   at many modern marriage relationships.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.520]   Instead of husbands and wives coming together
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.500]   to build something that neither one of them
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.480]   can build individually, that is a family,
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.800]   they come together often, unfortunately,
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.680]   under the erroneous idea that somehow being together
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.600]   will cause them to be happy.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.740]   And then when they find themselves less happy together,
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.600]   then they say, well, maybe I'll be happier
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.000]   if I'm not with this guy.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.600]   Maybe you will, maybe you won't.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   But generally speaking, if you weren't happy with someone,
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.880]   you're probably not generally gonna be happy without them.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.040]   Let me be careful because I don't wanna say
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.680]   that there are not relationships
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.160]   that genuinely are damaging, there often are.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.160]   What I mean is that knowing what makes you happy
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.040]   is vanishingly difficult.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.880]   And then being able to put a plan in place
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.760]   to make yourself happy is very, very difficult.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.200]   We're living in a society that self-reportedly
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.240]   describes itself as incredibly depressed.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.080]   People are popping pills all day left, right, and center,
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.800]   and yet we live in a society in which it's never been easier
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.600]   to pursue your own happiness.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.760]   It's a fool's errand.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.320]   If we set aside the pursuit of our own happiness
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.620]   and we focus instead on a higher vision,
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:31.000]   a love for a neighbor, a building of dynasty,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.840]   a building of community,
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.240]   a transformation of the world around,
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.880]   serving the unfortunate, loving the unloved, et cetera,
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.560]   we find ourselves happy in the midst of circumstances
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.960]   that previously would have thought ourselves miserable in
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.720]   because we find a deeper level of joy and meaning.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.720]   And so families can often do this much more effectively
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.400]   if there's a shared vision.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.040]   And what we often seem to lack in our modern society
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.880]   is any kind of shared vision.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.520]   This week on Twitter, somebody made a comment
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.520]   something like about, you know, what's the point of,
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.160]   let me find the comment, standby.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:12.800]   Comment is this, from dollarsanddata,
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.440]   great account by the way.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.960]   Building generational wealth is extremely overrated.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.600]   If overcoming hardship is what made you successful,
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.380]   why would you make life so easy for your offspring?
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.700]   My answer is this,
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:32.480]   because the money is only a necessary first step
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.760]   to spreading ideas and culture to better the world.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.840]   Americans myopically believe money is a goal
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.800]   rather than a means to the goal.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.760]   And so I see this very broadly in American society.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.480]   People think that money is the goal.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.280]   And so anything that enhances the money,
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.640]   well, of course, you know, that's great,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.040]   but money is just a necessary step
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.200]   to accomplishing those bigger, more important goals
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.960]   that go far beyond money.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.360]   And so when you think about this in the context of family,
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.200]   if you have a shared vision,
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.180]   something where you're working together
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.180]   over the course of generations,
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.540]   it can draw your family together.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.560]   Now, this doesn't necessarily have to be
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.840]   something that sounds great to other people.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.280]   Maybe it's your family's potential
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.280]   that you may forever end homelessness on the earth
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.160]   or whatever, you know, blood pressure problems
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.480]   or cancer or something like that.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.680]   That's wonderful.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.040]   But for many people, it's just simply a vision
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.960]   of that's much simpler.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.400]   Here's our family business and we're having children
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.880]   and enjoying relationship together
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.280]   and building community together, et cetera.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.120]   But those things matter.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.820]   If we build a shared common culture
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.320]   and we work together in it,
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.200]   then siblings and relatives, family, parents, et cetera,
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.520]   we can all go farther ahead together.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.060]   And that's what family should be.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.160]   But in order to get there,
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.400]   we have to communicate about those things.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.420]   And we have to seek to build a shared vision
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.760]   to the degree that it is possible.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.440]   We want to build a shared vision.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:12.360]   I believe that it's possible to a significant degree.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.800]   Maybe not the highest ultimate degree.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.600]   There's too much individuality among all of us,
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.800]   but I believe that it's largely possible.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.680]   Check back in 30 years and I'll tell you how I'm going.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:29.040]   In the context of strong quality relationships
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.880]   and good communication,
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.160]   we can solve most of the other problems.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.320]   So then the next element of communication,
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.440]   in addition to those big grandiose ideas
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.480]   of common vision and et cetera,
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.400]   is just simply create,
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.560]   have open, honest conversations about things that matter.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.640]   In some family relationships and in some families,
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.840]   I am amazed at how little of substance is said
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.840]   over the abundant family get-togethers.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.760]   You can go to family get-together
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.320]   after family get-together after family get-together,
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.480]   and you can find so little of actual substance shared
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.280]   because everyone is so intent on not offending one another
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.640]   or not betraying who a person really is
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:20.600]   that we just pass through the sphere
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.720]   of each other's presence
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.800]   and never interact with someone on a deeper level.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.000]   But it only takes one person to start that change,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.080]   to start communicating about things that matter.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.520]   And so what things would matter?
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.840]   Well, one would be asking questions like,
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.440]   dad, mom, what's your vision for your older years?
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.160]   And then listening or talking about money.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.560]   A huge thing that we can do,
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.840]   especially those of us who are parents,
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:50.800]   is voluntarily open up to our children
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.360]   about our wishes and about our money
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.280]   and communicate about them.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.760]   One of the standard pieces of advice that I always implement
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.680]   when talking with retiree age people
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.560]   is to say, are you consistently communicating
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.240]   with your children about your finances in detail?
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.480]   Because generally your children are going to feel
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.160]   a sense of reserve and caution
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.120]   and a lack of wanting to meddle in your affairs.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.120]   And so they're often not going to bring up the subjects.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.040]   But you as the parent can improve the communication
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.400]   by consciously saying, children,
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.000]   I want to bring you into my life
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.960]   and tell you where I am and how I'm doing
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.600]   and talk with you about this stuff.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.040]   And you can create a culture of communication with them.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.240]   And this is something that's helpful.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.560]   They need to know the details
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.720]   so that you can work together on those details.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.040]   You can start at either end.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:50.200]   I've always appreciated that when changing your life
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.800]   and lifestyle, you can start at either end.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.960]   You can start with a big grandiose vision of goals
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.000]   and vision and things you want to achieve.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.920]   Or you can also just start with cleaning up your to-do list.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.640]   Either way works.
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.680]   If you clean up your to-do list effectively,
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.800]   then in time you can get onto the dreams
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.160]   and the goals and the vision.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.600]   You start with the dreams and the goals and the vision,
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.560]   sometimes you can sit down and fix the to-do list
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.520]   eventually when your vision is strong enough.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.800]   And so either form of communication works.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.160]   You can start with the dollars and cents
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.440]   and that leads into the big picture vision.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.800]   Or you can start with the big picture vision
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.720]   and it'll bleed back to the dollars and cents.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.360]   But you need to open up with communication
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.760]   and start talking about those things that matter.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.200]   Then you can bring in questions such as,
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.560]   what would it look like if we worked together
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.560]   on these things?
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:41.520]   How could we improve our family dynamic
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.920]   if we worked together?
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.680]   Financially speaking, I think it's obvious
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.400]   that parents and children should work together.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.440]   So for example, I think it's stupid
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:55.200]   how we handle family relationships in the United States
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.080]   where we often kick our children out at the age of 18
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:02.280]   to force them to go and struggle for years on their own
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.760]   instead of working together and supporting them
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.840]   in some productive way.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.640]   As with anything, there is a flip side.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.240]   We don't wanna enable a basement dweller
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.720]   who's irresponsible, et cetera.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:19.040]   But if we can create positive character
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.760]   and we see people working hard,
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.880]   then we can support our children so much.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.360]   And I think there's a massive disconnect
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   between what the wealthy often do and those who don't.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.440]   In my work of consulting with people,
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.120]   many times of significant wealth,
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.080]   I've noticed that so many times,
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.280]   wealthy people are grateful for the ways
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.480]   that their parents helped them get ahead,
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.680]   for the fact that they went to an elite school
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.680]   and they graduated debt-free,
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.040]   for the fact that their parents helped them
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.520]   get their first house or various things like that.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.480]   It's so impactful when your parents help you get ahead
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.120]   if you are responsible.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.960]   So we need to be very careful not to turn out deadbeats
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.560]   or enable deadbeats.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.720]   But if we're working with people who aren't deadbeats,
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.440]   then we should work together and support one another.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.360]   And so let me give you just a simple example
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.560]   that I've thought of a lot over the years.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.040]   If you wanna have grandchildren,
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.080]   one of the ways that you can do that
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.720]   and make it more possible for your children
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.800]   to have children is help them with housing.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:35.240]   So why is it that so often there's a empty-nester couple
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.080]   rattling around in an enormous house
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.960]   while their children are scraping by
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.960]   in a tiny apartment somewhere,
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.640]   trying to figure out how they're gonna shoehorn
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.560]   another baby into the extra closet?
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.280]   Now there are, of course, some good reasons
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.600]   why that happens.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.840]   But in general, this is, to me, a kind of obvious example
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.160]   of what would be the power of working together.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.160]   Why is it that the parents shouldn't or wouldn't or won't
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.640]   move into the apartment themselves and say,
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.800]   "Here, children, you guys need the big house now.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.400]   "We'll pass it along."
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.840]   Well, usually it's due to those more fundamental factors
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.040]   that I've talked long about.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.920]   How do we integrate people together?
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.200]   Do we have shared vision, et cetera?
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.440]   Is that a desire that we have?
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.840]   Do we wanna see our families grow?
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.880]   Do we wanna enable this behavior that's appropriate?
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.480]   Or are we focused on living in a fancy-looking house?
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:31.280]   I leave it for you as a brain worm.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.560]   If you wanna have grandchildren,
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.840]   then raise children who get married
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.880]   and wanna have children,
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.720]   and then parents move into the apartment
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.640]   and give the children the big house,
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.120]   and do that down through the generations,
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.400]   and you'll create a family that is powerful
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.160]   and large and growing,
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.920]   rather than one in which everyone is in his or her own silo
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.040]   trying to do it all ourselves
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.160]   and having a very inefficient time of it.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.760]   There's much more that could be said,
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.960]   but I think these are the most important things to be said.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.400]   The specifics of where are we gonna live,
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.680]   how are we gonna work out the bills,
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.800]   who's gonna take care of parents,
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.680]   family schedules, nurses, no nurses,
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.440]   housing, rooms, et cetera,
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.400]   those are up to each individual situation
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.240]   to find something that's appropriate.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.480]   I am glad to know that, at least a few years ago,
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.680]   I read an article that said a big trend
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.520]   in new housing development is to develop housing
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.600]   that incorporates living space
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.880]   for multiple members of the family in it.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.560]   I think that's great.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.720]   And I really appreciate how I think that this is,
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.520]   I really admire cultures where this is culturally expected.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.560]   I think a lot of times the cultural expectations,
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.920]   especially on Asians and Latin people, et cetera,
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:54.160]   is often high and that comes with its own problems.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.160]   But I admire so much that it's so common
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.280]   in Asian households to have multi-generational families.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.440]   And to me, as long as we can deal with the boundary stuff
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.840]   appropriately and healthily,
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.560]   that just seems such a wonderful trend to me.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.680]   And I'm glad the housing and whatnot is reflecting on that.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.440]   To me, though, at its core,
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.520]   if we just focus on improving relationships
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.120]   and enhancing communication in those relationships,
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.880]   and then building as much shared vision
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.800]   and common purpose as is possible,
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.960]   and to emphasize,
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.960]   we're not all gonna go out and change the world together
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.200]   and be solving poverty in Africa together.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.440]   That's not a realistic goal.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.360]   But building a shared vision
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.880]   of what we want the next decade to look like
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.680]   and working together to the degree that is possible,
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:50.520]   given our individual unique perspectives on the world,
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.200]   that will enhance it.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.600]   And if you want to do something
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.720]   to help the planning opportunities for siblings,
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.680]   relatives, or parents who may need additional help
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:05.680]   in old age, focus on relationship and communication.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.960]   Because in the context of good relationships
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.800]   and strong communication,
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.000]   details will be easy.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.120]   Without good relationships, the best possible,
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.720]   and strong communication skills,
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:25.040]   then all those specific decisions will be very difficult.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.440]   So to me, that's the most important thing
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.120]   for us to focus on.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.160]   Thank you for the question.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.520]   It's thought-provoking.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.880]   May we be those who set an example
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.600]   based upon the way that we live,
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.080]   live with vision so that those who come behind us
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:40.960]   can go farther than we and put into practice
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.280]   the things that we know to do.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.560]   So it's not all just a fantasy,
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.680]   but it comes into reality.
