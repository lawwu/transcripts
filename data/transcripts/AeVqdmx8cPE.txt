[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   are to be found in the chapter that we read at the beginning,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   namely the fourteenth chapter in Paul's epistle to the Romans,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   in the seventeenth verse.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   The seventeenth verse in the fourteenth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost."
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, or eating and drinking,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost."
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Now here we are looking at a verse that is very characteristic
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   and very typical of this great apostle.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   It reminds us at once of some of the things which were so characteristic of him
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   and which are to be seen constantly in all his letters
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   and which stamp them at once as having been written by him and by him only.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   For one thing, we are struck immediately by his peculiar characteristic
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   in the matter of his actual style of writing, his mode or method of composition.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Suddenly, without any warning and into the midst of an argument
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   that seems somewhat to prosaic, he suddenly bursts forth with this tremendous assertion.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Now that, as we have often had occasion to see, is very characteristic of this man.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   You get these sudden flashes which suddenly illumine a matter
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   that seemed almost dull and uninteresting with all the glories and the wonders
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   of the Christian gospel and the Christian faith.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And here is, as I say, a very typical illustration of that very thing.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   He is working his way through this wearisome argument that had arisen
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   because of certain conditions obtaining in the Church of Rome,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   and he deals with it in his customary patient manner.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Then suddenly he bursts forth upon us and says,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   and joy in the Holy Ghost."
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And at once we are gazing at the central verities of the Christian faith.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And then another thing that strikes us at once about the statement is this.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   It gives us a glimpse immediately into the bigness of this man,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   his essential greatness, the magisterial character of his mind and of his thinking.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   That is ever again a characteristic of the apostle.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   He sees and delights in looking at the great principles.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Not that he is not interested in the details.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   He is, and we have often watched him as he works through them.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   But the great characteristic, I say, of the man's mind is
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   the way in which he ever keeps true to these central verities,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   the big things, the majestic things.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Now this is again, I say, something which it is always well to observe with respect to him.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   He not only delights in the big things and in the great fundamental principles,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   but he has an abhorrence of pettiness and of smallness.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   He was made on such a scale that only the glorious things and the big things rarely appealed to him.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And it was ever to him a matter of distress that people could ever be immersed in anything apart from these things.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And so you find, like this in this chapter,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   suddenly you get one of these great gusts of wind, this breath of fresh air,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   clearing the atmosphere, and suddenly making us aware that the mist is gone
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   and we are looking at some majestic, glorious peaks,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   the mountains of God standing before us as we find them in this Christian message.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And as he does this, you always feel that he makes everything else look rather ridiculous and rather small.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I would couple with this element of bigness and of greatness in the apostle
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   a kind of impatience which he does just let us see
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   with everything that falls short of this conception and this view of the essential nature of the Gospel.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   It isn't that he's finally impatient, and yet there is a kind of impatience that surely is right and is spiritual.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Now let me give you some other illustrations of the point I'm making.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I feel that it's here in this very word "for" with which he introduces this statement.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Here he is working out this argument and then, as it were, he feels he must ridicule the whole thing.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   He says, "For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking."
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   How could you ever have thought that it was, when actually it is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Listen to him doing the same thing in the epistle to the Galatians,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   where again he's been involved in that great discussion as to the place and the importance of circumcision
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   in the life of the Christian believer, and he's dealt with it so patiently.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   He's argued it out, he's worked it out, and he's given his illustrations,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   and then he says in the last chapter, verse 17, as if he'd only just been managing to contain himself right through,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   he says, "From henceforth let no man trouble me."
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   No more of this nonsense.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Why spend our time with things like that, when we should be spending them and might be spending them with these other things?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   "From henceforth," he says, "let no man trouble me."
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   "God forbid," he says, "that I should glory save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world."
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Well, here I say we've got another example of all that, the bigness of the man coming through,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   the largeness of his mind and of his outlook, his whole conception of the Christian faith.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   He towers out as one of the gigantic intellects of all the ages, a big man in every sense,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   and whose view of the gospel corresponds.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Or, to put it better, here is a man, you see, who has been made big by the great, the big, the mighty gospel,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   of which he was a preacher.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And then the other thing which I noticed thus in passing is that, and it's here on the very surface,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   the sanity of this man, his sanity, or if you prefer it, the balance of his mind.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And a great mind is always a balanced mind.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   He sees round the subject, he sees it in due perspective, he sees things in their right proportion.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And what he does here, of course, is just to bring these Roman Christians back to the balance.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   They had lost it. He brings them back to it.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   For he himself, I say, was characterized in a sense above everything else by this very balance,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   this sanity, this wholeness, this completeness, this roundness.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   That's the characteristic, as it is ever the characteristic of a truly big and a truly great mind.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Well now then, it is, I say, something that stands out on the surface.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   We see these things at once, and especially in the somewhat dramatic way in which the verse suddenly bursts upon us.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And it arrests us and we say, "What is this?"
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Well, there, I say, is the answer.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It's this man and his view and his understanding of the Christian message and the Christian faith.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Well now, the thing for us to do is to discover how it was he came to do this,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   and how it was he came to utter this majestic statement.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And it was, as you see from the chapter and the context,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   because of the conditions that were prevailing at that time in the church at Rome.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   He starts off at once by saying, "He that is weak in the faith, receive ye."
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Don't despise the man because he is weak in the faith.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Be always ready to receive him, but he says, "Not to doubtful disputations."
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Or, if you like, "Not to resolution of doubts."
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Or, "Not just to be arguing with him about certain matters that are doubtful."
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Now there's the key at once.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And there were a number of subjects like that, about which there were many in trouble and in distress in the church at Rome,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   about this question of observation of particular days,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   eating particular meats, drinking particular drinks.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And there were people in the church at Rome who spent the whole of their time in talking about these things and arguing about them.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Whenever you met them, up it came at once.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   They tried to convince you about them, and not only that, unfortunately,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   they were judging one another and indeed going further.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   They were even condemning one another.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   They were saying that if a man didn't hold their view on this particular thing, he wasn't really a Christian at all.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And they were dismissing him and condemning him,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   excommunicating him, as it were, in their minds and pronouncing a final kind of damnation upon them.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And the result was that there were many people who were very perplexed and very upset.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And of course the weaker Christians, the weaker brethren, were particularly in a state of turmoil.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Here they were, hearing these arguments and disputations.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   One man saying, "If you don't observe this particular day, you're not truly a Christian."
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   But the other said, "It's another day." And he was equally emphatic.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And all these questions of eating and drinking, and they were utterly confused,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   wondering whether they had ever been Christians at all, and wondering what they had to do, changing their positions.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And thus, their time was being spent by constant talk and wrangling about all these matters.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Now that's the context.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   And it was in the midst of that kind of position that the apostle hurls this tremendous asseveration.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Well, now you see, in doing that, he deals with a very important principle for us all to remember always.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   For here he is dealing with one of the very subtlest of all the methods that the devil ever implies
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   to ruin an individual Christian life, or the life of the Christian Church in general.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   It is, I say, one of his most subtle weapons, which he has been implying throughout the centuries, and which he still implies.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   What am I referring to? Well, it is this very thing to which I've already adverted in passing.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   It's a lack of balance. It's a lack of a sense of proportion.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Here you see he's dealing with people who have already become Christians.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   His first endeavour is to prevent us from becoming Christians at all.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   But once we've become Christians, he ceases to do that. He knows that's no longer of any value.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   He now comes in and tries to create confusion, sidetracks us if he can.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And he does it, I say, in this way, by putting such emphasis upon the wrong things in our thinking that we've lost our balance,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   we've lost our sense of proportion.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   It's over-concentration on secondary and third-rate matters.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   That was what was happening here.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   They were interested in deductions rather than in the primary principles.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   If you like it, we can put it like this.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   The subject the apostle deals with is the danger of missing the wood because of the trees.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   That you spend so much of your time in looking at one particular tree
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   that you become unaware of the fact that there's a great wood and that this is but one tree in the wood,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   missing the wood because of the trees.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   This over-concentration on matters which are not primary but are secondary and third-rate,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   he says, for the kingdom of God is not this and that and that but this.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   They've departed from the primary principles
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   and are immersed and involved and in constant wranglings about the things that are secondary
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   and even further down the scale than that.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   They forget the foundation principles
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   and they have been tending to do so to such an extent that in practice they're actually denying them.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Now the subtlety of the question comes in in this way.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   They were not aware of this.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   If you had gone to any one of these people and said, "Now how is a man justified?"
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   They would undoubtedly have said, "A man is justified by faith alone."
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   And yet you see in practice they had got into a position in which they were really saying
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   that a man is justified by the observance of particular days
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   or by being circumcised or not being circumcised
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   or eating or not eating, drinking or not drinking certain things.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   They were not aware of it. It's so subtle.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   It's something which happens to you without your being aware of it.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   You gradually drift away. You've become so involved about these details
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   you've forgotten your first principles.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And you don't see that you're in a position in which you really are denying
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   the very first principles from which you set out.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Now that is the kind of thing with which the apostle had to deal
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   on this occasion in writing to these people at Rome.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And you notice the way in which he deals with it.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   It is always his method.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   It has always been the method in every time of reformation.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   There is only one thing to do with such a situation.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   And that is to come back to and to assert the primary principles,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   the fundamental postulates, the whole foundation of the Christian position.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Now that doesn't mean, as I say, that you shouldn't really deal with the individual matters as such.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   That's all right. But there is a danger if you stop at that.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   And the apostle never does stop at that.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   He can meet them on their own ground, but that isn't the final answer.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   The final answer is to say, "Now here is the position.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Can you relate these other positions to that?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   If you can't, they're wrong."
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   So he lays down for us in this majestic statement
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   certain first principles which must ever be the touchstone of any teaching.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Here, I say, is the final test of any view or teaching we may happen to know
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   or any position which we may happen to occupy.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   And therefore I hold them before you this morning
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   not because I am primarily concerned about or interested in any particular detailed matters,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   but because I feel it is a good thing that we should at Inneret this morning
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   look again together at the central principles of our Christian faith.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   We can never do this too frequently.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Every New Testament epistle does it.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   They generally start with this sort of thing.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   But even when they come to the practical matters,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   they always keep close to the fundamental principles.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   We must do so,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   because we must never be in a position in which we've forgotten the origins.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   The moment we lose that connection, we've already gone astray.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Very well, then, here is something by which we can test ourselves
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   and see whether we are or are not still truly holding
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   to the cardinal elements of the Christian position.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   The apostle puts it first and foremost as a negative.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   He says, "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink."
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   There are certain things which we must not identify the kingdom of God with.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   He takes up these particular matters of eating and drinking,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   observation of days, and so on.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   All right, they still obtain as they did in the days of the apostle himself,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   but this is only a matter of principle.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   There are many, many other things which we could put into the list.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   And as you read the history of the Church, you see how often good people,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   honest and sincere and zealous people,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   have gradually gone into one of these positions
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   and have been denying the central elements.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   What are some of these other things?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Well, here are some of them.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   This question of days is still with us.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   There are denominations that define themselves in terms of days.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   We are familiar with that.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   But it isn't only that.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   There are certain people who do really seem to identify the kingdom of God
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   with a question like that of pacifism.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Now, the way you test them is this.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   What is the man always talking about?
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   That's the way to test a man.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   The moment you start speaking to him, out comes this particular thing.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Well, now, there are many such, I say, to whom pacifism seems to be the beginning and the end,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   the one test of whether a man is a Christian or not.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   To others it's a question of temperance.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Always talking about it, always emphasising it,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   can't leave it alone, always brought into the centre.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Temperance.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Modes of baptism.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Here it is, this is the one thing that matters.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Not only that, particular denominations.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   These are the big things.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   These are the first things they talk to you about.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   These are the things they emphasise.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   It's exactly the principle that the apostle is dealing with.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Episcopacy.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Is it essential or isn't it essential?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Is it of the very essay of the Church, or merely the bene essay of the Church?
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Oh, I could go on giving you a very long list.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Forms of worship, and things like that.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Now, these are the modern counterparts of these old problems
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   with which the apostle had to deal in this Church of Rome
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   and in the other early Christian churches.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Well, now, what is the apostle teaching with regard to all this?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Let's be clear about it.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   He does not say that these things are entirely unimportant.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   It would be very wrong to draw that conclusion.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   He doesn't say that they are of no interest at all.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Yes, they are important, they are of interest.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   And we mustn't dismiss them altogether.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   But there are certain things that we must be clear about with respect to them.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And here are some of them.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   We must never make these things central and primary.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   That was the trouble in Rome.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   These things had been exalted from their subsidiary positions right into the very centre.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   They had become the beginning and the end, everything.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   They must never be put into the position of centrality or primary importance.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   That means, I say, that we must never be always talking about them,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   and talking more about them than anything else.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   It must never be the first thing with which we confront people.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   We mustn't be known as the sort of people who are always associated with these secondary and third-rate matters.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   That's the thing that the Apostle puts down as his great principle.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   We must never make these things the acid test of a man's profession of the Christian faith.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   They were doing that, they were judging one another, and he tells them that they mustn't do that.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   He says, "Who art thou that judgest another man's servant?"
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   "Who are you," he says, "that are condemning another man?"
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   They were making these things the very acid test of a man's profession of Christianity.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   He says, "You must never do that."
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Still less.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   "Must you ever judge and condemn in a final sense those who don't agree with you about these particular questions?"
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   There are his negative rulings.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Well, let's look at the way in which he puts it positively. He puts it like this.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   "We must recognize, therefore, that these matters, though they have their importance,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   are not central and are not absolutely vital.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Every man," says the Apostle, "must be true to his own conscience with respect to them."
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   He says, "A man stands or falls to his own master.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   "Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth."
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   You've got to face these questions, and he says you've got to come to a serious and a sullen decision with respect to them.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   You are true to your own conscience, you must hold your view honestly, and you really must hold to your view.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   He says, "He that doubteth his damn defeat because he eateth not of faith,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   for whatsoever is not of faith is sin." Very well.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   "We must face these problems, we must face them in the light of the teaching of the Scriptures,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   and we must come to a conclusion. And let us be honest, let us be conscientious."
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Right. But then he goes on to say this.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   "You must recognize," he says, "that everybody else has exactly the same liberty as you have yourself.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   One man esteemeth this day, another man esteemeth the other."
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Very well, says the Apostle, let him do so.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord, and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it."
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   That doesn't mean to say that you never discuss these matters and you don't give the Scriptural principles. You do.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   But I say that you, having done so, you don't condemn them.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   "Every man does this to the Lord.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord, and he that regardeth not the day,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   to the Lord he doth not regard it."
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   And so on with eating and with drinking.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   In these secondary matters, or matters of indifference, as they're called,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   there must be liberty.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   There must be complete liberty.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   You don't divide on these questions.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   You don't condemn, you don't excommunicate on these questions.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   You don't say, "Now this thing is so important that this is rarely determinative."
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   You must never do that, says Paul.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Allow to the other men the same liberty as you're enjoying yourself.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And then, on top of that, he says that we must always exercise great charity also.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   We must have sympathy with the other men.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Above all, we must never be a stumbling block to him.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   He says, "Destroy not with thy meat that brother for whom Christ died."
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   "Are you going to make this thing so important that that man is going to be destroyed as it were by it?"
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   "Don't do that," says the apostle.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   "The thing's not big enough for that. Where's your sense of proportion?"
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink."
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   "Remember what the kingdom of God is," he says,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   "and if you do, you'll have great love in your heart and charity towards your brother,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   and especially these weaker brethren."
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   You won't be so concerned just to prove that you were right,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   but you'll be concerned that you don't make that man stumble.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   You'll be concerned about his soul and about his relationship to the Lord.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Now, that's his teaching.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   These matters are not primary.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   They're secondary, third rate.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   They're deductions. They're incidentals.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   And we must never put them there in the centre.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Otherwise, we are violating the principles of liberty and of charity at one and the same time.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   The kingdom of God, and let us remember it is not eating and drinking.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   The kingdom of God does not consist in certain deductions from the Christian faith.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   This is not the foundation. This is not the thing.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Well, what is it?
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Well, here he tells us.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   "And this is the thing I trust that we shall hold in our minds."
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   The kingdom of God is not meat and drink.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Well, what is it?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   It's righteousness.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   It's peace.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   It's joy in the Holy Ghost.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   What are we to talk about?
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   What are the things that we are to emphasize?
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   What are the things that we are to keep in the centre?
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   What are the things that we always bring with us whenever we appear amongst people?
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   What are the things we stand for?
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   "Here they are," says the apostle.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   "Henceforth, let no man trouble me.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   I've dealt with these things, but please don't keep me there.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Leave me alone.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   I want to be looking at the cross. I want to be coming to the centre.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Let no man trouble me any more.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   God forbid that I should glory.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink."
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Now that's the position.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Well, what is this?
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Well, we can put it like this.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   There are certain things that are essential.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   There are certain things that are central.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   There are certain things about which there is to be no latitude and no liberty.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Liberty and latitude and charity with regard to those other things, not about these things.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   This is the kingdom of God.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   And because it's a foundation, you mustn't touch it.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   When you're in the realm of deductions, well, don't be too dogmatic.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Don't condemn.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   But here, you must be absolutely dogmatic.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   This is the kingdom of God.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   There's no discussion here, discussion there, certainly.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Liberty, charity, but not at this point.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   For the kingdom of God is, and this is something foundational and fundamental and absolutely central.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   We mustn't be doubtful about these things.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   And if a man comes to us and is doubtful and uncertain about these things, we must put him right.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   These are not doubtful disputations.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   These are not resolutions of doubts.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   These are the foundation of the faith.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   And if a man isn't right here, he's not a Christian at all.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   We must say that. We must assert that.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   This is the kingdom of God.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Well, what is it?
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Well, you notice, he really puts it still in contrast to these other things about which they were talking so much in Rome.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   "If you want to talk," says Paul, "here's something to talk about. Righteousness."
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Oh, not about this day or that day or this meat or that drink.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   No, no, if you want to talk about something, well, talk about righteousness.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And when you meet people, talk about righteousness.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   What is it?
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   Well, it seems to me that there can be no doubt as to what it means here.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   It's the great word of this epistle.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   And I cannot agree with those who say that it hasn't a meaning here, that it has right away in this epistle from the very beginning.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   He mentions it, first of all, this righteousness of God in the first chapter.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   That's the thing that he's talking about.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   It is the righteousness which is by faith. It is God's righteousness.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   He's not merely saying, "Look here, don't argue about days and about meats and about drinks and so on.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   All that matters is that a man should live a good life and that he should be rather a quiet, peaceful fellow
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   and that he should be easygoing and more or less happy."
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   That isn't what the apostle is saying if he said that. He'd be denying his own gospel.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   No, no. He's talking about the righteousness of God, the righteousness which is by faith in Jesus Christ,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   this glorious thing without which there is no entry into the kingdom of God.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   And we can therefore look at it like this, if you like.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   You can observe every day in the week, if you like, but it'll never make you a Christian.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   You can abstain from all meats and from various drinks.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   You can fast and sweat and pray, but you'll never enter the kingdom of God.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   The kingdom of God is not things like that. That's not the way into the kingdom.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   That's not the foundation and the basis of the kingdom.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   "Stop talking about them," he says. "Stop putting them in the centre.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Those things will never bring you in.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   You can be perfect in all those things, as I was once as a Jew and a proud Pharisee.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   But I came to see that it was all but filthy rag.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   There's only one righteousness that admits into the kingdom of God.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   It is the righteousness that God himself provides in the person of his only begotten Son.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   If you want to be clothed, says the apostle, don't have your various badges upon you.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Appear ever in the cloak of righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   So that when men and women look at you, they don't see this or that ribbon or this or that decoration.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   They see the robe.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   The robe of the Lord Jesus Christ, the righteousness which God has provided for us.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   How can you elevate these other things into the central positions, says the apostle,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   when this is the only thing that matters?
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   This is something of which we can be and must be absolutely certain.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   That no man has any merit of his own.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   That there is no righteousness in men that avails to the slightest extent in the presence of God.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   That all our righteousness is but as filthy rags.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   And all our excellencies are but dung and loss and refuse in the sight of the holy and of the eternal.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Let not a man boast in days or eating and drinking or anything he's done or hasn't done.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Nothing matters. All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   The whole world lieth condemned before the eternal.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Righteousness.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   The apostle was amazed at these people.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   And as I suggested, he was almost losing his patience with them.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   He couldn't understand the mentality that can be looking at the other things while this is there.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   He comes back to it. He thrills at the thought of it.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   It isn't that it's this righteousness, this glorious thing that God has provided.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   And yet here are people who believe that, who are drifting back to these other things, these secondary things.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   They're putting them in the centre.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   No, no.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   There is nothing that is foundational and central save justification by faith only.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And isn't this the tragedy of the church today?
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   That men are giving their time and their energy to talking about these other things.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   As if the kingdom of God and the church of God were just particular attitudes towards particular questions.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   And this is never mentioned.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Whether you're a pacifist or whether you fight, it doesn't matter.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   It's the righteousness of Christ that alone takes you into the kingdom of God.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   This is the determining thing.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And nothing less and nothing shorter.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   So the apostle, as it were, says to these people in Rome,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   "If you want to talk, well talk about the righteousness of God through Jesus Christ."
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Don't go down to the other matters about which you can't be absolutely certain in a final sense.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   But make certain of this, that a man is not relying in any sense upon himself,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   but relying only upon God's act in Christ, the free gift of God's grace.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Stay there. Talk about that.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   And then of course the next thing comes out of that, it's peace.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   What is this?
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Well, this is peace of conscience.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   This is the thing you ought to be enjoying, says the apostle, is peace.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Peace of mind. Peace of conscience.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   You know, these people who are always agitated about the secondary and the third-rate matters,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   they're never really at peace. Their minds are in a turmoil.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   They always come and their brows are puckered and there they are,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   battling with this problem and they speak to you.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   There's no peace there.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   But the great characteristic of the Christian man should be that he's enjoying this peace.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   The apostle has already said it all in chapter 5.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Therefore he says, "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God."
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   The Christian is not a man who's saying, "Now I wonder if I observe that day rather than this,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   will that put me right? If I stop eating this or stop drinking that,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   and if I take up this, will that put me... is that the thing I want?"
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   You know, there are such people, and they're restless,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   and they rush around from meeting to meeting and convention to convention.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   They're looking for peace and they can't find it. Why?
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Well, it's always something they're going to do.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   They haven't realized that it's only obtained by this righteousness that is in Christ,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   and that it comes as a sequel to that.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Being justified by faith, we have peace with God.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   They're resting. Their hearts are at rest.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   They're no longer looking for something to do or some fresh experience to have.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   They're resting on the perfect work, and they're enjoying this peace with God.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   That's the kingdom of God.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Not this agitation about secondary matters.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Not this constant arguing and wrangling, always talking about these things.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   "Oh, the Christian is a man and a woman, and God grant that we may be such more and more."
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Who gives this impression always of peace with God?
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Peace in the conscience, peace in the mind, rest of soul.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And, of course, that happens also with our fellow men and women.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   These other matters always lead to argumentation, disputation, and wrangling,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   and that causes division, causes people to stumble, as the apostle says.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   But, you know, my friends, if you talk to people about peace with God,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   you'll give them peace as well.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Don't spend your time, says the apostle, in always talking about these other things.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   You're only upsetting people.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Talk to them about the things that lead to peace.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Let them see that you're enjoying it.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Let them see that you want them to enjoy it.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Look at this brother for whom Christ died.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Be concerned about his mind, his heart, his soul, his peace.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Talk to him about these things, not about these other doubtful matters,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   which can only lead him to increasing perplexity.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   In the kingdom of God, says the apostle,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   all men and women realize that they're equally hopeless and equally helpless.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   They don't look to what they've done or what they're proposing to do.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   They all look together to Christ and they rejoice in him.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   And there they're enjoying his blessed peace and they're at peace with one another.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   They're no longer autonomous beings filled with jealousy and rivalry,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   concerned about themselves and their own right opinions.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   No, no. They're there together at his feet, worshipping him, adoring him.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   They're one, righteousness and peace.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   And finally, joy in the Holy Ghost.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   What a wonderful thing this is.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   This doesn't merely mean that you get pleasure because you are right and everybody else is wrong.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   That's not joy.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   It isn't self-satisfaction because you are so wonderful,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   because you don't do this and you don't do that and you're doing this or not doing that.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   No, no. That's never real joy.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   There's no enlargement of heart there.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   There's something narrow about it.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   And there's always an element of bitterness in it.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   But that isn't the Christian, says Paul.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   The Christian is one who has joy in the Holy Ghost, by which he means this.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Joy produced by the Holy Ghost.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   For the Holy Ghost always gives joy.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Wherever he is, these things manifest themselves.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   But they are not present when men and women are in the condition of these people in the church at Rome.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   And yet you and I are called to manifest this joy.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   This is the thing we are to stand for.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   This is the thing we are to radiate and to produce in others.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   The Holy Spirit always does it.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Well, how does he do it? He does it like this.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Where he is present, he always leads people to rejoice
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   and to joy in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   You see, you're not rejoicing about your opinions now, you're rejoicing in him.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   And what a difference there is.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   You'll never get real joy merely in opinions.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   I say they have their importance, but don't make them central.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Don't let them conceal the person of the Lord and your joy in him.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Let people see that you're rejoicing in him.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Oh yes, you've got these opinions, but they're not first, they're second, they're third, they're fourth.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   He is at the center, and you give an impression that you know him,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   that you rejoice in him, that you love him, and that you're living for him.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Joy in the Holy Ghost.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Joy in the knowledge that your sins are forgiven.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Joy in the knowledge of the fact that you're a child of God.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Joy that results from communion with God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Joy in the Holy Ghost.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   He alone can give this.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Nobody has it but the Christians.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Other people have their opinions and arguments, and that's the impression they give you.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   But the Christian is a man, says Paul, who is to give this impression that he is rejoicing in his fellowship with God.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   He is lifted up above the world.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   He knows the Father.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   He knows the Son.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   He is rejoicing in them and with them, and he lives a life of communion and fellowship with them.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   And then joy in the realization of what awaits us.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Oh, this is the Christian.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   In this dark, sinful, troubled world, with wars and rumors of wars,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   and men and women happy, unhappy, and their hearts failing them as they think of the things that may come to pass,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   they have no joy, they cannot.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   But the Christian has.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   He knows of another realm, another world.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   And he knows that he is going to it, and that nothing can ever prevent his getting there.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   He knows of an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   reserved in heaven by God for him.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   And he rejoices in it.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   He looks at it.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   He dwells upon it.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   He meditates upon it.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   The Holy Spirit gives him views and glimpses of it.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   These are the things that matter to him.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   He doesn't spend his time in arguing and wrangling about days and times and seasons,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   and meats and drinks, and this and that, and his own opinions and deductions.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   No, no. It's the Lord, his righteousness, the peace that he's brought,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   the joy that he gives, and the glory that is yet to come.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   What do we talk of, my friends?
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   What impression do we give to others?
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   These are the tests.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   What are the things that are on the tip of our tongues?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   What are the things that come out first?
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   The moment we begin to talk to fellow Christians,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   are we always involved in some argument and disputation?
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Are we always with these secondary matters?
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Or do we delight essentially and always and first and foremost in talking about him,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   in looking at the robe of righteousness,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   in the peace that he's given us,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   and in the joy of belonging to him,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   and the fellowship that we so frequently have with him?
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   God forbid that we should be people who give the impression
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   that the kingdom of God is meat and drink.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   It is righteousness, peace, joy in the Holy Ghost.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   With the great apostle, we must be concerned about these other matters.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   We must help one another.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   But I say, God forbid that we should ever elevate them into centralities
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   and thereby hide righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Amen.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
