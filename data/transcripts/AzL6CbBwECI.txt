[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   - If you fought Jake Paul right now, what would happen?
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.800]   - I would knock him the fuck out, bro.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.240]   He's not B2B, bro.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.680]   - He didn't try to organize that fight?
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.800]   Or is he not trying to fight you?
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.140]   - Nah, I don't think he's trying to fight me, bro.
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.040]   - But if y'all got real beef and you're closer to his weight,
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.880]   like, why not?
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.320]   - I feel like we should run that, right?
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.180]   Me and his brother got a little something on.
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.520]   He sued me for coming out.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.120]   I said shit about Prime.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.580]   - Little stuff like that, I feel like--
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.520]   - That'll make it bigger, yeah.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.300]   - That'd be dope.
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.020]   - Nah, but I think it's like a petty thing.
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.260]   Nah, we don't want to give him money or whatever.
