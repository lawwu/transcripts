[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   So time and space are emergent.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:12.240]   We kind of mentioned in the beginning, can you elaborate, what do you feel hope is fundamental
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.000]   in our universe?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.800]   A wave function living in Hilbert space.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.560]   A wave function in Hilbert space that we can't intellectualize or visualize really.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.760]   We can't visualize it, we can intellectualize it very easily.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.840]   Like how do you think about...
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.600]   It's a vector in a 10 to the 10 to the 122 dimensional vector space.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.360]   The complex vector unit norm, it evolves according to the Schrodinger equation.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.040]   Got it.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.520]   When you put it that way.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.520]   What's so hard really?
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.520]   It's like...
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.520]   Yep.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Yep.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:58.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:08.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
