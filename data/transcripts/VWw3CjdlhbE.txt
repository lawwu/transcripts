[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   It's our fourth meeting of intermediate biblical counseling, and we're just thrilled that you
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.820]   have joined us tonight in our study of God's Word, and we're excited to continue our look
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.280]   at these ACBC exams.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.320]   And we are on a webinar format tonight, so if you have any questions about the material
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.200]   as we go along, feel free to use the chat function or the Q&A function, and we will
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.080]   be able to address any questions that you might have.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.040]   So welcome again, hope you had a great week, and that the Lord is blessing your life and
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.640]   your ministry.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.520]   And once again, it's just a privilege to be a part of what God is doing in your lives
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.080]   as you train to be biblical counselors, and as you work through these essay exams, we
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.520]   trust that this will be a very enriching experience for all of you, and that you will be equipped
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.760]   to minister God's Word to those who are in need of hope and help from the Word of God.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.640]   So to open tonight, I'd like to read from Psalm 19, and I'd like to read from the Psalm
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.280]   in entirety, and this is going to set the foundation for our study tonight.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.020]   Psalm 19 is going to be the key text that we will be looking at tonight as it relates
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.120]   to general revelation and special revelation, and it's also a great Psalm for us to begin
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.880]   with just to set our hearts and our minds on the study of God's Word.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.060]   So let me read from Psalm 19, and if you have your Bibles, go ahead and follow along.
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.560]   This is a Psalm of David, and he begins in verse 1, saying, "The heavens are telling
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.940]   of the glory of God, and their expanse is declaring the work of his hands.
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.620]   Day to day pours forth speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.660]   There is no speech, nor are there words.
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.780]   Their voice is not heard.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.580]   Their line has gone out through all the earth, and their utterance is to the end of the world.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.940]   In them he has placed a tent for the sun, which is as a bridegroom coming out of his
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.400]   chamber.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.180]   God rejoices as a strong man to run his course.
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.880]   Its rising is from one end of the heavens, and its circuit to the other end of them,
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.720]   and there is nothing hidden from its heat.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.600]   The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.560]   The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.540]   The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.440]   The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.080]   The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.120]   The judgments of the Lord are true, they are righteous altogether.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.160]   They are more desirable than gold, yes, than much fine gold, sweeter also than honey and
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.920]   the drippings of the honeycomb.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.520]   Moreover by them your servant is warned, in keeping them there is great reward.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.680]   Who can discern his errors, acquit me of hidden faults.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.840]   Also keep back your servant from presumptuous sins.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.840]   Let them not rule over me, then I will be blameless, and I shall be acquitted of great
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.760]   transgression.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.120]   Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.000]   Lord, my rock and my redeemer."
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.920]   Now, if you look at this psalm, you see that this is really a psalm that gives testimony
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.900]   to the power of God's word to transform a person's life.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.180]   You have six words used in verses seven to nine to describe the written word of God,
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.240]   the Holy Scriptures.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:03.520]   They are law, statutes, precepts, commandment, fear, and rules.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.480]   One commentator has observed that the synonyms are not to be studied in abstraction, but
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:18.240]   give a comprehensive emphasis that all of the words of the Lord are beneficial.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.460]   So used together, those six terms in verses seven to nine emphasize the multidimensional
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.560]   nature of the Holy Scriptures and the truth that the written word of God speaks with divine
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.560]   authority.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.920]   Now, if you'll look at this psalm, you see that the first half of Psalm 19 really focuses
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.040]   on God's revelation of himself in creation.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.720]   Verse one says, "The heavens are declaring of the glory of God and their expanse is declaring
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.500]   the work of his hands."
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.360]   This revelation that's found in creation is not subtle.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.800]   It's not restrained.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.720]   The text doesn't say that the heavens are whispering of the glory of God or that the
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.560]   heavens are suggesting that possibly a God exists who made all these things.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:23.440]   It says there that the heavens are telling of the glory of God and their expanse is declaring
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.160]   the work of his hands.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.140]   So the created order proclaims on a day-to-day basis that there is a God and that God is
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.200]   indeed powerful.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.320]   You see in verse two that this revelation never ceases.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:48.560]   He says, "Day to day pours forth speech and night to night reveals knowledge."
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   And then in verse four, it says that the revelation that is found in creation goes out to every
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.640]   man indiscriminately, every person who lives on this earth.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.760]   Verse four, "Their line has gone out through all the earth and their utterances to the
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.260]   end of the world."
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:17.200]   So every man who has ever lived in every part of the world has received God's revelation
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:24.720]   in creation, and he has received this revelation every day of his life.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.240]   Day to day pours forth speech and night to night reveals knowledge.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.800]   So verses one to six really focus in on God's revelation in creation.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.980]   Now in verse seven, you have what has been called a sudden transition.
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:50.920]   There is an abrupt break in thought and the psalmist here transitions very abruptly from
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:57.940]   God's revelation in creation to God's revelation in the scripture.
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:04.620]   So we go from how God has revealed himself in the created order and the sun, moon, stars,
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:13.220]   and planets, and all that lives on the earth, to how God has revealed himself in the written
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.900]   scriptures.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:23.420]   And the psalmist transitions from the heavens and the expanse to verse seven, "The law of
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:31.920]   the Lord, the testimony of the Lord, the precepts of the Lord, the commandment of the Lord."
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:41.640]   So this psalm is about the revelation of God, it is about God revealing himself in creation
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.660]   and then God revealing himself in the written scripture.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:54.380]   Now just focus in on, for a moment, verse seven and we'll look at verses seven to nine
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.380]   for a moment.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:04.000]   Notice the phrase, "of the Lord, of the Lord" repeated six times in verses seven to nine.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.320]   And that phrase is emphasizing the personal nature of scripture.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:17.740]   It is God's word, it is the law of the Lord, the commandment of the Lord.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:25.360]   And the psalmist gives testimony to the powerful effects of the written scriptures on a person's
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   life.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:33.980]   It says that the written scriptures revive the soul, make wise the simple, rejoice the
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:44.000]   heart, enlighten the eyes, the scriptures endure forever, and are righteous altogether.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:52.040]   Now I just want to note one thing in this psalm and this has relevance to biblical counseling.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:09:00.800]   We'll note here that the first time the word "soul" is used in Psalm 19 is in verse seven.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:08.920]   The word "soul" is not used in verses one to six as it relates to God's general revelation
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.200]   in creation.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:19.220]   God's general revelation in creation does not have the effect of being able to transform
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.180]   the soul.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:29.380]   The first time we have testimony of the revelation of God having the impact upon a person's life
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:36.640]   where that person's soul is revived and transformed is in verse seven when it speaks of the law,
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.080]   the testimony, the precepts, and the commandment.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:49.100]   Verse seven, "the law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul."
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:54.120]   Put simply, and we'll get more into this tonight in our handout, but just to open our time
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:01.800]   together, we learn from this psalm that the scriptures are God's written revelation to
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:11.620]   man that provide soul transformation and the ability to change and transform the souls,
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.960]   the soul of man.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.480]   This is soul care.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:27.240]   The true soul care is being able to minister the scriptures to a person's life.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:33.160]   And so commentator Peter Craigie says that the scripture is the fundamental force restoring
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:40.280]   to full vigor and vitality to the flagging spirit of mankind and providing him with the
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:46.840]   enduring inner food without which life cannot be fully lived.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:55.020]   We come to the scriptures because our souls are in need of revival.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.440]   Our souls are in need of encouragement.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:04.760]   We come to the scriptures with our weary souls, with our distracted souls.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:13.720]   We come to the scriptures with our noisy souls and the scriptures speak into our lives.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:20.800]   And it is the Bible and the Bible alone that has the power to transform the soul.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:29.280]   Biblical counseling is soul care and to be equipped in scripture is to be able to minister
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.960]   to people's hearts and lives in a way that they can be changed from the inside out.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:40.400]   I want you to keep Psalm 19 in mind as we go through tonight's study on general revelation
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.360]   and special revelation.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:49.000]   The categories of general revelation versus one to six and then special revelation versus
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.160]   seven to fourteen are going to be the categories that we're going to look at in some depth
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:00.080]   and also reference with some other scriptures in the New Testament.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.480]   But these are the basic categories that we're going to be looking at tonight as we look
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.880]   at theology exam number four.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.160]   So let's pray together and we'll dive right in.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.840]   And thank you again for joining us tonight and we pray that this will be an encouragement
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.400]   to you.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.400]   So let's pray.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.560]   Father, thank you for your word.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:26.200]   We thank you that your word is law, it is precept, it is commandment.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:33.040]   We thank you that it is testimony of who you are and all that you have done for us in redemptive
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.840]   history.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.240]   We thank you for revealing yourself in creation.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.800]   We thank you that the heavens declare the glory of God and day to day the heavens pour
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:51.080]   forth speech, but we thank you even more that you have revealed yourself to us in the Bible,
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:56.360]   in the written scriptures, that it is as we study and understand and hear the word of
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:03.360]   God that our hearts and our lives are transformed for time and for eternity.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:09.480]   And so tonight as we look at this essay topic of general revelation versus special revelation,
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.280]   I pray that you would help us to think clearly.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:18.120]   I pray that you would help us to understand this topic, not only so that our own souls
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:25.400]   may rejoice in the greatness of your word, but also that you would help us to cling to
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:31.840]   the sufficiency of scripture for counseling ministry and that you would help us to navigate
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:38.840]   and to interact with those who might hold to an integrationist view of counseling, that
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:45.280]   we would understand the arguments that are being made for such a view and that we would
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:52.480]   be able to wisely, with discernment, give a biblical response that the sufficiency of
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.680]   scripture might be upheld and promoted in our lives and in our churches.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.180]   So bless each of our students tonight.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.980]   Thank you for them, and we give this time to you in Jesus' name.
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.980]   Amen.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:05.980]   Amen.
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:09.200]   Well, go ahead and take a look at your handout.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.840]   We're going to dive into our study tonight.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.640]   We're looking at theology exam number four, which is a question on general revelation
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.140]   and special revelation.
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.840]   And on page one of your handout, we can read the essay topic together.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:28.300]   The question says this, "Define general revelation and special revelation and describe the nature
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:34.040]   of their authority as well as their relationship to one another."
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:41.160]   And on page one of your handout, I've suggested some reading for you from the works of theology.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:46.720]   And then I've also included a Dropbox folder in the email that I sent you that contains
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:53.820]   a good article by Sam Stevens, who is the ACBC Training Center director, and he has
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.080]   a good work on general revelation.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.080]   I encourage you to read that.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:07.820]   And I've also included an article by John H. Coe, who is an integrationist author and
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.840]   will interact with this article as we go along tonight.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:19.280]   But if you move to page two of your handout, we want to begin with the general idea of
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.360]   revelation.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.880]   What is the revelation of God?
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:29.400]   And Paul Enns writes this, "The word revelation is derived from the Greek word apokalipsis,
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.840]   which means disclosure or unveiling.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.760]   Hence revelation signifies God unveiling himself to mankind.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.320]   Revelation may be defined as that act of God whereby he discloses himself or communicates
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:51.720]   truth to the mind, whereby he makes manifest to his creatures that which could not be known
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.800]   in any other way.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:59.320]   The revelation may occur in a single instantaneous act or it may extend over a long period of
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.680]   time.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:05.680]   And this communication of himself and his truth may be perceived by the human mind
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.680]   in varying degrees of fullness."
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:15.680]   The important emphasis here is that God discloses truth about himself that man would not otherwise
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.200]   know.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:25.800]   So this is not the idea of man discovering who God is through man's investigation and
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.180]   man's labors.
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:33.760]   This is really the idea of God himself taking the initiative to disclose the truth of who
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.280]   he is to mankind.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:44.420]   The idea of initiative is really important in this discussion of revelation.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:50.960]   God has taken the initiative to disclose to us who he is.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.120]   Henry Thiessen agrees with the statement of Paul Enns.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:17:00.080]   Thiessen writes this, "God's revelation is that act of God whereby he discloses himself
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:06.240]   or communicates truth to the mind, whereby he makes manifest to his creatures that which
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.600]   could not be known any other way."
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.760]   So let me just address the practical question tonight, which is simply this, why do I need
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:23.720]   to understand this topic if I want to be an ACBC certified biblical counselor?
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:30.720]   What does this topic have to do with the ministry of biblical counseling and why do I need to
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:38.000]   navigate my way through the issues of general revelation and special revelation?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.080]   And the simple answer is this, that ACBC wants to certify biblical counselors who believe
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.320]   and uphold the sufficiency of Scripture for counseling ministry.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:59.600]   This essay is really asking you to respond to one of the leading arguments of integrationism.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:07.000]   And one of the leading arguments of integrationism is the idea that in order to really help people
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:15.480]   with their problems, we need to use both general revelation and special revelation to help
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.600]   people change.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.260]   In essence, what the integrationist would say is that you have general revelation, which
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:31.520]   is secular psychology, and then you have special revelation, which is the Scriptures, and you
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:38.280]   need to use both general and special revelation to help people change, therefore we must use
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:46.180]   both secular psychology and the Bible and combine them into a type of hybrid.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:53.040]   Many integrationists may also say that if you only give people special revelation, that
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:19:01.680]   is, the Bible, and you don't give them general revelation, that is, secular psychology, then
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:07.760]   you're really robbing people of the resources that they need to really help people change
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.880]   because we need to use, the basic argument would say, we need to use both general and
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.080]   special revelation.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:22.920]   Now I've included in your Dropbox folder this week an article from John H. Coe, who is a
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:29.760]   Christian integrationist, and Coe's article argues that we should use both general revelation
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:37.200]   and special revelation in counseling ministry, what he calls revelation both above and below
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.320]   the sun.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:44.440]   And on page two of his article, Coe writes this, and I'll just briefly quote this for
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.880]   you.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:53.680]   He says that, "Propositional revelation alone is inadequate insofar as it is incapable of
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.800]   saving a single soul.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:04.120]   The Bible does not intend to supplant the wisdom available from natural revelation,
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:09.560]   but only to perfect it, bringing it to its telos or goal in Christ.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:16.460]   Thus the Bible provides the divine interpretation of aspects of history and nature, but alone
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:20.360]   it is insufficient."
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:28.660]   So very clearly there, John H. Coe is saying that the scriptures alone are insufficient
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:34.120]   to really meet people where they are and really help them with their problems.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:39.920]   We must use both general revelation and special revelation, thus we must use both the best
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:46.280]   of secular psychology and the best of the Bible and combine them in a hybrid to help
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.000]   people change.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:57.760]   It's really that central argument for integrationism that ACBC is asking you to respond to in theology
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.200]   exam number four.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:09.360]   We present a model for counseling at ACBC that holds that we focus and we use special
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:14.320]   revelation, the scripture, to help people change.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:21.320]   And we are zeroed in on special revelation, that is the scripture, and our central tenant
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:27.360]   is that we don't need secular psychology to help people with the issues of life.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:34.700]   And as we go forth, go on in this study, I hope you'll see how theologically this makes
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:41.120]   sense and then how also practically this presents a model where we major on the Bible and we
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:47.120]   use the Bible to minister to the issues of life.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:52.780]   So that is why this topic is included in the essay exams.
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:22:00.800]   We're asking you to interact with and respond to a leading argument for integrationism,
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.740]   and that's why theology exam number four is so important.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.640]   So let me just underscore the broader concept of revelation for a moment.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:14.800]   On your handout there, you have Deuteronomy 29, verse 29, which says, "The secret things
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:21.160]   belong to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:27.360]   children forever, that we may do all the words of the law."
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:33.400]   That is a passage that references the idea of special revelation, the things that are
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.280]   revealed belong to us.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:43.440]   And the passage also says that the secret things belong to the Lord our God.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:49.920]   Scriptures are sufficient for life and godliness, but the scriptures are not exhaustive, telling
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.480]   us everything that could possibly be known.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.600]   God's knowledge is infinite and his wisdom is infinite.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:04.200]   And as much as he's given us in the scriptures, he has not revealed to us everything that
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.160]   there is to know.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.280]   It's really a staggering thought, and I'll restrain myself for a moment tonight.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.560]   I'm going on a rabbit trail there, but it's really a staggering thought to think that
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:23.280]   as much as God has revealed to us, that the secret things belong to him.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.680]   Matthew 11 also references the concept of revelation.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.640]   Verse 25, Jesus says, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:37.240]   these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.840]   Yes, Father, for such was your gracious will.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.160]   All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:54.560]   the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son chooses
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.580]   to reveal him."
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:03.440]   So under the umbrella of the larger theme of revelation, we have general revelation
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.160]   and we have special revelation.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.880]   Now in your handout, it says there that by general revelation, we are primarily talking
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.840]   about God's revelation in creation and in conscience.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.560]   God's revelation in creation and in conscience.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:28.560]   For the purposes of this class, I'm really going to major on God's revelation in creation.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:36.440]   You can look up God's revelation in conscience in Romans chapter 2, but I'll focus here on
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.520]   God's revelation in creation.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:48.360]   The basic idea being that God has disclosed certain truths about who he is through the
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:53.560]   creation that God has made.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:25:01.660]   God has disclosed certain truths about who he is through the creation that he has made.
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:09.640]   And this revelation is given to the entire world as we read in Psalm 19, and it is general
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.640]   in nature.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:18.680]   It proclaims to man that God exists, that God is powerful, that God is wise, but it
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:25.320]   does not contain specific truths about who God is, such as God is a holy trinity, or
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.760]   God is merciful, God is faithful.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:35.100]   Those are specific truths that are found in special revelation, the scriptures, but general
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:42.740]   revelation proclaims to every man everywhere, certain general truths about who God is.
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:51.260]   And then special revelation is God's revelation of himself in the scripture and in his son,
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.780]   Jesus Christ.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:59.600]   And for the purposes of this class, we'll focus in on God's revelation of himself in
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:08.720]   the scriptures, going back to Psalm 19, which is the key text in contrasting general revelation
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.480]   with special revelation.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:18.560]   If you look at the bottom of your handout on page 3, Psalm 19, starting in verse 1,
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.740]   as I read at the beginning of class, it said, "The heavens declare the glory of God and
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:27.600]   the sky above proclaims his handiwork."
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:36.400]   The created order makes a bold, authoritative proclamation to every man everywhere, living
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:44.660]   on planet earth, that there is a God and that God is amazing.
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:53.640]   General revelation proclaims to every man everywhere that God is powerful, God is glorious,
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.700]   and that God exists.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:01.720]   Day to day pours out speech and night to night reveals knowledge.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:09.020]   If you look at the next page of your handout, and I think this is page 3, we note that general
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.780]   revelation is general in content.
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.820]   It is general in content.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.520]   The heavens declare the glory of God.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:25.460]   The term God translates the Hebrew word El, which is the most generic of all names for
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.460]   God.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.700]   So as I mentioned, general revelation does not tell us about God the Father, God the
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.760]   Son, or God the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:42.780]   It does proclaim to us the truth of God's power and God's glory.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:48.060]   General revelation does not tell us about the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.940]   on the cross.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:54.060]   General revelation does not tell us about the doctrine of the Holy Spirit or the doctrine
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.260]   of the church.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:06.440]   What general revelation does is it proclaims to the world that God exists and God is glorious.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:12.040]   So I love how John Piper put it, that the created order proclaims a sermon that goes
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:20.160]   on 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and the sermon is basically this, God is glorious.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.320]   God is glorious.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:32.080]   That refrain is repeated every day, every hour, every month of the year, for as long
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:42.120]   as man has existed, general revelation has proclaimed to man that God is glorious.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:50.120]   This is a declaration of the heavens, not a suggestion by the heavens.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.680]   There's nothing unclear about God's general revelation.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.920]   There's nothing that is wrong with God's revelation.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:05.480]   The question is, what does man do with God's revelation in creation?
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:13.320]   And Romans 1 verse 19 tells us what man does with God's general revelation.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:20.080]   Paul says in verse 19, "For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.520]   shown it to them."
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.520]   He's talking about general revelation.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:31.160]   God has shown man who God is through the created order that he has made.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:37.920]   Paul continues, "For his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power and divine nature,
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:45.720]   have been," here it is, "they have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.440]   in the things that have been made."
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.600]   So they are without excuse.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   Now, remember, God's general revelation in creation is clear.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.100]   It is loud.
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.480]   It is continuous.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:10.380]   It is declarative in nature.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.240]   It goes out to all the earth.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.960]   It goes out to every man everywhere.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.120]   The problem is not with God's general revelation.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:26.200]   The problem is what man does with this revelation.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:35.760]   Paul says that man receives this general revelation and he is without excuse, but what he does
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:42.800]   with that general revelation is he suppresses the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:52.480]   The problem is that man is so blinded by his sin that he will take all of this clear revelation
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:31:02.200]   that is given in creation and he will say, basically, "No, no, no, no, no," suppressing
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:08.800]   the truth in his heart in unrighteousness, and instead of bowing down to the true and
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:16.700]   the living God as revealed in creation, man will exchange the glory of God for an idol
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:23.240]   and actually use his intelligence to argue away the existence of God and conclude that
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:29.480]   it all came out of a big bang or it all came out of nothing.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.520]   The point is this.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:36.280]   No one comes to faith through general revelation.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.340]   No one comes to faith through general revelation.
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.720]   No one is saved by looking at the stars.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.160]   No one is saved by looking at the planets.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:52.240]   No one is saved by looking at the moon or by looking at an ocean or a mountaintop.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:32:01.800]   Men look at this revelation given by God and they suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:08.120]   Number two on your handout, general revelation is general in audience.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.000]   General revelation is general in audience.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.140]   Paul Lenz writes that no one is excluded from this revelation of God wherever man peers
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:23.540]   at the universe there is orderliness.
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:27.520]   Let me skip down to the bottom of your handout on page three.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:34.140]   This is a key point that I really want you to understand and to take to heart and then
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.920]   also to articulate in your essays.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.960]   The key point is this.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:44.800]   If you look at the book of Romans and as you look at how Paul deals with the subject of
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:54.920]   general revelation, we learned that general revelation is sufficient to condemn, but it
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.560]   is not sufficient to save.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:04.080]   General revelation is sufficient to condemn and to leave men without excuse, but it is
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:10.780]   not enough to bring man to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:18.060]   For that, man needs special revelation in the scripture.
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:22.920]   You might say, "Well, what about the person who is in a certain country and they don't
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:29.120]   have a Bible and no missionary went to them to give them the gospel?
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.180]   Is that person at fault?"
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:38.640]   Romans once would say that that person is without excuse.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.160]   They were given revelation from God.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:46.940]   They were given general revelation, but they suppress the truth in unrighteousness and
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.080]   so they are without excuse.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:56.760]   Now the missionary call of the church of course is to make disciples of all the nations, baptizing
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.180]   them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit and to take the
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:07.480]   gospel to the ends of the earth so that man would believe in Christ and be saved.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:14.240]   But the point here is that no man can stand on the judgment day and say that, "Well, God,
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.160]   you never told me who you were.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.920]   God, you never told me about the truths of who you are."
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:30.740]   Every man everywhere has received the basic truths of who God is in general revelation.
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:35.700]   If you look at page four of your handout, you'll see the broader dynamics at work in
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.800]   Romans chapter one.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:45.280]   Paul says there in Romans 1 verse 18, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:50.040]   all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.360]   truth."
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.280]   So that's what all men do with general revelation.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:35:01.160]   They suppress the truth in unrighteousness, then watch the consequences of their rejection
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.660]   of general revelation.
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:11.080]   He begins, remember, that men receive revelation from God in creation.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.280]   They are left without excuse.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:19.840]   They suppress the truth in unrighteousness, and then there are consequences to this rejection.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.760]   As Paul explains in Romans 1 verse 21, "For although they knew God, they did not honor
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.960]   him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking and their
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.360]   foolish hearts were darkened."
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.920]   Verse 22 says, "Claiming to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:43.800]   immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things."
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:49.800]   And then as you read through the rest of the chapter, verse 24 says, "God gave them up."
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:54.200]   Verse 26 says, "God gave them up."
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:58.000]   Verse 28 says, "God gave them up."
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.360]   And eventually you end up in verse 32 where Paul says that men were filled with all manner
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.280]   of unrighteousness.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.120]   And Paul says they not only do acts of unrighteousness, but they gave approval to those who practice
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.840]   them.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:22.920]   That is a description of what happens to man when man rejects general revelation.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:32.280]   There are serious consequences to rejecting God's revelation of himself in creation.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:41.400]   What happens is that man ends up being given over to greater expressions of his sin and
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:50.800]   ends up in verse 32, not only practicing sin, but glorying in his shame and calling light
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:55.840]   darkness and darkness light.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:06.920]   And that is all the consequences of rejecting revelation in creation.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.680]   So someone's going to say at this point that if the problem is that man rejected general
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:21.040]   revelation, then in order to remedy the problem, we need to give man more general revelation.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:27.440]   That would be one approach to solving the issue.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:32.360]   What we need to do in order to reach men's hearts is we need to show them more of the
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:36.920]   stars and more of the heavens and more of the planets.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.720]   We need to show them more mountaintops, more oceans.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:49.960]   We need to show them more of the intricacies of the animal planets, the animal kingdom.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:54.360]   And if we just show people more general revelation, then that will melt their heart and they will
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.360]   come to the saving knowledge of the truth.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:05.720]   And scripture would disagree with that idea.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.720]   Scripture says that unbelievers have been given all the general revelation that they
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:18.200]   need to believe that there is a God and they exchange the truth of God for a lie and they
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.460]   give themselves over to idolatry.
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:30.280]   And you can't remedy man's rejection of general revelation by just giving man more general
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.280]   revelation.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:37.400]   So you say then, well, what's the remedy then?
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:45.280]   And that's where Psalm 19 verse 7 transitions from God's general revelation in creation
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:50.440]   to God's special revelation in the scripture.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:57.520]   Our hope lies in special revelation, the power of the scripture.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:05.160]   Psalm 19 verse 7, the law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:12.880]   Now just a note here, and this should just cause us to glory in the goodness of our God.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:21.720]   When man rejected God's general revelation in creation, God was under no obligation to
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:26.900]   give man any further revelation.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:32.720]   I hope you understand that and I hope you understand that this places us in a position
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:38.200]   where we ought to be filled with much gratitude and much praise to the goodness of God.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:46.120]   God was under no obligation to give mankind any further revelation when all men everywhere
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:51.060]   rejected his general revelation and suppressed the truth and unrighteousness.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:55.600]   He could have stopped right there and said, I've given you all that you need to know and
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:01.360]   you've rejected it and so I'm going to give you over to sin and no further revelation
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.220]   is going to be given.
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:12.020]   But the truth is our God is gracious and our God is a God of salvation.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:19.800]   We find that general revelation leads to condemnation, but special revelation, that is the scriptures,
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.880]   leads to salvation.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:31.440]   And God responded to man's rebellion in suppressing the truth and unrighteousness.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:38.120]   God was gracious and He was kind and He gave us His special revelation in the scriptures,
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:45.480]   which revealed to us the glory of the person and work of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:51.220]   Paul ends, writes that special revelation involves a narrower focus than general revelation
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:55.300]   and is restricted to Jesus Christ and the scriptures.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:59.800]   Of course, all that is known of Christ is through the scriptures, therefore it can be
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:05.920]   said that special revelation is restricted to the scriptures.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:11.020]   So he's just saying there that, I mean, you could say special revelation centers on the
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:16.480]   scriptures and Jesus Christ, but all that we know about Jesus Christ is found in the
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.480]   scriptures.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:24.800]   So practically speaking, you can say that special revelation is related to God's revelation
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:33.280]   in the word of God, the written word of God, the 66 books of the Bible.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:38.200]   So again, we refer to Psalm 19, "The law of the Lord revives the soul.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.320]   The testimony of the Lord makes wise the simple.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.560]   The precepts of the Lord revive the heart.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.960]   The commandment of the Lord enlightens the eyes.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.100]   The fear of the Lord endures forever.
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:55.020]   The rules of the Lord are righteous altogether."
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:42:01.940]   To counselors in training, I'm going to ask you to look at Psalm 19 verse 7 and ask yourself,
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:08.940]   what counseling issue is not addressed by the beneficial effects of the written word
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:13.060]   of God in those three verses?
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.620]   Are you weary and burdened?
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:19.080]   The word of God revives your soul.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.300]   Are you depressed and discouraged?
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:27.260]   The word of God rejoices the heart.
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.980]   Are you confused with life or have you lost your way?
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:38.420]   The word of God will be a lamp unto your feet and a light to your path.
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.420]   Are you immature?
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:40.700]   Are you foolish?
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.180]   Are you in need of spiritual growth?
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:50.760]   The word of God will give you wisdom and spiritual maturity.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:55.860]   There isn't a single counseling issue that is not broadly addressed by the beneficial
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:02.920]   effects of God's word in verses 7 to 9 of Psalm 19.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:08.320]   And this is very practical to us because as counselors, we minister to those who are discouraged
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:18.040]   and depressed, those who are in need of clarity in terms of life's direction, those who are
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:27.800]   downcast with the issues of life, even depressed as a result of sin and suffering, and sometimes
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.920]   it is more suffering than sin.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.800]   Sometimes it's suffering that is caused by sin.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   We minister to those who are foolish and who are in need of spiritual maturity, and the
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:44.880]   word of God will have all of these beneficial effects in our counselees' lives if we minister
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:52.600]   God's word and if we assign good homework that gets our counselees into God's word.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:44:01.760]   You know here that the scripture is pure, perfect, sure, right, pure, clean, and true.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:08.040]   The quality of scripture is therefore related to the character of God Himself.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:12.080]   The scripture is perfect because God is perfect.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.240]   The scripture is sure because God is faithful.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.620]   The scripture is right because God is righteous.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:25.480]   The scripture is pure because God is holy.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:31.960]   And in contrast to God's general revelation in creation, God's special revelation in scripture
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:38.320]   has the power to transform the soul.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:45.000]   So we don't really do anything new or novel in biblical counseling.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.400]   What do we do in biblical counseling?
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:55.200]   We meet with people, we love them well, we listen well, we show compassion.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.080]   We weep with those who weep, we rejoice with those who rejoice.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:07.760]   We seek to enter the counselee's world and see life through their eyes.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:13.360]   And then we open the Bible and we read the Bible together.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:19.360]   We ask the counselee to read scripture and then we ask them questions to see if they
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.200]   have understanding of the word of God.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:28.760]   And then we help them make personal application to their lives and then we assign good homework
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:36.080]   that gets them into the word of God for themselves, both daily Bible reading and corporate worship,
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:42.280]   the corporate hearing of God's word, Bible memorization, reading good books that get
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.160]   them into scripture.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:51.000]   And then we meet again and we repeat the process and we watch God work in counselee's lives.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.320]   There's nothing fancy about what we do.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:46:03.000]   There's nothing that's some kind of magic, a secret mystery about what we as biblical
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.400]   counselors do.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:11.400]   But what we do in all that is we unleash the power of the scripture in our counselees lives.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:17.720]   We get them into the word and we get the word into our counselees.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.760]   And as the word begins to do its work, we watch the beneficial effects of the word of
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:28.560]   God in our counselees lives, that the word of God revives the soul.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:31.040]   The word of God rejoices the heart.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:34.480]   The word of God makes wise the simple and so forth and so on.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:42.480]   The word of God changes lives and transforms people's hearts and lives.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:52.400]   And this is really based upon our understanding of general revelation and special revelation.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.720]   Our approach in biblical counseling is not to get people into more general revelation
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:05.800]   because general revelation is sufficient to condemn and to leave men without excuse before
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:13.680]   judgment, but not sufficient to convert the soul and to bring men and women to salvation
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.480]   and sanctification.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:22.360]   To bring men and women to salvation and then to sanctification conformity to Christ likeness,
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:27.620]   we must have special revelation, the scripture.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:34.820]   And so this essay is the basis to set the foundation of why we do what we do as biblical
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:38.140]   counselors.
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:44.300]   So some tips on writing this essay, if you're writing this essay this week or in the weeks
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:53.620]   to come, I'd encourage you to just start with defining revelation before you get into the
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.500]   specific concepts of general revelation and special revelation.
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:04.400]   Just define revelation, get that concept down, revelation, the disclosure of God about truths
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:13.340]   about himself, where he takes the initiative to tell man who he is.
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:18.980]   And secondly, you want to define general revelation.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:24.900]   I'd encourage you to spend some good time here defining the doctrine of general revelation.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:32.740]   Make sure to reference Psalm 19 verses one to six, which focused on general revelation,
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:39.460]   and then make sure to reference Romans one, what man does with this general revelation
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.580]   from God.
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:47.480]   And then the question asks you to describe the nature of their authority.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:52.660]   And the basic answer here is that both general revelation and special revelation are equally
[00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:59.860]   authoritative, although they have different effects.
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:04.660]   The results of the two types of revelation are different.
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:10.140]   General revelation leaves men condemned, while special revelation results in salvation and
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.140]   sanctification.
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:15.420]   But the two types of revelation are equally authoritative.
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:23.780]   Now move to page six of your handout, and I'll wrap this up and look at some applications,
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:29.580]   and then we'll send you on to have a great week writing this essay.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:33.140]   Number one, application on page six.
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:37.420]   Understand how general revelation and special revelation are both similar and distinct.
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:44.860]   They're similar in that they both come from God, they are distinct in their content.
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:49.900]   Special revelation reveals general truths about who God is.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:59.020]   Special revelation reveals specific truths about who God is, and they are also distinct
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.760]   in their result or their effect.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:08.740]   This is from the ACBC Standards of Doctrine, which you can look up on the ACBC website.
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:14.380]   The standard says this, "Special revelation is God's disclosure of himself to his people
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.060]   in the pages of scripture.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:21.940]   General revelation is God's disclosure of himself to the entirety of humanity in the
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:25.060]   things that have been made.
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:30.100]   General revelation and special revelation each come from God, and so are of equivalent
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.100]   authority."
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:39.660]   Now, you would do well to probably quote that standard of doctrine in response to the question.
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:45.900]   ACBC has given you the answers to the question right here in their Standards of Doctrine,
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:51.900]   where they say, "General revelation and special revelation are of equivalent authority, although
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.300]   they differ in content.
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:58.780]   Special revelation discloses detailed information about the character of God and how to live
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.900]   all of life in a way that honors him.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:07.700]   General revelation is a disclosure of the beauty and power of God, which leads to judgment.
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:11.940]   The subject matter of general revelation is the character of God, and not mere facts about
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.780]   the created order.
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:21.540]   General revelation requires special revelation to be properly understood and applied."
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:26.820]   Number two application, "Understand how integrationists are using the doctrine of general revelation,"
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:30.820]   as I mentioned earlier in our study.
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:37.620]   What they're saying here is that general revelation is equivalent to secular psychology, special
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:42.580]   revelation is equivalent to the scripture, so we need to combine both general revelation
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:49.740]   and special revelation in helping people change.
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:55.140]   Larry Crabb, who is an integrationist, has said this in Effective Biblical Counseling,
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.980]   "All truth is certainly God's truth.
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:02.220]   The doctrine of general revelation provided warrant for going beyond the propositional
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:07.500]   revelation of scripture into the secular world of scientific study, expecting to find true
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:12.140]   and usable concepts."
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:13.540]   So what's the problem here?
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.300]   And this is going to set up the next essay.
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:23.940]   We're going to talk more about this next week as we get into theology exam number five.
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:33.620]   But the problem here is that no secular unbeliever can study general revelation apart from the
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:40.660]   Holy Spirit and come up with accurate conclusions.
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:47.220]   No secular unbeliever accepts the truth of general revelation.
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:55.620]   Romans 1, they look at general revelation and they suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:53:00.820]   So this idea that we should study general revelation in purely secular terms and then
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:07.100]   study the scriptures and come up with a hybrid really has a faulty foundation because no
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:11.460]   unbeliever studies general revelation and comes up with the accurate conclusion that
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:17.160]   there is a God and He created everything and that He should be worshiped and praised forever
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.660]   and ever.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:27.840]   So that is a subject we'll look more at next week.
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.460]   This idea does not account for the secular understanding of general revelation that will
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.780]   be flawed due to the noetic effects of sin.
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.860]   We'll talk more about that next week.
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:41.300]   It also does not account for the limited nature of general revelation.
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:46.360]   General revelation does not reveal specific truths about who man is and how the heart
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:51.440]   relates to God.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:57.240]   So let me give you a third application and wrap this up.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:02.880]   Number three, understand that special revelation is the focus of biblical counseling.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.400]   So we are ministers of God's special revelation.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.240]   We are ministers of the book.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:15.380]   We do book work, we study, we read, we understand the Word of God, and then we teach others
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:20.060]   what the Word of God says.
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:25.400]   It is God's Word that is sufficient to save and it is God's Word that is sufficient to
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.280]   sanctify.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:31.920]   We focus in on God's special revelation because the goal of counseling is to change hearts
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.520]   and lives for God's glory.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:38.040]   So a final thought as we close.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:45.000]   Can I ask you tonight as counselors in training, are you more impressed with God's general
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:57.880]   revelation in creation, or are you more impressed with God's special revelation in the scripture?
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:07.260]   Are you more impressed by canyons, lakes, oceans, rivers, sun, moon, stars, and planets,
[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:16.380]   or are you more impressed with Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, 1st and 2nd Corinthians,
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:19.820]   and so forth and so on?
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:25.100]   Are you more impressed by the greatness and grandeur of the stars in the skies, or are
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:32.060]   you more impressed at the greatness of your salvation in Christ?
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:37.900]   And as I tell people in my church, if you're more impressed with general revelation than
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:45.260]   you are with special revelation, then you need to spend more time in God's special revelation
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:52.860]   in the scriptures, the inexhaustible ocean of truth that's found in God's Word.
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:57.860]   Is it any wonder that the psalmist concludes his treatment on general and special revelation
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:03.960]   in Psalm 19 by saying, verse 10, "More to be desired are they," that is the scriptures,
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:09.340]   "than gold, even much fine gold, sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:14.760]   Moreover by them, as your servant warned, in keeping them there is great reward."
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:27.040]   And then he concludes, watch this real carefully, he concludes with a statement of self-examination.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:32.200]   He says, "Who can discern his errors, declare me innocent from hidden faults, keep back
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:36.420]   your servant also from presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over me, then I
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:40.000]   shall be blameless and innocent of great transgression.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.440]   Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.040]   Lord, my rock and my redeemer."
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:56.640]   The psalmist's response to understanding special revelation was not, "Well, that's nice, and
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.180]   I'll read it so that I understand more."
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:05.680]   His response to God's special revelation was, "Lord, I need to be changed.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:09.280]   Lord, change me.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:14.720]   Examine my life according to the truth of your word and help me to live a life that
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:19.600]   is acceptable and pleasing to you."
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:21.060]   That's the power of God's word.
[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:23.760]   That's what we want to produce in our counselees.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:27.680]   And if we want to produce that in our counselees, then we ourselves need to be experiencing
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.200]   that as well.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:33.200]   So I pray that this study will be a blessing to your souls.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:39.120]   I pray that you will write a great essay on the subject of general revelation and special
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:45.760]   revelation, and that what this essay will cause you to do is to cling ever more tightly
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:52.400]   to the scriptures, to the word of God, in ministering to others through the issues of
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.400]   life.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:58.760]   What I'm going to do is I'm going to pray and officially close our webinar for tonight.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:01.660]   You're free to go at this point.
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:06.560]   If any of you have questions, I'll hang on for a few minutes afterwards, and I'll answer
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.160]   any questions that you might have.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:13.120]   But otherwise, Lord bless you, and have a wonderful week, and thank you for joining
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.120]   us tonight.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.120]   Let's pray together.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:21.520]   Father, thank you for your word, and we do pray that, Father, your word would change
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:28.960]   and transform our own lives first, and then, Lord, we might be servants who can use your
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.080]   word to minister to others.
