[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   I mean, the current answer is like China, right, where they're just building more concrete
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.120]   use in the last 20 years or whatever than the entire world's use in the time before
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.120]   that, right?
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.140]   Just like big, massive amounts of urbanization, a lot of like really interesting buildings
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.140]   and construction.
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.520]   I mean, just in terms of like raw output, right?
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.520]   I would also put like Japan in like the late 20th century on there, basically at the peak
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.280]   of like concern, like wonder, like, is Japan gonna take over the world?
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.880]   And they, you know, they were really interested in building their stuff quite quickly.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.800]   They spent a lot of time and effort trying to use their like robotics expertise to try
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.320]   to figure out how to build buildings a lot more quickly.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.360]   So they had these like really interesting factories that were designed to basically
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.560]   extrude an entire skyscraper just going up vertically.
