[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   On this podcast we talk a lot about sexual temptation and sexual sin because
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   there's a real need for frank talk about it and because the Bible has a lot to say as well.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   So what is lust? Pastor John gave a sharp and concise definition in his sermon,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   "Battling the Unbelief of Lust," which he preached 25 years ago. He was preaching from 1 Thessalonians 4,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   verses 1 through 8, and this is what he said.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   It says here in verse 4, "Do this," whether it's take a wife or whether it's control your body,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   "Do this in holiness, not in the passion of lust."
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Now holiness has to do with God. It has to do with being set apart for God, right?
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   We all know that basic biblical concept of being set apart for God.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Verse 5, "Therefore," goes on like this, "not in the passion of lust, like the heathen who don't know God."
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Lust comes from not knowing God, having no regard for God,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   not holding Him as the supremely holy one and important one in your life.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Look at verse 8, same point is going to be made here.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   "Therefore, whoever disregards this," namely this call for holiness,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   "Whoever disregards this call for holiness, disregards not man, but God, who gives His Holy Spirit to you."
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   So the root issue in lust is whether you regard God with your sexual desires.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Do you have a supreme regard for God or is God disregarded when it comes to lust or sexual desire?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   So here's my definition then of lust.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Lust is taking a perfectly good thing that God created, namely sexual desire,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   and abstracting it or stripping it off from an honor toward people, a person,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   and stripping it off from a supreme regard for God in holiness.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You take God away and you take the honor of man away, and what you've got left in sexual desire is lust.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   That's my definition.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   That clip was taken from John Piper's sermon, "Battling the Unbelief of Lust," preached back on November 13, 1988.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And for more on the root of sexual sin, see two episodes in this podcast series,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   episode number 396, "Why Sex is Not the Root of Sexual Sin,"
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and see also episode 304, "Visualizing Christ to Battle Lust."
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   You can find these and another 400 episodes in the podcast archive.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   But how do I get to the podcast archive, you ask?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Well, one of the easiest ways is through the Ask Pastor John app for the iPhone, the iPad, and the Android devices.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   In the updated app, you can access the entire archive of episodes, and you will see a search bar at the top of the screen.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   From here, you can search all of the titles.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And if you don't see these features in your app, be sure to update.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Also, you can tap and send us an email question of your own, all from the app that is free of charge to you.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Well, Pastor John has a new job title at Bethlehem Baptist Church, "Pastor Emeritus."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Tomorrow, he will explain what it means.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
