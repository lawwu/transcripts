[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words that are to be found
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.800]   in the first verse of the first chapter of the Gospel according to Saint Mark.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.320]   The first verse in the first chapter of the Gospel according to Saint Mark.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.480]   The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:33.080]   Now those are the words in which the evangelist Mark begins to state his Gospel.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.720]   And the way in which he does so is something that is really typical and characteristic
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.440]   of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.080]   He is presenting his message and that is the way in which he does it.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.160]   Now I say that this is very typical.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.960]   There's a note of joy, there's a note of confidence, there's a note of assurance.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.320]   He seems to be saying, "Listen, here is the commencement of this great and glorious
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.720]   and wonderful thing which I have to tell you."
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.400]   He doesn't waste his time with any introductions.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.200]   He at once begins with his great proclamation.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.520]   Now you'll find that the other writers do very much the same thing.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.320]   Matthew starts in his same way.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.880]   He gives us this genealogy which people may wonder why it's given.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.520]   But you see this is what he wants to say, the book of the generation of Jesus Christ,
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.560]   Son of David, Son of Abraham.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560]   He's again making a proclamation.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.720]   He's making a great announcement.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.520]   John, you remember, starts off saying, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.000]   with God, and the Word was God."
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.520]   That's his introduction to his gospel.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.680]   This I'm trying to show is the great characteristic of the presentation, the introduction of the
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.300]   great message of the New Testament everywhere and in all its books.
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.360]   You get exactly the same thing in the preaching of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.840]   It's an account of men going around the then known and civilized world making this proclamation,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.600]   proclaiming this gospel, this good news.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.360]   And that is why it's always true to say that there is no more lyrical, thrilling book known
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.680]   anywhere amongst men tonight than the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.080]   This was the way in which they all did it.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.640]   This is just one of the evangelists.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.880]   And he, as it were, bursts forth upon us and holds this thing before us, the beginning
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.520]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.120]   Now, they all felt the same, I say.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.120]   Listen to the Apostle Paul.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.500]   "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ," he says, by which he means, "I'm tremendously
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.500]   proud of it."
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.340]   He's writing to Rome, the seat of the imperial government, the place in which the emperor
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.300]   lived, the very heart and nerve center of that vast and most important empire.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.340]   He says, "I'm ready to come to Rome to preach the gospel."
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.340]   Why?
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.260]   "Well, because I'm not ashamed of the gospel.
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.260]   I'm proud of it.
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.420]   I'm ready to come and to speak it to anybody.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.660]   I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.700]   So as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also."
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.460]   He says, "I'm ready to preach it to anybody, anybody who's ready to listen.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.100]   I'm as ready to preach it to the emperor as I am to the humblest slave in the imperial
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.100]   palace.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:52.220]   I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.220]   that believeth."
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.660]   Indeed, he says, "Woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel."
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.660]   He must, and that's true, I say, of all these apostles and these New Testament writers.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.640]   They give us the impression that they've got this great and high privilege of telling people
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.820]   about the most wonderful thing that anybody can ever listen to.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.980]   And so they bring it to us with this tremendous note of urgency and of confidence and of assurance.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.820]   And indeed, this is not confined to the great preachers of the New Testament.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.980]   It's true of the ordinary believers, Christian people.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.780]   We read in the eighth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles that there was
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.060]   a great persecution at one point in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered abroad throughout
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.860]   the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles.
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.500]   And this is what we read.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:54.220]   "Therefore, they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word."
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.700]   They were glad of the opportunity.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.100]   It doesn't matter that they'd been persecuted and scattered.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.540]   The important thing to them was this, that they had an opportunity of telling people
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.340]   about this word, the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.420]   They had an opportunity of telling people, somebody says that can be translated "gossiping
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.700]   the word," telling people about it.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.880]   That was to them a wonderful opportunity, even their persecution and their scattering.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.860]   They turned into a victory because it gave them the opportunity of telling these strange
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.020]   people amongst whom they were scattered about this gospel, which really had caused them
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.340]   to be persecuted and which indirectly was therefore responsible for their present problems.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.860]   That was how they reacted.
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.140]   They went everywhere preaching the word.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.700]   They wanted everybody to listen to it.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.960]   They wanted everybody to believe it.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.980]   They were people who were excited about it.
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.140]   They said, "Listen to what we've got to say."
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.460]   Now that's what Mark is saying.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.900]   The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.060]   Now then, the question I want to put to you is this.
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.400]   Why was this?
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.320]   Why did Mark write his gospel?
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.400]   Why did any of the others?
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.980]   Why did the Apostle Paul say he was so ready to preach it in Rome?
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:15.260]   Why were all these men ready to grasp at any or every opportunity of making this thing
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.260]   known?
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.260]   Why?
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.700]   Now, that I think is the question that ought to be facing us.
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.260]   Should people still listen to this gospel?
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.060]   Are you being wise or unwise in listening to it here tonight?
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.460]   You know you're doing something that is rather unusual in this modern world.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.700]   The vast majority of the people of this country have ceased to listen to it.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.940]   They are intolerant with respect to it.
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.940]   They dismiss it.
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.740]   They say it is completely irrelevant.
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.780]   Now they're prepared to listen to other things.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.980]   They're prepared to read other things.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.300]   They're prepared to listen to speeches, addresses by politicians and others.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.540]   They're prepared to listen to lectures on various aspects of life and of living.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.140]   They're prepared to go and listen to lectures on art and of music and various other intellectual
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.020]   and aesthetic and artistic interests.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.100]   They claim to be very much concerned about these things and very interested in them.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.420]   The more they can hear about them, the happier they are.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:28.460]   But they feel that this gospel, that it's irrelevant, that it's remote, that it's got
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:34.200]   nothing to say to them, that it's almost an insult to ask a modern man to listen to it.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.420]   So the question I'm asking is this.
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:43.420]   Is this gospel as relevant as it was in the first century?
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.980]   Should I and others who are called to this task, should we have the same spirit animating
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.540]   us as we find in these New Testament preachers and writers?
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.820]   Should every Christian be reacting as the first Christians reacted?
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.660]   Have we still a right to ask the world to listen to us?
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.020]   Have we a right to invite the whole world to come and listen to this, say, "Listen,
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.020]   here's the beginning.
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:13.020]   Here is the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:19.460]   Now, I think that we are living at such a time and in such circumstances and conditions
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.820]   that we can't take this for granted.
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:28.300]   It is obvious, as I say, that the vast majority of people don't feel like this about it and
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.260]   don't want to hear it.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.660]   Why do we say to them that they should listen to it?
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.340]   Why do we go on with this particular work?
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.440]   Why do we say that the modern man is so wrong?
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.220]   Why do we say that he should listen to this gospel?
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:51.740]   Well, now, I want to try to answer that question by means of analyzing this first verse in
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.400]   the first chapter of this gospel according to St. Mark.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.900]   Why should men and women listen to this?
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.100]   Why should we be anxious to tell them what it tells?
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:08.620]   The first answer I find here is that it's because it is something that speaks to our
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:14.300]   need and speaks to our condition.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:19.300]   The beginning of the gospel, and that means good news.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.740]   Well, why is it called good news?
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.220]   Why does mankind need good news?
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.900]   Why has this always been represented as good news?
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.300]   Good news about what?
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:39.740]   Well, here is where we show how vital and relevant and necessary the gospel is today
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:45.140]   and how it is as necessary and as relevant as it's ever been.
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:50.860]   It is the word above every word tonight that is speaking to men and women in their greatest,
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.060]   their most real need.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:01.180]   It's because, of course, they've misunderstood that the people are no longer interested in
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.180]   it.
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.380]   Let me therefore put it like this.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:10.740]   The gospel of Jesus Christ is not some matter of speculative interest.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.740]   It's not just some theory or idea with respect to life.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.500]   It's not just one of a number of points of view.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.980]   It's not something that, well, a man can take it up or he can't take it up, as a man may
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.380]   be interested in art, as I say, or in music, or he may not be.
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.540]   You don't condemn a man because he's not interested in music or in art.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.660]   It's all right if he's made like that, and if he's not interested, you have no right
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.300]   to feist the thing upon him and ask him to listen to it.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.300]   Leave him alone.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.740]   He has a perfect right.
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.740]   He's got his interests.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.460]   He may like carpentry or something like that.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.660]   We'll let him do that.
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:52.420]   Now, I say that the gospel isn't something like that.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:57.820]   It isn't just something for men and women who are interested in problems.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.140]   There are people who are interested in problems of thought.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.140]   They're called philosophers.
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:06.220]   And they say they'd like to have some understanding of life.
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:12.700]   They say it's no use a man just taking things for granted and just allowing things to happen
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.700]   to him.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.300]   Surely a man's got intelligence and he ought to be trying to understand.
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:22.020]   And so from the beginning of time, men have tried to understand the riddle and the problem
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.020]   of life.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.620]   And they've put up their theories and ideas.
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:31.420]   And some people find great pleasure and enjoyment in looking at them, comparing them, and contrasting
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.180]   them, and arguing about them.
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.500]   They speculate, put up their theories and test them and their ideas, and so on.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.420]   Now, I say the gospel isn't like that.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:47.380]   It's not merely a kind of intellectual hobby or interest or entertainment.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.140]   Neither is it merely some emotional interest or entertainment.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.700]   But let me go further.
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:12:03.460]   The gospel is not even interested primarily in our temporal needs and material conditions.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:11.180]   Now, let me put this in this way, in the contemporary scene and situation.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.340]   I'm asking you to listen to this gospel.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.300]   There are many people in the world at this moment, in this country at any rate, who are
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.380]   asking us to listen to them.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.100]   You can't get away from it, can you?
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.500]   On your television, on wireless, or anywhere else, political broadcasts.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.340]   Listen to this party, listen to that party.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.140]   They want us to listen to them.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.140]   They're asking us to listen.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.140]   They've got something to say.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.940]   They've got a message, they say.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.540]   But what are they concerned about?
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:42.620]   Well, they're concerned essentially about our temporal and material conditions.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.100]   I know that it isn't only that, but it is essentially that.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.420]   That's what people are interested in fundamentally and primarily.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.940]   How are we to be governed during this next five years?
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.740]   How much money are we to have?
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.740]   What's to happen to us?
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.740]   And so on.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.820]   Well, they may say, "We're interested in your minds also.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.460]   We want you to have education.
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.020]   We want you to have houses, hospitals, and so on and so forth."
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.020]   And they say, "You should listen to us.
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.020]   You should listen to us."
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.940]   Each one says, "Listen to me.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.860]   Now I've got a program which can do better for you than the others can.
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.820]   So you ought to listen to what I've got to say.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.820]   Don't be foolish now.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:18.820]   Don't turn off.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:19.820]   Listen.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:20.820]   Keep on listening.
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.820]   This is important for you."
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.820]   That's their argument.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.580]   And it's important for the reasons that I've reminded you of.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:34.260]   Now, I'm just here to say this, that the Gospel is not in competition with any one
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.540]   of these things.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:42.500]   There are reasons for listening to this Gospel which are altogether more profound, more urgent,
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.300]   and more vitally important.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.380]   The Gospel addresses this on a deeper level.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:55.380]   And this is the first great reason why we should listen to it.
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.180]   What does it talk to us about?
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:02.020]   Am I speaking to somebody tonight who hasn't been in a place of worship perhaps for years,
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.740]   perhaps never before?
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.100]   Am I speaking to somebody who says, "Oh, that's stuff and nonsense.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.100]   I'm a realist.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.100]   I'm up to date.
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.060]   I'm prepared to listen to the politicians because they're going to do something."
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.060]   You are Gospel.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.460]   Well, I don't object to people if there are such people and there are about 10% still
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.220]   left who are interested in that sort of thing, who read their Bible and are interested in
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.220]   sermons.
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.220]   But I'm a man of affairs.
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.220]   I'm practical.
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.220]   I'm up to date.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.420]   I want something that really has got bite and kick and power in it.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.620]   I want something that's going to be of value to me.
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.580]   Am I addressing such a person?
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:38.540]   My friend, my reply to you is that you should listen to this above everything else, the
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:44.020]   beginning of this Gospel, the very essence of it, what it's all about for this reason,
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:52.140]   that it deals with life at its deepest and profoundest level.
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:59.620]   It is concerned about the things that matter most of all and that matter finally and fundamentally.
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.620]   What are they?
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.460]   Well, life itself.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.500]   You see, this is where you see the profundity of the Gospel.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:14.460]   Of course, let's agree, it is right that a man should live in a decent house.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.180]   Of course it's right.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.020]   Every man is entitled to live in decent and good conditions.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:26.500]   It is right that a man should have everything possible done to safeguard his health or to
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.380]   treat him if he's taken ill.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.940]   Certainly, it is the right of every man.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:37.260]   Every man has a right to equality of opportunity in education and things like that.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.540]   Certainly there should be no argument about these things.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:45.620]   A man who doesn't believe in equality of opportunity is unworthy of the name of man.
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.260]   I'm not saying all men are equal.
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.820]   I am saying that everyone should have an equal opportunity.
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:57.820]   But you see, the tendency when you look at things in that way is to forget the most important
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.180]   thing of all.
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:11.140]   Is a man just a creature who is to be well housed, well fed, health catered for, and
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.260]   given a certain amount of intellectual interest?
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.260]   Is that all?
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.700]   Surely the first question you ought to ask is this.
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.160]   What is man?
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.260]   What is a man?
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.220]   What is this man who is to be housed properly?
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.180]   What is this man whose mind is to be cultivated?
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.300]   What is mind?
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.660]   What is man?
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:37.500]   Now then, here is the only word that really deals with such matters.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.060]   That is why the gospel calls upon us to listen to it.
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:45.300]   That is why these men went out and preached it in the ancient world and called upon everybody
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.180]   to listen to what they've got to say.
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:52.460]   It deals with this great question of man himself and my life in this world.
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.580]   What is life?
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.220]   What is the world?
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.860]   What's the object of living?
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.900]   These are the questions raised by this message.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:11.220]   And then this great question as to how one is to live, and above and beyond it all, what's
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.580]   the meaning of death?
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.860]   How can a man die?
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.380]   How should a man die?
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.580]   Is there anything beyond it?
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.700]   And then the whole question of the future of the world.
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:27.540]   I know the next five years are very important, but my dear friend, they'll soon be gone,
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.420]   and some of us, many of us perhaps will have gone before they're over.
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.420]   We don't know.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:38.020]   But then there lies that great question, eternity.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.500]   These are the questions that are dealt with here.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.580]   This is the subject matter of this particular message.
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:50.460]   In other words, and this is the tragedy of this modern age, that men feel that this is
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.260]   irrelevant.
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.500]   But my dear friend, this alone is relevant.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.460]   Let me put it to you very simply and very plainly like this.
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:06.500]   How have you stood up to the whole question of life and of living?
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.460]   There are trials that come to us all.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.860]   There are troubles.
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.500]   There are problems.
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.340]   There are heartaches.
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.300]   Are you perfectly happy?
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.780]   Are you quite content?
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.540]   Are you perfectly satisfied with your record?
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.780]   Can you look with equanimity at your own death and what lies beyond it?
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.300]   These are the great questions.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.460]   You see, this is a very practical message, this.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.260]   This is concerned about us.
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.260]   Are you happy?
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:38.300]   Oh, there's great unhappiness in the world.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:45.880]   The poet speaks about the still, sad music of humanity and how true it is.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.420]   Think of the unhappiness in the world at this very moment.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.760]   Don't take one side only.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.660]   Don't take one picture.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.900]   Look at the problems.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.900]   Only this morning I had a question put to me.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.940]   Is it wrong to commit suicide?
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.300]   There are many people contemplating suicide.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.020]   There are people in agony of mind and of heart and of soul tonight, by the thousand, not
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.020]   to say more.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:14.860]   And there are others who are conscious of failure, conscious of misery and unhappiness,
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.340]   wondering whether life is worth living at all.
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.700]   Can they ever extricate themselves out of some position?
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:27.580]   Must they always fail to stand and must they always fall to the same temptation?
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.380]   This moral problem, the running sore of the soul, call it what you will, these are the
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.380]   problems.
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.100]   These are the things that make life, life.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:41.180]   Put a man in a palace, he may be yet miserable.
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:46.780]   Now then, these are the questions which are dealt with by this gospel, by this message.
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.380]   You see, our Lord summed it all up when he put it like this.
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:56.140]   We are told of him that he saw mankind as sheep without a shepherd.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:05.700]   He saw them as strange sheep at the mercy of all the stray dogs and marauders and all
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.900]   were there to attack us and to make life miserable and unhappy.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:18.300]   That's the kind of picture that we are given here constantly by our blessed Lord himself.
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:23.220]   He just saw people like that and in that condition.
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:30.780]   And so he says in a pregnant verse that sums it all up, "The Son of Man is come to seek
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:37.380]   and to save that which is lost."
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:42.340]   Now then, there is our first great reason then for calling upon men and women to listen
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.340]   to this gospel.
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.020]   That's our justification for this meeting tonight.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:50.100]   We claim that we are doing the most important, the most vital, the most urgent thing in the
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.100]   world.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:59.300]   We are really here to deal with the problems, the problems of life.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:04.020]   The great questions that determine whether we are miserable or happy, whether we are
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.140]   at peace or whether we are restless.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:12.340]   The whole object is to bring us to see how to live, to know what life is, and to live
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.060]   it in a glorious and in a triumphant manner.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.980]   That's the first reason.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.580]   But let me go on to a second reason that's suggested to us at once.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:26.580]   The second reason is this, that this message is something concerning something that has
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:34.540]   happened, the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:39.940]   And so he proceeds at once to the history.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:45.940]   Now I put that in the form of a principle, which again I want to show you is a most important
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.700]   one just at this present time.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.580]   This word "beginning," this is something that is absolutely vital.
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:58.140]   The gospel is a message concerning something that has happened.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.380]   And I say that that in and of itself makes it imperative that we should listen to it.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.180]   Now let me put it in this form.
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.740]   Let me contrast it with so many other messages that are being held before men tonight.
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:14.860]   Take all these theories and ideas that I've been talking about, all these points of view,
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.900]   all these various interests in life.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:22.200]   Now, all right, I'm prepared to agree that they all have their interests, and if you
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.740]   are interested, take them up and give your time and your attention to them.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:32.500]   But you know, this is something very different for this one reason, that it is a record of
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:37.660]   something that has happened, something that has taken place.
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:42.420]   You may be an intellectualist, and you may say, "Well, I'm very fond of reading people's
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.700]   views and theories and ideas about life.
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.940]   I read, therefore, not only the great philosophers, but I read about Confucius, and I read of
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:50.940]   Buddhism.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.460]   I read all these various other religions, and I'm tremendously interested in their
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.300]   theories and in their points of view."
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.300]   All right.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.940]   All right, I understand that.
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.860]   I'm not saying a word against it.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:08.740]   All I'm trying to show you is that the Gospel doesn't belong to those categories.
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.580]   It isn't one of the great religions of the world.
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.580]   It isn't a religion.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.140]   Well, what is it?
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:21.100]   Well, it is, I say, something which is historical.
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.860]   Confucius doesn't tell you about something that's happened.
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:27.620]   He just tells you what he thinks, what you ought to do and how you ought to do it.
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.820]   So does Buddha.
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.580]   So does Hinduism.
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.080]   So do all these various other religions.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.420]   So do all your philosophers.
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:46.740]   But here we are face to face with something that puts this message in an entirely different
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:47.740]   category.
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.740]   What is that?
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.820]   Well, I say, here you have primarily a report of something that has happened, of some events
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.920]   that have taken place in history.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.180]   So that, you see, you're not looking at theories any longer.
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:04.460]   You are asked to consider a fact, an announcement, a proclamation of something that has taken
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.460]   place.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:11.420]   Let me use a simple illustration to show you the difference.
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:17.660]   Mankind before the Second World War, as indeed before the First World War, was spending its
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.300]   time with its various interests.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.540]   People were discussing the points of view and the philosophy.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.020]   Politics was very prominent in this country of ours here.
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.900]   And people were giving themselves to pleasure and to enjoyment.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.660]   And they intended going on doing that the rest of their time in this world.
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:40.340]   But then suddenly an announcement was made.
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.740]   And what was the announcement?
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:48.300]   Well, that the Archduke Ferdinand had been murdered at Sarajevo.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.300]   Here's a proclamation.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:54.700]   Of course, people saw the news and many foolishly said, "Oh, that's all right.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.700]   These Balkans, they do that sort of thing.
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.700]   Carry on.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.700]   Let the dance continue.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.340]   Let us go on with our interest."
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.780]   But an announcement has been made.
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.580]   And you see, the world has never been the same since.
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.420]   Much more important than the theories and the ideas and the intellectual interests and
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:17.460]   all the fun and the enjoyment is a fact.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.700]   What makes a difference to life is not simply the theories and ideas that are propagated
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:26.620]   by men, but the things that take place.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:32.060]   The murder of a man which leads to a world war and your whole world has been changed.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.180]   It'll never be the same again.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.180]   And so on.
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.420]   With various other events like this that have come into history and have changed the whole
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.020]   course, we should pay great attention to things that happen.
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:47.340]   Well, now then, the Gospel goes into that category.
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.820]   It is not merely a teaching.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:55.380]   It is first and foremost a proclamation and an announcement of something that has taken
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.380]   place.
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.380]   Indeed, I can put it like this.
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.420]   Why should you listen to this?
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:07.420]   "Well, you must listen to this," says the New Testament, "because it affects your life
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.200]   at the profoundest points of all."
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.460]   It goes further and it tells you this.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:21.180]   Even though you pay no attention to it, it's going to affect you.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:25.740]   You can say, like many men say, about acts of Parliament that are passed, they say, "I'm
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:26.740]   not interested."
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:31.300]   That won't help them at all if they've broken that law and are arrested and find themselves
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.540]   in a court.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.100]   The act has been passed.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.180]   It affects them.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.420]   Whether you like it or not doesn't make the slightest difference.
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.980]   Now, the Gospel says that about itself.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.500]   So that we're not confronted here by a particular teaching or a point of view.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.900]   We are told here that something has happened in history that affects us, every one of us,
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.100]   whether we like it or whether we don't.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.220]   We can't escape it.
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.580]   We can't evade it.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.900]   It goes even further.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:05.700]   It tells us that we should listen to it and pay great attention to what it's got to tell
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:11.180]   us because we shall have to face it again.
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:15.740]   That even though we go through this world without paying any attention to it at all,
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.140]   we haven't finished with it.
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:22.980]   Now, this is what makes this thing so tremendous and so serious.
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:30.980]   It actually tells us that we can never be the same again because of this Gospel.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:38.100]   Listen to our Lord himself saying this, "If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.100]   him not.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:44.380]   For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:51.660]   He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judges him.
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:28:02.740]   The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:12.100]   You see, that means this, that this word has been uttered, this message has been delivered.
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:18.500]   And so, when we find ourselves beyond this life at the bar of judgment, we shall have
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.640]   to confront this word that has been spoken.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:28.420]   We shall be told the proclamation was made, the statement was announced.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.580]   You say, "But I didn't hear it, I wasn't interested in it."
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:34.920]   Well, very well, you will be told you should have listened to it, you should be listening.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.420]   It was such an important proclamation.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.620]   Here it is, "This has happened, you are left without any excuse whatsoever."
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.220]   Our Lord makes that abundantly clear, doesn't he?
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:49.980]   He doesn't judge, he says, "The word that I have spoken, it shall judge you in the last
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:50.980]   day."
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.620]   Something has taken place, something has happened.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:59.380]   A cure has been procured, a cure has been announced, and you die of the disease, and
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.660]   you needn't have died.
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:05.140]   It was there, it was for you.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.900]   Very well, I say, here is something that is vitally important.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.460]   Our Lord puts it again in these words.
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:16.300]   He said, "If I had not come and spoken unto you, they had not had sin, but now they have
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.560]   no cloak for their sin."
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:25.460]   We are dealing here, not with the realm of things speculative or philosophical or mere
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.460]   teachings.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.600]   Oh, thank God for this.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:33.300]   The thing that puts this Gospel into a category all on its own is that it is an announcement
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:38.060]   of something that has happened, that has taken place, a great event which has altered the
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:42.900]   whole course of history and made everything different, and every man now must consider
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.460]   himself in the light of this event.
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.380]   That is the proclamation.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:54.900]   Very well, that brings me to my third point, which is this one.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:30:02.780]   The Gospel should be listened to, and we should pay great heed and attention to it, because
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:09.100]   of this very something that has happened, because of the nature of what has happened.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.580]   What is it that has happened?
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:15.740]   Well, listen, Mark bursts upon us immediately, "The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:16.740]   the Son of God."
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:22.500]   Now then, here is the uniqueness of the Gospel.
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:29.420]   And this is really why these men are literally thrilling and pulsating with a divine kind
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.840]   of enthusiasm.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.420]   This is the thing that makes the Apostle say that he is not ashamed of it.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:40.100]   This is the thing that made these early Christians ready to die as martyrs for the sake of this
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.100]   Gospel.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.620]   They didn't care that they were persecuted and scattered from Jerusalem.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.540]   Everywhere they went and preached this word.
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.540]   What is it?
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:52.420]   Well, it's this amazing announcement of what has taken place.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:58.340]   The Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.340]   What does it mean?
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:05.780]   Well, now, let me invite you to do something when you go home tonight.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:12.160]   Read the introductions to these various Gospels, and you'll be struck at once by something
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.700]   that is so obvious on the very surface.
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.140]   There's the same note there.
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.140]   What is this note?
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.140]   Well, it's the note of wonder.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.180]   It's the note of marvel.
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.860]   It's the note of amazement.
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:29.540]   Now, Mark is in many ways the most practical of them all, and he doesn't give us all
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:34.740]   the details that we have about the real beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:40.140]   You get that much better in Matthew, and in Mark, and in John.
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:44.500]   Mark's this practical man, as it were, the man who just wants to give you the bare outline,
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.500]   the skeleton.
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.300]   The others give us the details.
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:48.300]   And what are these details?
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.060]   Well, you see, they're things like this.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:55.940]   Some of the most astonishing and amazing things that the world has ever known.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.580]   It's an atmosphere of marvel.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.220]   It's an atmosphere of miracle.
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:04.900]   The old world that we are living in, it's an old, old world, and it had been going on
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:10.980]   so long, and the Jews in particular, they'd got a real routine, a ritual, and the priests
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.300]   had got it in connection with the temple.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:19.220]   They divided up their duties in the temple into various times, and different people went
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:25.660]   at different times, and we are told here, in this amazing way in the Gospel according
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:32.820]   to St. Luke, that a man of the name of Zacharias, who was one of these priests, it came to pass,
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:38.420]   he was there, he was, he and his wife Elizabeth, they had no child, and it came to pass that
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:44.860]   while he executed the priest's office before God, in the order of his course, he'd gone
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.860]   in many times before and had done his duty, and he'd gone out again, and somebody else
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.860]   had relieved him and had gone in.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:54.820]   They'd organized this thing very well, as labor's organized today.
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:59.460]   You clocked in and you clocked out, and on they went, they just did their duty according
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:03.380]   to his course, according to the custom of the priest's office.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:08.020]   His lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:12.540]   And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.100]   And this had happened many, many times before.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.900]   It was just routine, just a part of the routine worship.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:23.220]   Zacharias had gone in not expecting anything to happen, and nobody else was expecting anything
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.220]   else to happen.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:29.180]   But listen, "There appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.860]   the altar of incense.
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:37.220]   When Zacharias saw him, he was troubled and fear fell upon him, and the angel began to
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.220]   speak to him."
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:43.500]   Now, that's the sort of way in which the Gospel begins.
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.260]   Suddenly there's an intervention.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.180]   Suddenly there is an angelic appearance.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.180]   It's not the only one.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:54.980]   Listen, here's another one for you.
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:34:01.380]   You read in the 26th verse in the sixth month, "The angel Gabriel was sent from God into
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:08.980]   a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin, espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:14.100]   the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary."
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.100]   Quite natural.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.180]   Young men, young women fall in love with one another.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.180]   They become engaged.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:21.220]   They're hoping to get married.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.300]   Nothing unusual.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.260]   Quite the usual, normal, I say, almost routine again.
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.060]   But you see, now, now, something's happening.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.220]   The angel came in unto her and said, "Hail thou that art highly favoured.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.020]   The Lord is with thee.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.420]   Blessed are thou among women."
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.340]   And an announcement is made to her.
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.340]   Amazing and astonishing.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.340]   She stumbles at it.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.500]   She doesn't understand it.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.660]   She's in trouble about the whole thing.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:50.660]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.500]   The announcement is made.
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:58.260]   And then Mary herself, you see, bursts forth into song when she comes to visit her cousin
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.260]   Elizabeth.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.820]   "It came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.620]   her womb, Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:10.420]   And she spake out with a loud voice and said, 'Blessed art thou among women, and blessed
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.100]   is the fruit of thy womb.'
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:19.660]   And Mary burst forth into her song, 'My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit doth
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.500]   rejoice in God my Saviour.'"
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:30.900]   And on you go with her great song of praise and of thanksgiving and of worship unto God.
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:37.220]   Then old Zacharias, who had been struck dumb, he does exactly the same thing.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:42.020]   His father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied, saying, "Blessed be
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:46.740]   the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visited and redeemed his people."
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.620]   He bursts forth into song.
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:49.620]   What's this?
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:53.300]   Well, it's the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.540]   You see, this is not just men getting a good idea.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:00.160]   This is not a new political program or an idea of social reform.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.580]   It's not just some new insight into philosophic truth.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.580]   No, no.
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.580]   Angels come down.
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:08.660]   God hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:14.060]   And you get exactly the same thing you remember later in connection with the birth of our
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.060]   Lord.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:21.740]   Let me remind you of this old story, how wonderfully it brings out this point.
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:25.460]   And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.260]   flock by night.
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.580]   There's no more ordinary task than that.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:35.240]   Shepherds were very lowly people at that time in Israel.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:39.540]   It was one of the lowest forms of occupation to be a shepherd.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.520]   There were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.520]   at night.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:50.720]   And there they were at night and doing this half asleep, half awake, drudgery in the extreme,
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.840]   nothing expected, nothing happening.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:57.000]   But listen, "And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.440]   shone round about them.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.440]   And they were sore afraid.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.560]   And the angel said, 'Fear not, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which will be to
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.560]   all people.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:13.640]   For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.'
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:18.400]   And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:24.760]   'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men.'"
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.440]   My friends, this is what's happened.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.960]   This is why I'm standing in this pulpit.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.400]   I'm not here to expand the theories of philosophers.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.360]   I'm not here to put my own ideas to you.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.360]   I'm here to tell you that this has happened.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   This is history.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.520]   This has taken place.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.080]   What is this?
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:46.200]   Well, this is the unique event of all time.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.880]   Old Zacharias has expressed it.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:54.400]   "God hath visited and redeemed his people."
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.400]   What is this?
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:38:04.360]   Well, as John the Baptist and our Lord himself in their preaching put it, the time is fulfilled.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.360]   What's happened?
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.360]   Oh, this is what has happened.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:15.360]   "When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.480]   under the law, to redeem them that are under the law."
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.960]   The beginning of the gospel of Jesus.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.960]   Here's a man.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.720]   Here's a babe born in Bethlehem.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.320]   The announcement made to the shepherds was concerning him.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.400]   They went to Bethlehem and they saw him lying in the manger, even as they'd been told he
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.400]   would be found.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.040]   And they went back rejoicing.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.040]   Why?
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.480]   Just because a babe's born?
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.320]   Because a babe's born in a stable?
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.320]   Because a babe's lying in a manger?
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   No, no.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.320]   Because of who he is?
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:45.760]   Jesus, yes, but he's Christ.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.440]   Son of God.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.600]   Listen to the author of the epistle to the Hebrews putting it.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:58.560]   "God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:07.760]   prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us in his Son, whom he hath also appointed
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.760]   heir of all things, who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:16.800]   person, and upholding all things by the word of his power."
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.880]   That's it.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:23.880]   That's why you and I should listen to this, my dear friends.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:28.720]   We are listening here to the unique event of all events in the whole history of the
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.440]   world and of the universe.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:37.600]   We are asked to listen to the beginning of something that devolves time into two, something
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:46.320]   that is catastrophic in the whole history of the human race.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:55.680]   We are concerned about the message of one and concerning one who was able to say something
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.080]   like this.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:07.600]   "We speak that we do know and testify that which we have seen."
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.800]   You see, he said that to a great teacher, a man called Nicodemus, a man who knew his
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.880]   scriptures and was an excellent expositor of the scriptures.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.720]   He said that to a human teacher.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.800]   But that is what he says to him.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.360]   He says, "I'm not giving you a theory out of books.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.360]   I'm not here to tell you what other men have taught.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.600]   I'm not here as an expositor.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:36.900]   We speak that which we do know and testify that which we have seen.
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:41.760]   This is none other than the Son of God.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:47.280]   And this is why this is the most urgent and the most relevant and the most important message
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.760]   that mankind can listen to this evening.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:54.440]   This is the thing that sent these others trailing out along that ancient world, that God had
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.400]   entered into time, that God had sent his own Son.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.760]   We are no longer listening to men.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:07.520]   We are listening to God, God in the flesh, God incarnate.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:13.080]   My dear friend, don't you see how important and vital this is?
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.800]   We have listened to men.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.600]   Mankind has been listening to men throughout the running centuries.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:22.680]   I'm not here to disparage the abilities and the efforts and the endeavors of men.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.880]   All honor to them.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.880]   But what have they done?
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.000]   Where have they taken us?
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   What have they discovered?
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.240]   What do they know?
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.760]   Is the world becoming increasingly happy?
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.560]   We find it increasingly easy to live and to be moral and straight and pure and good
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.560]   and true.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:41.600]   Have they solved the problem of death in the grave and what lies beyond?
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.840]   The answer is they haven't.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:48.080]   We know they haven't.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.360]   There is no need to disparage them.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.160]   But all I am saying is this.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:01.520]   Isn't it the essence of wisdom to listen to one who speaks with a unique authority?
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.840]   Because he is not only men.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.840]   He is men.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.840]   He is truly men.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.000]   He is Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.760]   He worked as a carpenter.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   He is a man.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.720]   But he is not only men.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.760]   He is Son of God.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.680]   Have you started listening to him, my friend, in your troubles and your problems?
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.880]   When you're dealing with this whole question of what is men, what am I?
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.880]   What's life?
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.880]   What's the meaning?
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.880]   What's the object?
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.880]   How can I live in a decent, clean manner?
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.480]   How can I die without being afraid?
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.760]   How can I look with equanimity at that unknown future?
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.760]   Listen to this one.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.880]   Here is one who has come out of eternity into time.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.880]   Here is one who has lived as a man amongst men, tempted in all points like as we are
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.680]   yet without sin.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.720]   Here is one against whom the devil brought out all his reserves and trained all his batteries
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.240]   upon him, and yet he vanquished him.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.240]   He smote him.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.720]   He conquered him.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:03.320]   Here is one who has met every temptation that you can ever meet, but he never fell to a
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.880]   single one, and he asks you to listen to him.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.680]   He's got a message for you.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.380]   He says he's come to help you.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.360]   He says he's come to deliver you.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.000]   That's why you should listen.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   I agree with you.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.280]   We are getting tired of theories, aren't we?
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.780]   We are getting tired of promises.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.560]   It's a very dangerous thing, this.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.920]   There is a sort of apathy in this country today about the general election because the
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.120]   average man says, "Well, we know.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.040]   We've heard it all before," and so they stop listening.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.800]   In a sense, I understand it, though it's wrong.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:39.640]   It's our business to get the best government we can, but all I'm saying is this, that we
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:43.360]   know that no man can satisfy our real problems.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.360]   No man can solve them.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.840]   Civilization is a failure.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.840]   Civilizations come and go.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.680]   They go round in circles.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:44:00.160]   All the wisdom of the sages of all the ages has not been able to deal with and to solve
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:06.000]   our real problems, not to satisfy our deepest and our most fundamental needs.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   None of them.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.160]   Man at his best, at his tip-toe, all honor to the great men of the world.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.160]   They cannot get there.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:18.960]   The world, by wisdom, knew not God.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:26.080]   So God has sent his only son into the world.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:32.120]   And the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.440]   thing preached, to save them that believe.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.720]   What is this thing preached?
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:41.240]   It's the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:46.600]   Here is the thing, I say, that puts it into a category quite apart this evening, that
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:53.000]   it is God speaking in the person of his only son, addressing us directly.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.120]   God has come down in the person of his Son to solve the problem of humanity.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.080]   That's the message.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:06.340]   So I would say just a brief final word to you, my fourth principle.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:12.760]   We should listen to it because of the consequences of this thing which has happened.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:13.760]   What are the consequences?
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.160]   They are all summed up in the word "gospel."
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.640]   Good news.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:24.120]   Isn't this the tragedy of the world tonight, that it doesn't know this good news?
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:28.200]   Look at the blasé way in which people dismiss the gospel.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.880]   Oh, what a tragedy!
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.480]   And all this has happened, which I'm telling you.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:38.320]   These people who are so ready to be thrilled by anything or nothing, who can work up a
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:46.480]   great excitement and get into an ecstasy about mere trivialities, regard with disdain and
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:55.360]   complete indifference this amazing fact that God has visited and redeemed his people.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.720]   This is the good news.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.720]   What is it?
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.160]   Well, let me put it to you in the great verse of Charles Wesley, "Hark!
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:09.120]   The herald angels sing, 'Glory to the new-born King, peace on earth and mercy mild, God
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:14.000]   and sinners reconciled.'"
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.680]   That's the good news.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.680]   What does it mean?
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:25.680]   Well, again I remind you that our Lord himself put it in these words, "The Son of Man is
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.680]   come to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.200]   Do you know what the good news is?
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.120]   It's just this.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:37.520]   I hope to elaborate it on subsequent Sunday evenings.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.360]   This is the beginning of the gospel of Christ.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.240]   This is how this good news came.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.480]   This is how it burst upon the world when it wasn't expecting it.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.920]   What did it say?
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:52.000]   Well, this is what it tells us.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.240]   All our troubles, all of them—I'm not hesitating to use the word, there is nothing which can
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:06.280]   be excluded—all our troubles are due to our sin and due to the fact that we are estranged
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.400]   from God.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.680]   Why do we need governments at all?
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:13.920]   Why do we need kings?
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.100]   Why do we need governors?
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.100]   Why do we need magistrates?
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:20.160]   Why do we need those to enforce law and order?
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.800]   Why has all this become necessary?
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   There's only one answer.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:27.640]   It is because of sin.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:31.560]   All our problems are the result of sin.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:35.680]   There would have been no problems if men hadn't sinned.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:40.960]   So you see, the Bible says—this is the fundamental formula—that all mankind has sinned against
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.840]   God, is in the wrong relationship to God.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:48.320]   Indeed, it goes further.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:52.880]   Because the world has sinned against God, it is under the wrath of God.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.520]   There must be no mistake about that.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:02.640]   God hates sin, and God doesn't bless willful, rebellious, arrogant sinners.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   No, no.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.440]   He does the opposite.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:10.360]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness and ungodliness of men
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.680]   that hold down the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:18.280]   You see, the world is as it is because it's not receiving the blessing of God.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.560]   Indeed, the displeasure of God is upon it.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.320]   And this is what we are witnessing.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:27.600]   All these things that happen, these two great world wars, are nothing but a manifestation
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.920]   of the wrath of God upon sin.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.680]   You see, it works like this.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.360]   Man by sinning has brought disorder into the world.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:39.480]   He brought in jealousy and envy and strife and hatred and bitterness and lust and passion.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.720]   All these things came in when man fell.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:42.720]   He wasn't made like that.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.680]   They've come in because he's fallen.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:45.680]   And here it is.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:50.080]   Now God has introduced government and order to keep these things within bounds.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:54.720]   But when mankind gets up and says, "We can order it ourselves, and we don't need you
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.160]   by means of democracy and counting heads.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:02.640]   We can get perfect government and reintroduce by legislation a condition of paradise,"
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.880]   God says, "Very well.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:10.600]   I will withhold my restraints and see what happens."
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:14.600]   And what has happened has been two world wars.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:20.920]   That arrogant criticism of the Bible and disbelief in God began in Germany.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.080]   Don't forget that.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.280]   In the 1830s.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:27.920]   And she has been the main cause of trouble ever since in the two world wars and in other
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.400]   respects.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:34.560]   This is one of the consequences, and all the nations of the world are involved in this.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:40.720]   God has withdrawn his restraints that arrogant men may reap the consequences of his own blasphemy
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:44.920]   and his own falling.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.640]   And that is what the world deserves.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:52.840]   It deserves nothing but the misery that it brings upon itself.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:57.480]   If a man won't take good advice, if a man rejects a gracious offer and lends himself
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:01.960]   in trouble, who has he got to blame but himself?
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:06.520]   He has made his own bed, you say, let him lie in it.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.120]   And that is what mankind deserves.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:13.960]   But my dear friend, it is my privilege to tell you tonight about the beginning of the
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.080]   gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.080]   What is it?
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.080]   It is this.
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:28.800]   That God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.640]   in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.880]   Good news, here it is.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:45.800]   God was in Christ, in and through Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:49.280]   their trespasses unto them.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:55.520]   Here is the good news, that though we all are fools, though we all are suffering and
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:01.240]   reaping the consequences of our own rebellion and sin against God, that which we have inherited,
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:05.720]   that which we are guilty of ourselves, though we deserve nothing but increasing and continued
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:15.760]   misery and hell beyond it to all eternity, God so loved the world that he sent his only
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:21.480]   begotten Son into it, Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:26.960]   He came, was born of the womb of that Virgin Mary to whom the archangel made the announcement.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.960]   John the Baptist sent before him, and all Zacharias is proud that his little son has
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:39.520]   the great privilege of being the forerunner of such a glorious Messiah and deliverer.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:44.520]   It is not surprising that they are all thrilled, that they all sing, that the angels sing,
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:49.040]   the shepherds go back to their sheep rejoicing, these men go out and preach and are ready
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.880]   to die for this message.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:51.880]   What is it?
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:52:00.120]   Oh, that God in his infinite everlasting love, in spite of what we are and what we deserve,
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:07.840]   has made a way whereby he can forgive us and reconcile us unto himself and restore us to
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:16.440]   his favor, give us a new start, give us a new life, give us a new outlook, give us a
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:25.160]   new power, give us a new understanding, give us something of his own divine eternal character,
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:35.800]   and offer us the wisdom, the promise of spending eternity everlastingly in his holy and in
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:38.360]   his glorious presence.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:44.760]   Good news, my dear friend, that it is possible for you and for me to overcome sin and temptation.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:51.120]   It's possible for us to have victory where we've always known defeat.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:56.980]   It is possible for us to enjoy the blessings of God and to live life in a worthy manner.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:01.960]   It's possible for us to understand ourselves and life and God's great purpose and the
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.080]   world and its future.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:09.200]   If any man be in Christ, all things have passed away, all things have become new.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.840]   He's a new creation.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.760]   That's why it's such a privilege to preach this gospel.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:23.680]   And remember, it's a gospel for all, for any, whosoever believeth in him.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:30.120]   Your psychotherapy, your psychological mechanisms, your drugs, your political programs, your
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:35.240]   sociological schemes, they all rely upon your ability.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:39.280]   They all need time, they all need application, they all need energy.
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.460]   They say, "Here it is for you, this is all you've got to do."
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.080]   But the trouble with us is we can't do it.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:50.320]   We lack the willpower, we've lost the stamina, there's something crippling us.
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:51.920]   We can't.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:55.320]   Thank God.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:59.320]   The apostle Paul was able to say about this message, "I am not ashamed of the gospel
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:06.600]   of Christ, for it is the power of God, unto salvation to every one that believeth."
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:12.400]   Here is a gospel that can come to a man or a woman so steeped in sin that they've almost
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:18.920]   lost their human personality, and it can make new creatures of them.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:22.720]   His blood can make the foulest clean.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.000]   His blood availed for me.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.160]   There is something that tells you that whereas you and I and all mankind by nature are not
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:36.480]   only sinful and guilty, and are weak and powerless and helpless and hopeless and forlorn, that
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:43.400]   the power of God is engaged on our side and can lift us up and make new men and women
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:50.480]   of us, and give us a new life that will amaze us and astonish us as long as we are left
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.960]   in this world and to all eternity.
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:58.200]   It's a message that makes a man who sees it and knows what it is, join with all those
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:09.520]   at the beginning who sang and said, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.080]   goodwill toward men."
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:23.000]   That, my dear friend, is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   Are you amazed at it?
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   Do you rejoice in it?
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   Are you thrilled by it?
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.360]   You either are or you're not, and if you're not, you don't understand it, you don't see
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:33.280]   your need, you don't know the problem, you don't see what's happened.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:39.920]   I'm here to announce it to you and to tell you quite simply that you have but to believe
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:47.520]   this and to go to God and to thank him for it and to give yourself to him.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:54.440]   And you'll soon begin to sing, and you'll want everybody else to know about it, as Mark
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:59.280]   did, as Matthew did, as Luke did, as John did, as Paul did, as all the people scattered
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.280]   abroad did.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:08.640]   And wherever they went, they went and preached the word, the good news of God and sinners
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:17.040]   reconciled in Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.960]   Amen.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:29.440]   The closing hymn is hymn number 320, "O'er the gloomy hills of darkness, look, my soul,
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.840]   be still and gaze.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:36.160]   All the promises do travel with a glorious day of grace."
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:41.160]   Here's the future outlook for all who believe this message, 320.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:57:01.160]   [MUSIC - "O'ER THE GLOOMY HILLS OF DARKNESS, LOOK, MY SOUL, BE STILL AND GAZE"]
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:29.160]   [MUSIC - "O'ER THE GLOOMY HILLS OF DARKNESS, LOOK, MY SOUL, BE STILL AND GAZE"]
