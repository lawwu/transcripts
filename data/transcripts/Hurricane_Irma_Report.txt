[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.440]   Thank you to so many of you who have sent your inquiries inquiring after our health
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.560]   and safety and status following the path of Hurricane Irma through the state of Florida
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.920]   in the past few days.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.920]   Thank you for your care and for your concern.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.880]   This audio file will be a relatively brief after action report for you sharing our status
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.400]   and welfare and just a little bit of our experience and just my thoughts of what I learned from
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.680]   the storm.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.720]   The next episode which hopefully will be released concurrently will be back to regularly scheduled
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.280]   personal finance programming.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.400]   I'm not entirely certain as to the release schedule of these episodes as we're currently
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.280]   experiencing significant problems with the internet connection, both my primary lines
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.720]   and also my backup plans.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.620]   Neither of them is working well.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.840]   So we're going to go to the plan three in order to release the episode.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.960]   But hopefully this will get out on the same day that I'm recording it which is Tuesday,
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.600]   September 12, 2017.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.440]   Unique thing about the internet issues is they all came out after the storm.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.040]   I didn't have any problems with the internet connection during the storm but here in afterward
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.680]   having internet issues and when you run a business like mine, it's a significant impedance
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.540]   to your work.
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.120]   The short version of this report is we are well.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.120]   I am well.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.400]   My entire family is well.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.240]   We have experienced minimal problems as a result of Hurricane Irma.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.240]   Personally we experienced no damage to property.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.440]   None of our personal property was affected although the property – my landlord's
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.760]   property was affected.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.680]   I had some tree limbs blow down, blew some fences down.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.560]   So that's a frustration but nothing significant.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.840]   Health-wise we are all well.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.440]   The major cost of Hurricane Irma for us personally has been the frustration of essentially a
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.560]   lost week of work.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.720]   In total thus far about eight days of lost productivity for me personally which is frustrating
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.340]   but in the grand scheme of things, obviously I have nothing to be ungrateful for and much
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.760]   to be very grateful for.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.600]   Not all of that lost work week was due specifically to hurricane activities although a good bit
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   of it was.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.040]   Whenever a hurricane comes to town, there are a number of things that need to be done
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.520]   in preparation for the storm.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.280]   The most obvious one is the personal acquisition of necessary supplies.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.200]   That's where the stores are filled with long lines of people lined up for water, for
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.320]   food that is not going to be spoiled if you lose power, flashlights, et cetera, things
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.840]   like that.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.600]   That process can take a good amount of time, extra time because the lines in stores perhaps
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.480]   lines in gas stations, et cetera.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.880]   But realistically speaking, it should only cost perhaps a few hours of time.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.560]   The significant cost of time in preparing for a hurricane is the cost of preparing your
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.560]   property.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.840]   So, that includes the obvious things like putting up storm shutters or putting up plywood
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.120]   over your windows to protect your windows from the hurricane winds.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.840]   Incidentally, it's specifically the reason you do that is to protect from anything that
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.800]   might be blowing in the wind.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.720]   Hurricanes will pick up all kinds of stuff and throw them at your window and knock right
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.080]   through.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.480]   And then there's also the time spent of preparing your property, bringing all your furniture,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.360]   whatever you can't bring inside, you strap down, you go around and pick up any debris
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.720]   in your yard and try to get all that stuff in the garbage and thrown away from your property
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.200]   as quickly as possible.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.280]   So, that's very time-consuming.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.120]   And then also the time-consuming aspect is just keeping an eye on it and figuring out
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.640]   what the right thing to do is.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.640]   Should you leave?
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.640]   Should you stay?
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.640]   If you're going to leave, where are you going to go?
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.360]   What direction, et cetera, and then preparing for that event.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.160]   And of course, my wife and I, we have three children under four years old and two dogs.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.100]   So, we're not as nimble as I once was when I was moving just by myself and I could come
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.080]   and go without any restrictions.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.520]   And in fact, just my family responsibilities were for me the biggest cost of the last week.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.560]   And that's what resulted in so much lost productivity for me personally.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.720]   My wife and our youngest child, our baby, both became pretty sick.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.640]   My wife very sick for a couple of days.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.520]   She really wasn't able to do much of anything, stayed in bed most of the time, et cetera.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.160]   So that meant that I was functionally a single father with three children under four trying
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.480]   to do hurricane preparations as well.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.000]   I thought I had a respect for the challenge that single fathers and mothers face in the
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.360]   past, but my respect has been refreshed.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.760]   I have a new level of respect for how challenging it is to get anything done when you are caring
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.160]   for several little children.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.840]   Little children are wonderful creatures, but productivity is not something that they're
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.740]   generally helpers with.
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.800]   You wind up doing most of your work twice over because they undo your work unintentionally
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.760]   and of course sometimes sweet and sometimes obnoxious ways.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.080]   But they just – even in the best of times, they slow everything down.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.800]   Maneuvering with three small children through the store.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.120]   I shared on the previous episode about going to Costco.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.400]   I was in the lines with three small children and everything just gets slowed down.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.720]   Everything becomes more challenging when you are maneuvering with several people.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.600]   I simply wasn't able to get anything done except constant work with caring for my children,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.440]   caring for my wife, making sure that she was cared for and then bringing in around the
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.680]   edges the necessary hurricane preparations.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.800]   That was very time-consuming.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.680]   So that just sucked up quite a bit of time.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.720]   Certainly I had big plans for the last week in terms of what I wanted to get accomplished
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.840]   and I was disappointed to not get those things done.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.660]   Put me behind on all of my schedule, but I have – I should probably not even bother
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.880]   to say anything about that compared to the challenges that so many people face with destruction
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.280]   to property and small destruction of life.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.760]   Thankfully, the impact of Hurricane Irma seems to be significantly less than what was expected.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.120]   Hurricanes can be unpredictable in that light.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.400]   Several of you have asked since I led the last show, "Should I stay or should I go?"
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.040]   If we chose to evacuate and if I chose to follow my own advice about evacuate the trouble
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.360]   zone and do it early.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.480]   In this case, I hope it's not hypocritical to report that we did not.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.120]   The big factor was simply my wife's health and then the health of our baby.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.320]   It's not that nothing was life-threatening, just simply that functionally it was a hard
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:39.480]   thing to imagine putting her into the car for multiple hours on a multiple trip if it
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.960]   could be avoided.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.160]   In terms of the evacuation plan with – Hurricane Irma was unique.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.960]   Many times with hurricanes, they come in from the coast, the west coast or the east coast
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.800]   and they'll cut across the Florida Peninsula or they'll be moving in that kind of direction.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.120]   So it's relatively easy to get out of the path of a hurricane.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.280]   Fifty miles south, fifty miles north makes a big difference.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.480]   Even fifty miles west makes a big difference.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.400]   But with Irma, the forecast track made it challenging to figure out because the entirety
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.120]   of the Florida Peninsula was within the cone of probable approach for much of the days
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.360]   preceding it.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.120]   At one point for several days in a row, where we live was directly right in the center of
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.240]   the forecast track, in the center of the cone.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.560]   So in order to get out of that path and in order to get away from the other people, I
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.560]   couldn't see any solution, any evacuation route that would make sense other than to
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.200]   go significantly to the north.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.360]   By my calculations, North Carolina seemed to be about the closest place that would be
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.840]   reasonable where you wouldn't wind up essentially possibly running – probably running from
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   the storm.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.680]   I know a few people who first went to the north and then to the east a little bit and
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.560]   moved three times to try to get out of the forecast path of the hurricane.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.120]   So we had potential plans to go to North Carolina or Alabama or something like that.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.840]   But with my wife feeling so poorly, it wasn't something that I really wanted to do if it
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.560]   weren't necessary.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:19.080]   The risk for hurricanes is often minimal compared to the way that it's reported.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.520]   For those of you who are observing the national or international news media as your primary
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:30.240]   source of information regarding hurricanes, it's not that the reporting is inaccurate
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.720]   necessarily, but often it's overhyped and overblown.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.600]   My own experience with being a Florida native and hurricanes just simply being a fact of
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:48.840]   life is you do need to be careful with hurricanes, but there's no reason to freak out.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:56.160]   I saw a significant amount of probably over – just too much freak out with regard to
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.320]   Irma, especially with the people.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.880]   I didn't feel that – I don't have any complaints about the work of the emergency
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.440]   officials.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.840]   I think our local emergency management officials did a fine job.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.800]   Governor Scott, the governor of Florida did a fine job.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.200]   I have no complaints there.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.200]   But the way that things are reported is often very confusing.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.500]   For example, people talk a lot about evacuation zones and it's easy to get the impression
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:23.280]   if you consume national media that everybody who's within a cone of error needs to evacuate.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.040]   I think everyone here down in Florida was pretty much on edge as well after watching
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.960]   Hurricane Harvey for the last week.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:36.560]   Many people were jittery and not logically jittery but just emotionally wound up and
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.640]   emotionally jittery because of what they had observed.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:46.200]   There was a lot more fear rather than rationality guiding the day.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.520]   I'm not saying that the storm was not big.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:55.040]   It was historically large, historically powerful and powerful for a historic amount of time.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.960]   It was an impressive storm and certainly it needed to be and was taken very seriously.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.300]   I took it very seriously as we should take everything, every significant event that can
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.920]   cause damage to health and property.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.320]   We should take those things seriously.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.400]   It's an awesome – storms are awesome.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:20.000]   They're overpoweringly overwhelming and we are essentially impotent in the face of
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   them.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.400]   It's a reminder of our own humanity and essential smallness when compared to the power
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.320]   of the cosmos.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.960]   And yet just because a hurricane is headed your way doesn't necessarily mean that freak
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.960]   out is always warranted.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.760]   So if you're interested, a few thoughts on that, especially it would be helpful to many
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.640]   of you who are not from Florida.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.480]   The category of the storm makes a huge difference.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:49.360]   My understanding of the impact of a windstorm is that there is more of an exponential effect
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:55.720]   of the damage as the winds increase, not just a cumulative effect.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:01.720]   A category five storm is not 30% worse than a category three storm in terms of its potential
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   damage.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:09.600]   It is – it's much, much worse in terms of what those higher winds can actually do
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.880]   to structures and to property and to lives as well.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.800]   So on that account, Hurricane Irma was a very strong storm and needed to be paid careful
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.560]   attention to with regard to that.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:27.480]   But even so, as a category five hurricane, the major risks for hurricane damage from
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:32.460]   winds really only comes to people who are in poorly built structures.
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:37.720]   So there are a few people who have to pay very careful attention to wind loads and those
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.760]   things are number one if you live in a makeshift structure, live in a mobile home, live in
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:49.560]   an RV or live in a poorly built or old wooden house without any of the modern windstorm
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.920]   construction methods.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.600]   For example, strapping of roof trusses, proper – just things that are done to hold the
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.560]   house properly together.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.320]   Here in Florida, we – all of the trusses are fully strapped to the walls on new construction.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.880]   There's a – all of the codes as far as the number of nails that need to be held in
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.040]   an asphalt shingle are significantly higher than they are in other states.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.820]   And so if you live in a modern structure, you can be confident that the house is built
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.900]   for a higher wind load than an older structure.
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:26.680]   So when I looked at our own situation and tried to make that fresh decision of evacuation,
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.580]   the house that we live in is not necessarily the newest and the greatest but it's not
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.800]   a weak or poorly built structure.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.640]   And so the primary plan was just simply to change from where we are to another structure
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.620]   of a friend or family member that is newer, more modern, built out of concrete instead
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.420]   of out of wood, et cetera, meets all the current hurricane codes.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:53.000]   If you do that and you're not in a zone of concern with water, in general, you can
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.360]   ride out just about any hurricane.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:01.360]   At any point in time, you may have some tornado threat that comes in a hurricane.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.400]   But much of the major damage from hurricanes, it happens either in poorly built structures,
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.360]   rip a mobile home park apart for example, or from tornado damage on one side of the
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360]   hurricane.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.000]   A tornado damage is very hard to predict.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.880]   So the first layer of hurricane concern, of wind concern for me is always am I going to
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.400]   be in a structure that sound given the size and power of the storm?
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:32.000]   And I have a number of friends and family members who have new modern structures that
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.120]   are perfectly adequate to take shelter in.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:40.240]   And that was what we were planning to do as a primary course of action.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:48.080]   So my point is if you live in a modern house, not in an old or weak or inadequate structure
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.600]   like a mobile home for a hurricane, if you live in a modern house, hurricanes aren't
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:58.520]   quite so terrible as they're often reported on the national media.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.160]   Second thing reflecting wind concerns has to do with the width of the storm.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.360]   A hurricane when it talks about, when they talk about a category five storm or something
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:12.440]   like that, the actual impact of the hurricane winds, those highest of winds is severe.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:17.400]   But it's only the most severe in a relatively narrow swath close to the storm.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:23.360]   I think the hurricane force winds of this storm only went out something like 70 miles
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.280]   from the eye, something like that.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:32.520]   So realistically, it's a relatively small area as the storm moves at which the hurricane
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.000]   force winds are the highest and the most intense.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.120]   Where I live here on the East Coast, we were affected by the hurricane winds, but not affected
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.160]   by the strongest of winds.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.760]   And so when you're thinking about a hurricane evacuation plan, it's important to keep that
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.760]   in mind.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.240]   30 miles to the north, 30 miles to the east, even in this storm, it made a 20-mile jog
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:58.480]   that made a big difference in its impact to the property over on the West Coast of Florida.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:03.360]   So these small movements can make a big difference in terms of any danger.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.880]   The other aspect of hurricanes is always water and the water is twofold.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.720]   Number one, it's rainfall and flooding events in areas that are prone to flooding.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:18.000]   If you live in an area that's prone to flooding, a neighborhood that's prone to flooding, that
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.880]   needs to be taken carefully because flooding kills more people every year than almost any
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.520]   other natural disaster.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.200]   So this would be what would apply to a city that is built in a low-lying area, a city
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.800]   like a Hurricane Katrina, a city like New Orleans or a city like Houston or any other
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.720]   city that's low-lying and is prone to flooding.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.920]   That needs to be taken seriously.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.600]   Or if you're in a neighborhood that's in a flood zone.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.360]   The other aspect of hurricanes is storm surge, water that's pushed in from the ocean, pushed
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:51.640]   in from the lake, pushed in from the waterways and rises to a high level and gives localized
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.640]   flooding.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:58.380]   So if I lived in a flood zone or if I lived in a storm surge zone here on the East Coast
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.760]   of Florida, then I would always leave.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.600]   I would always leave that property because that's hard to defend against.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.760]   It's one thing to get an adult out of a flood.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.320]   It's another thing to get three small children out of a flood.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:15.080]   So those things don't apply to us and those were some of the reasons why we didn't evacuate
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.640]   immediately.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:22.600]   As we watched it, as my wife became – started to feel better and as we watched the storm
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:27.440]   track, we wound up actually just staying right at home.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:32.120]   And for her comfort and for our children's comfort, that wound up being the best decision
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.080]   and I'm satisfied with it.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.080]   We were ready to go.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.200]   So I felt confident that with being ready to go, we could be on the road and we could
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.980]   – if we needed to get out, we could.
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:46.240]   But given the constraints at hand, I think we made a good decision.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.920]   Feel like I had to give that defense because I felt a little hypocritical doing a show
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.880]   on evacuation and then a week – and evacuating early and a week later, not evacuating.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.440]   But I don't see any inconsistency.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.560]   I'll have to listen to both my shows and make sure that there's nothing in my commentary
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.760]   that is inconsistent.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:09.400]   I did learn some important lessons for myself and some of my own – the holes in my own
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:14.680]   planning and preparation for hurricanes or events like that and kind of did a little
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.280]   mini after-action review to understand what went well and what didn't go well.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.600]   Probably the biggest impact for me, the biggest lesson I'll share with you – of course,
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600]   some lessons are private.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.240]   I don't wish to share them publicly.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:30.840]   But the biggest lesson that I learned is one of the benefits of being prepared for an event
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:39.080]   like a hurricane in advance is it allows you to have more margin, more capacity to handle
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.320]   when things are really tough.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:48.200]   It was really tough to have my wife sick and generally, I have a good amount of support,
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.400]   family and friends that can help out.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.560]   But of course, with the hurricane going on, everyone else has their own responsibilities.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.640]   We don't often get to choose the – we don't get to choose the emergencies that hit us
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:03.360]   and we don't get to choose sometimes how the emergencies pile up.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:10.840]   Being sick is ordinarily an annoyance but it's a much more severe annoyance if it
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.360]   comes at the time of a hurricane.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:20.040]   So I underestimated the impact of that and I was glad that I wasn't caught entirely
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.040]   red-handed.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:25.000]   I wasn't caught without having any hurricane preparations in place.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.880]   So I was able to care for my wife and I was able to care for our children.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.840]   I also learned a lot about just the impact of tiredness.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.640]   Our baby – there's nothing life-threatening about his sickness but he's not sleeping
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.640]   well.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.240]   So you put him down in his crib and he doesn't stay asleep even with multiple times.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:49.120]   So we wound up for two or three nights just taking shifts of sleeping with him in a chair
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.960]   and I don't sleep well sitting upright in a chair and that leads to tiredness.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.560]   Crankiness and that's where I'd be very careful.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.280]   Am I still making good decisions in the middle of being tired?
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:07.960]   And so it just made me realize that oftentimes the value of having money and financial preparations,
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:12.480]   the value of having an emergency fund is often not that you can't get through an emergency
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:20.720]   without money but you can get through an emergency with less stress.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:25.600]   People get through their emergencies all the time even when they don't have money.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.160]   But the stress is often very, very impactful and that stress has a wearing effect.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.400]   It has a wearing effect in their own lives, their own health.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:40.160]   The stress causes health problems in the long term, has an effect on their relationships
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.840]   and on their general sense of life.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:49.960]   And so having something as simple as an emergency fund lowers the stress level and it doesn't
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.080]   mean that you don't go through the problems but it means your experience of problems is
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.360]   often different.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.240]   Similar thing with something like hurricane preparations or maybe it's winter blizzard
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   preparations.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.200]   If you have hurricane supplies on hand at the beginning of hurricane season, then the
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.760]   experience of the hurricane is less stressful.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.240]   I had actually planned that I was going to have a very productive week even with all
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.240]   the hurricane preps.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:17.560]   Yeah, a few hours here and there but I had planned to have a productive week.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.800]   That was just simply shot by the sickness in my family.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:28.400]   Would have been far worse if I was stressed about picking up a case of water to ride out
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.320]   the storm in that context.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.880]   And so I realized just afresh that a lot of times the reason it's important to prepare
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:41.160]   for something like a hurricane is it maximizes the enjoyment, allows you to focus on things
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.160]   that matter.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.400]   And if it's not enjoyment, at least it allows you to minister to the people that you care
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.680]   about, allows me to care for my wife to the best of my ability and make sure that she's
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.240]   well cared for.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:58.040]   And I always have to use the opportunity to talk myself down off the wall.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.400]   I'm a very kind of output-focused person.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.120]   I want to get stuff done, check stuff off.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.320]   I don't enjoy just being.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.480]   I wasn't able to turn my computer on for about three days because there was no opportunity
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.480]   to do so.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.720]   I like to work on my computer when my children are around.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.400]   And so just was with them, caring for them.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.680]   And I just was reminded afresh.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.600]   It's one thing to talk about, "Hey, I want to spend time with family."
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.120]   It's another thing to say, "Okay, I'm going to spend time with family even if it costs
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.260]   me, and I'm not getting the things done that I had planned to be done with."
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.640]   So that is my report for you, my friends.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:39.760]   I share that out of a sense of personal camaraderie, knowing that many of you will enjoy that,
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.480]   enjoying hearing a little bit of what I've learned and to share a little bit of my story.
