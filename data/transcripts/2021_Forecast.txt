[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and happy 2021.
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.860]   Hopefully everybody made it through 2020.
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.060]   That's not something we should take for granted given all that has happened.
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.040]   But I'm still here and hopefully most of you are still here as well.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.960]   We had a really good 2020 in terms of our investments, but in terms of lifestyle, not
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.340]   so much.
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.320]   So in this episode, I want to talk about my 2021 forecast for stocks, bonds, the 10 year
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.520]   bond yield and real estate.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.840]   I'm assuming stocks, bonds and real estate makes up a majority of your net worth.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.040]   It does for me about 70%.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.000]   So that's what I'm going to focus on.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.800]   So let's get started because 2020 was a great year.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.560]   The S&P 500 was up 16% and the Nasdaq was up about 42%.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.760]   I mean, it is crazy how much wealth has been built, at least here in the San Francisco
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.760]   Bay Area.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.320]   I talked to my friends who play softball and a preschool friend of mine is up like a couple
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.200]   of hundred thousand dollars because of his Tesla investment.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.160]   And I can't imagine how much people who actually work in tech have made.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.200]   We saw some really big IPOs.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.600]   The latest one was Airbnb.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.120]   They raised money at an $18 billion valuation at the bottom of 2020.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.600]   And then it IPO at $50 billion and then it doubled to $100 billion.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.520]   And that firm employs several thousand people.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.640]   So it really feels like there's a big dichotomy between the investor class and the non-investor
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.640]   class.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.920]   And I hope all of you guys listening and reading Financial Samurai are part of the investment
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.920]   class.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.680]   And if you weren't in the investment class in 2020, that you strategically and confidently
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.120]   leg into the market and try to build your wealth through investments.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.360]   There are no guarantees in investments.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.780]   I'm doing my best to try to forecast things because I'm putting real money to work, guys.
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.640]   Real money to work because it's really meaningful to support my family.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.720]   Now, I'm not just talking jibber jabber and just pontificating for the fun of it.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.920]   It's the same thing with writing.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.360]   I'm not writing just to write for fun.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.600]   I am putting in real money that I have saved, that I've worked hard to create so that I
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.120]   can provide a better life for my family and stay free.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.120]   And here's an inside tip for those of you who want to continue listening to this podcast
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.200]   or reading Financial Samurai.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.880]   I don't reveal everything that I do.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.220]   At the end of the day, I like to protect my private life.
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.640]   So I talk about maybe 25, 30% of the things that I think about and I like to do.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.160]   And the rest, I just respect my family's privacy.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.200]   However, a lot of the things that I do write about are things that are on my mind.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.120]   They are things that I'm actually probably going to do.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.080]   I won't say that I'm doing it exactly, but just know that, let's say, if I'm thinking
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.440]   about writing about real estate in 2021, and if I'm bullish, I'm probably going to be buying
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.860]   real estate before things take off.
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.860]   That's just the way I am.
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.460]   I try to say and write what I believe in and then take action accordingly.
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.600]   So let's start with the 10-year bond yield.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   The 10-year bond yield is the risk-free rate of return.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.960]   And everything, I believe, starts with the 10-year bond yield.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.200]   Once you've made a proper forecast of the 10-year bond yield, you can then proceed to
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.720]   make your appropriate investments.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.640]   So if you've been reading or listening to Financial Samurai since 2009, you know that
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.480]   I've consistently believed the 10-year bond yield would stay low or keep going lower.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.000]   America has contained inflation for the most part.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We've learned from many previous economic cycles.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.600]   We have globalization where inflation or deflation is imported.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.440]   Technology makes information flow instantly.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.360]   And the Federal Reserve boards around the world are all globally coordinated.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.080]   So with this in mind, I do believe the 10-year bond yield will increase in 2021 back up to
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.920]   an average of about 1.25%.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.200]   So we got down to about 0.51% in 2020.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.880]   That's the record low.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.040]   And we've rebounded since.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.360]   By the end of 2020, we were at about 0.91%.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.200]   So I'm talking about going from 0.91% to about 1.25%.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.160]   I don't believe the 10-year bond yield will breach 1.5%.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.980]   Once we take a step function down in rates, it's really hard to move back up due to expectations.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.640]   It's kind of like lowering taxes.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.480]   Once you start lowering taxes, the population expects taxes to be low.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.280]   The smart, smart population will put aside reserves for future tax hikes.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.720]   But it's just one of those things where once you start, it's hard to go back.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.240]   I also believe the aggregate bond market will have a flat year.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.160]   You can see a situation where the aggregate bond market index will be flat by principal
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.080]   values going down, but being made up by bond yields.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.760]   It's not going to be an exciting year for bonds, I don't think.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.840]   So therefore, you may want to be trimming your bond positions or just not expecting
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.360]   bonds to do much at all for you and for your net worth.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.640]   Now let's move on to my S&P 500 outlook for 2021.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.100]   I believe it's going to go up, but I just don't believe it's going to go up as much
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.160]   as it did in 2020.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.960]   My 2020 bottom call was spot on.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.200]   I wrote the call on March 18th, 2020.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.400]   I said about 23, 2400 on the S&P 500 is going to be the bottom, and that's what happened.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.640]   And so we bought, hopefully you bought, and you held on and you didn't panic too much.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.480]   Now it's obviously easy to panic when things are going down 30% in one month, but hopefully
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.560]   that helped give you some kind of confidence.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.480]   On the negative side, I certainly did not expect the rebound to be as quick or as much.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.320]   So as a result, I did not buy enough on the way up.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.840]   For 2021, I expect the S&P 500 to increase by about 8%.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:01.320]   So that's half the rate of return of 2020 with a year end target price of 4,088, lucky
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.320]   88.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.520]   If the S&P 500 generates an EPS of $165 a share, that puts valuations at about 25X.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.980]   And 25X is at the historical high over the past about 20 years.
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.200]   So valuations are clearly expensive.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.400]   However, it's about the valuation and about the expected earnings rebound in 2021.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.520]   So 2020, the earnings EPS is going to be about $131 per share.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.140]   We don't know what fourth quarter is yet, but that's the estimate.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:40.860]   So if you estimate 165 plus earnings per share in 2021, we're talking about 25% plus earnings
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.860]   growth.
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:49.720]   Now, depending on where your estimate is for 2021, it could be as much as a 35% to 40%
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   earnings rebound.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:58.240]   So on a relative basis, 25X with at least 25% earnings growth puts it at a one times
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.320]   price to earnings growth ratio, which is somewhat reasonable if the earnings happens.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.360]   It's really interesting and worth noting that about 90% of the S&P 500's market capitalization
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.520]   is now based on intangible assets such as research and development, IP and software.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.680]   Therefore you can make an argument that valuation should go up over time because these type
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:29.680]   of businesses have higher operating profit margins and are scalable and are more defensible.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.160]   We all have seen the dichotomy between businesses that were forced to shut down in 2020 and
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.680]   businesses that were able to keep on operating in 2020.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.600]   I'm looking at, for example, blog valuations.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.040]   I talked to numerous suitors in 2020.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.560]   It was really interesting.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.640]   And valuations alone for blogs are up 20% to 50% in 2020.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.800]   Again, because good cash flow, high operating profit margins, and they cannot be shut down.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.480]   So let's put my target price of $4,088 for the S&P 500 in 2021 in perspective.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.960]   Let's look at a couple of Wall Street firms that I know do a pretty good job over time,
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.040]   Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.560]   Goldman Sachs has a year end target price of $4,300 and JP Morgan has a year end target
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.400]   price of $4,400.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:24.800]   Specifically JP Morgan's 2021 EPS estimate is for $178 per share.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.960]   That's a 36% earnings rebound.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.960]   That is aggressive.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:35.400]   I think these guys are forecasting way too high because of three things.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:41.880]   One, there's a risk of virus mutations that lower the current efficacy rates of existing
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.000]   vaccines.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.440]   Let's all pray that there's not a new coronavirus that makes our current vaccines impotent.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:53.720]   Two, the other big risk is that there's a slower than expected vaccine rollout.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.520]   And we're seeing that right now.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.960]   And this will have big consequences on the economic recovery.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.660]   It's probably going to delay the economic recovery from the end of 2021 to 2022 or later.
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.800]   At the current rate of the vaccine rollout, it's going to take five to 10 years until
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.640]   we reach herd immunity.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:17.080]   And a lot of us, including myself, are hoping we reach herd immunity by the end of 2021.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:23.000]   And the final risk, and it's out there but not certain, is that the Senate goes blue.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.320]   So there's two Senate seats in Georgia.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.040]   We've seen that one of the Senate seats has turned blue.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.520]   Maybe the other one will, which will create a 50/50 split in the upper house, and which
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.600]   means that Kamala Harris, if she becomes vice president, will be the deciding vote.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:44.280]   So on the negative side for investors, there could be higher regulation, more regulation.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.640]   Maybe I think we should certainly expect to see higher taxes, not only personal income
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.800]   taxes, but corporate taxes.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.680]   Joe Biden said on his campaign trail that that's what he's going to do.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.560]   So if he has power in the Senate or alignment in the Senate, then that's what's going to
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.560]   happen.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.560]   We're going to see more regulation and more taxes.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.760]   On the positive side for investors, we could see more stimulus, right?
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.400]   We could see $2,000 stimulus checks to families who make under $150,000 or individuals who
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.800]   make under $75,000.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:19.800]   And we see another round of stimulus checks if needed in the summer of 2021.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.600]   It could be just a hip parade of stimulus checks that someone's going to have to pay
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.880]   for, but not us in the short term, right?
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:33.800]   So whatever happens with the Senate, I think what you're going to see is investors maybe
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.080]   not caring so much.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.760]   They just want the results to be done, just like the presidential election.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:45.400]   Regardless of who won the presidential election in November 2020, the market just had a relief
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.960]   rally because they found out, "Okay, looks like Joe Biden won, so let's just get on with
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   it."
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.660]   It's one of those, "Let's just get on with things" kind of moment, because we know that
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:11:00.120]   politics doesn't really affect the S&P 500 returns.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   We've looked at history.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.560]   I've written a post about it.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.680]   The returns are kind of what they are regardless of who is in power.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.480]   But we do know that when there is gridlock, the returns tend to be better.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.640]   So just something to think about.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:20.820]   These are the three risk factors to very bullish S&P 500 2021 estimates by Wall Street.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.720]   For me, less bullish, much more pragmatic, but that's just the way I am, especially after
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.400]   a surprising good, good year.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.680]   In terms of sectors that will outperform, I think consumer discretionary financials
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.200]   and energy will perform pretty well.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.880]   These are the sectors that lag the most because they also got hit the most.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.680]   Financials, it's their time to shine.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:50.680]   The yield curve should steepen because rates are going up and it makes lending more profitable.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.640]   And I don't think tech investors should expect a similar type of outperformance as the economy
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.640]   rebounds.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.360]   I am overweight tech, and I'm probably going to underperform.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:06.000]   I think there's a 65% chance of big tech underperforming as the economy opens up.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.400]   The Nasdaq is trading at about 40 XPE.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.520]   That's the highest since 2014.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.520]   So it's expensive.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.920]   Now, obviously, it could continue going higher if earnings grow faster than expected.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.120]   But I just think there's going to be a sector rotation.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.000]   And unfortunately for me and other tech investors who've ridden the wave in 2020, there's just
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.360]   going to be a rotation into the underperforming sectors.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.120]   I will be investing in the stock market whenever there's a 1% to 2% dip.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.320]   We saw the dip the first day of trading in 2021.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.180]   I put some money to work, but I'm not aggressively investing.
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:48.240]   I will be maxing out the 401k, SEP IRA, Roth IRA for my kids, 529 plans, all that stuff.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.400]   But in terms of big money, it's really hard for me to put big money to work.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.160]   Big is just relative, just my bigger money.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.200]   And for you guys, it's up to you guys to decide.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.720]   But again, I only think there's going to be about an 8%, maybe 10% return in the S&P 500
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   in 2021.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.240]   Therefore, I can see opportunity elsewhere.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.160]   And that opportunity is in the real estate market for me in 2021.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.720]   The median home price in America went up about 8% to 8.5% in 2020.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:22.440]   So if you put down 20%, that's a 40% gross return on a 20% down payment.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.060]   This level of growth is simply unsustainable.
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:32.280]   So I think for 2021, the national median growth rate will hover more around 5%.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:39.480]   5% is the level of growth we've seen more aligned to 2015 and 2017 levels.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.720]   Meanwhile, commercial real estate, I think is really, really interesting.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.880]   I think commercial real estate will start catching up as the economy opens up.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.320]   There should be deals to be had in the hospitality and office space.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.320]   If you are a vulture, you should be looking at these spaces for people who own these properties
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.880]   that just cannot hold on until the economy opens.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.600]   It's sad, but that is capitalism.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:11.600]   People who are over leveraged with hospitality and office space, those are probably the opportunities
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.440]   you should really look at.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.440]   Mortgage rates won't increase by more than 25 basis points on average, if my prediction
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.480]   on the 10-year bond yield is correct.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:27.240]   So in other words, instead of getting a 2.75% average 30-year fixed rate mortgage, maybe
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.240]   it goes to 3%.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.480]   3% is still way low.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.360]   I don't think it's going to go much over 3.25% because I don't think the 10-year bond yield
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.040]   is going to go over 1.5%.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.880]   So mortgage rates are going to continue to stay low, which is going to continue to be
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.800]   a nice tailwind for the real estate sector.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.920]   I think what's also going to happen is that people who've had huge stock gains will shift
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.800]   some of that money into real estate.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.440]   And I think there's going to be an increase in appetite for cash-flowing rental properties
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.580]   given the value of income has gone way up because interest rates have gone way down.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.720]   And this is a constant theme going forward for me.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:09.280]   It takes a lot more capital to generate the same amount of risk-adjusted income.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:15.400]   But you're seeing rental properties, they haven't grown nearly as much as the increase
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.800]   in the value of their cash flow.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.700]   Once you've made huge principal gains, especially gains that you didn't expect, I think most
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:27.400]   of us did not expect these type of stock gains, equity gains in 2020, you want to convert
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.520]   some of these gains into a steady income stream or into real assets.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:37.320]   If you follow the strategy, I think you're going to build a lot of wealth going forward
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.240]   and you're going to be able to protect a lot of that wealth going forward.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:47.560]   So again, the opportunity in real estate lies in buying hospitality, office, and also multifamily
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.880]   properties, rental properties.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:56.880]   You really want to gain that cash flow because imagine earning a rental increase and a principal
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.880]   gain increase.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.200]   That's a double win, folks.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.320]   And I think that's what's going to happen as the market gets better, stronger, and everything
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.320]   rebounds.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.360]   Further, strategically, I like buying real estate where there is the biggest difference
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:13.260]   in company share price performance and local real estate price performance.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.640]   For example, the NASDAQ closed up 42% in 2020.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.640]   Therefore, you want to buy real estate in places like the San Francisco Bay Area and
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.200]   Seattle where many of the NASDAQ companies are located.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:31.840]   The returns on Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, which account for about 25% of the
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.840]   S&P 500 now, were so massive and they employ hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.840]   It's only logical.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.040]   You just talk to the people who live in these areas.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.880]   They're like, "Yeah, we're looking at buying a bigger house.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.880]   We're looking at upgrading.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.520]   We're going to get a second house, yada, yada, yada."
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.520]   It's there, folks.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.480]   I am here in San Francisco.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.720]   I talked to my softball friends, my friends from tennis.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.680]   People are putting their money to work and they're thinking to themselves, "I just had
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.120]   a surprise huge windfall.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.720]   I want to spend my money on a better life."
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:09.200]   And that's why we're expecting 25% plus earnings rebounds in 2021 and beyond, because people
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   have pent up savings and huge windfalls to spend.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.440]   I also believe big city real estate will make a nice comeback in the second half of 2021
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.440]   and 2022.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.480]   Therefore, you want to strategically buy before the comeback is really evident.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:29.120]   One of the great things about being in San Francisco since 2001 is that I've seen the
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:38.160]   herd come back by 2003 after the first 2000.com crash and by 2012 after the 2008 and 2009
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.680]   financial crisis.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:47.000]   The herd always waits for the green light, always, at least in these previous cycles.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   It's just the way it is.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.760]   We want to see safety.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:56.160]   We want to see things go up 50%, 100% first before we start putting our money to work.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.960]   But the savvy investor, the one who's willing to take a little bit more risk or at least
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.200]   strategically leg in before there's a green light, tends to make the most amount of money
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.420]   over time.
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:12.080]   At the same time, I continue to believe in investing in the heartland of America.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.800]   Not only is there a fanning out within cities to save on living costs, I saved 40% on my
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.100]   living costs by just moving three miles west in 2014 in San Francisco.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:27.840]   There's also a fanning out across the country thanks to technology and the permanent acceptance
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.440]   of working from home.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.100]   This is a multi-decade trend.
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.100]   That's not going to stop.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.940]   So you want to look at obviously the 18-hour cities.
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.640]   Austin is getting all the publicity, but then there's Miami, right, getting a lot of the
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.320]   VC publicity.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:48.440]   It's kind of nuts, but this is just the herd looking at where else things are going.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.720]   Remember, we've been talking about that since 2014 and 2017 here on Financial Samurai, and
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.160]   it's really kind of taking off now.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.680]   So if you're a listener and you're a reader, it's about practicing, predicting the future,
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.680]   forecasting the future.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.520]   You're obviously not going to get it right all the time, but just think about where things
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.800]   are going forward.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.660]   And I think heartland of America real estate is obviously going to be a beneficiary of
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.320]   demographic trends going forward.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:21.980]   All right, so we've talked about stocks, bonds, the 10-year bond yield, and real estate.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.440]   So what we haven't talked about, which is going to be really important, at least starting
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.160]   in the second half or the middle of 2021, is inflation.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.920]   The discussion about inflation is really going to pick up steam, especially if the Fed stays
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.960]   accommodative and stocks and real estate continue to go up.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.240]   Let's say stocks and real estate are up another 5 plus percent by June 2021.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.880]   Undoubtedly, we're going to talk about inflation.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:54.160]   And when we talk about inflation, we talk about an eroding purchasing power of the dollar.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.680]   We talk about the K-shaped recovery some more where people are getting left behind.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.920]   We'll talk about the job market, how it's heating up.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.760]   And ultimately, we'll talk about why the Federal Reserve will probably have to raise interest
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.760]   rates.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.400]   Again, this is if everything is going fine and dandy, everything is going up, and so
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.400]   forth.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.600]   So inflation is something that is too powerful of a force to combat.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.800]   You always want to at least get neutral inflation.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.480]   You get neutral inflation by investing in stocks and in real estate.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.120]   So in terms of real estate, you want to at least own your primary residence.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:34.000]   This way, you can at least ride the inflation wave up and down, up and down.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.660]   You're enjoying, you're appreciating asset, hopefully.
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.800]   It's a wonderful combination, which is why I like real estate the most, or at least I
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.080]   prefer real estate over stocks.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.160]   But in an inflationary environment, what you really need to do is go long real estate by
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.060]   owning more than one property.
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.880]   This way, you can benefit from capital appreciation and rental appreciation.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:59.080]   And you can benefit by collecting those rents or selling off your real estate that has appreciation.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.560]   Because you've got to live somewhere.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.520]   You just can't sell your primary residence.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:08.720]   And then if you go and rent, then you become a price taker, not a price dictator.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.060]   So there you have it, folks.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:17.440]   I think with a 75% probability, 2021 should be a profitable year for stocks and real estate.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.760]   And if something bad happens, you know something bad is going to happen.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:28.320]   You know we're going to have 5%, 10% corrections here and there, because valuations are expensive.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.100]   Everybody seems to be really, really optimistic about the future.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.960]   So if something bad happens, you know we can count on Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.400]   Chair, and Joe Biden to bail us out.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.320]   There's no way they can't bail us out, since they just got into power.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.040]   And once you get power, you start getting addicted to power.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.720]   And you want to hold on to that power as much as possible.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.160]   So I believe the government is going to look out for us.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.320]   And they should.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:01.160]   I also think there is a massive amount of savings that is ready to be unleashed.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.680]   Take a look at your own balance sheet.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.760]   Do you have a lot of savings now, more than last year?
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.040]   Hopefully the answer is yes.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.360]   Ask your friends and colleagues whether they've got large cash buffers.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.080]   Chances are high, and they probably do, because the national savings rate has been elevated
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.160]   since March 2020.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.880]   You saw the savings rate go up to like 33% in April 2020.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.240]   I mean, it's been coming down, but it's still much higher than the national average before
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.640]   the pandemic of about 6%.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:37.120]   So this unleashing of savings is really going to be instrumental for the 25% plus S&P 500
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.720]   corporate earnings rebound, and for real estate going forward.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:46.600]   I know personally, I have a goal of spending at least one month in Oahu at the end of 2021
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.080]   to spend more time with my parents.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:56.120]   I'm going to spend whatever it is to try to catch up on a life missed in 2020.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.640]   And I think everybody has the same idea.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.320]   So let's just remain positive, stay focused.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.760]   75% chance that things will go well in 2021.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.640]   But that also means there's a 25% chance that stocks and real estate have a bad year and
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.640]   things go poorly.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.000]   Therefore, don't over leverage yourself, please.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.240]   Don't go crazy like we've seen in previous bubbles or really bullish times like 1999.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.560]   Please don't go on too much margin and overextend yourself.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.560]   Thanks so much, everyone.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:33.720]   If you enjoyed this podcast, I'd love a positive review, maybe some commentary to keep me motivated.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.160]   I realized that I haven't done one in over a month.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.080]   And it's because there's just other things to do.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.040]   And your feedback, your positive feedback will keep me motivated.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.760]   And I'm gonna try to get my wife on and we're gonna talk about the future, hopefully in
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.680]   a new episode going forward.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.920]   Thanks so much and stay safe.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.240]   And let's hope for a profitable 2021.
