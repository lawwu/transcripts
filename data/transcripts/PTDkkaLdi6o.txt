[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   In the playground at the grammar school at Tregaran,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.480]   towards the end of the summer term, in the year 1913,
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.560]   a schoolmaster pushed a book into the pocket of a 13-year-old pupil.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.520]   It wasn't a school book, it wasn't a textbook,
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.040]   it was a life of Howell Harris,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.080]   one of the great evangelical leaders of the 18th century.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.640]   The pupil, of course, was David Martin Lloyd-Jones,
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.640]   and it was one of the first of many books that would have so influenced his life.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.200]   I have the privilege of speaking for a few moments
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.120]   on the place of Christian literature in the ministry of Dr Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.640]   And surely the first thing to be said is that his whole life and ministry
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.160]   was a testimony to the power and to the influence of Christian books.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.640]   Not simply that first book, but so many that followed.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.560]   After his conversion about the age of 23, 24,
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.040]   he was constantly reading.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.920]   When he began his ministry, and people noticed how different it was,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.040]   how unusual it was, had anyone asked him, as sometimes they did,
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.040]   the reasons for that difference,
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.160]   one reason he would have given was that the books that were his companions
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.480]   were different books from those that the majority were reading.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.600]   And then as that ministry developed and he came to London,
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.040]   how often, how repeatedly, he held up to us
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.440]   the great privilege that we have in the English-speaking world
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.960]   of a great heritage of Christian literature.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.800]   His whole life was a testimony to the power
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.880]   and to the importance of that truth.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.080]   And yet as one says that, it is possible to wonder for a moment
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.920]   whether there was not a certain inconsistency in Dr Lloyd-Jones.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.320]   In this respect, Robin Wells has just mentioned how
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.160]   the InterVarsity Fellowship brought out his Sermon on the Mount.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.000]   But that was done when Dr Lloyd-Jones was in his 60th year.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.600]   In other words, although he was constantly recommending books
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.000]   and urging books and helping them forward,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.240]   they were not his own books.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.080]   And he was actually in his 60th year before he printed a major volume.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.480]   There were indeed smaller works before that,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.320]   but generally speaking, very few.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.680]   There was one writer in an InterVarsity magazine in the year 1952,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.720]   and he said that Dr Lloyd-Jones so rarely appears in print
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.200]   apart from the monthly transcripts of sermons
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.360]   which appear in the Westminster Record,
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.520]   can only be regretted in view of his supreme gift.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.440]   But why was that, my friends?
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.720]   Why was the doctor so slow in coming forward with books?
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.320]   There are two main reasons.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.800]   There are others, but two briefly.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.560]   One was that supremely he was committed to the preaching
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.200]   of the Word of God with the living voice.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.680]   That was his supreme commitment.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.720]   Let me read you the words of one whom Dr Lloyd-Jones resembled so much.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.760]   John Knox, you know, only published one sermon,
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.160]   and he felt it necessary to give a sentence or two of explanation.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.840]   And this is what Knox said.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.840]   "Wonder not that all my study and travail within the scriptures of God these twenty years,
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.640]   I have set forth nothing in expounding any portion of scripture.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.560]   I consider myself rather called," he says, "of God,
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.680]   to instruct the ignorant, comfort the sorrowful,
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.560]   confirm the weak, and rebuke the proud,
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.720]   by tongue and lively voice in these corrupt days,
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.640]   than to compose books for ages to come."
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.720]   Well, that was part of the reason.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.320]   But another reason why Dr Lloyd-Jones' large works came so much later
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.880]   was very directly due to the providence of God.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.760]   You know, I am sure that his books and other good books
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:28.200]   could have been available at other times and not have been wanted, not have been read.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:35.800]   His preaching was so mightily used to prepare the way for the literature,
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.280]   to change the climate, to change the atmosphere,
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.240]   so that there was the beginning of a spiritual hunger that made people turn,
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.000]   not to the commonly read books, but to turn back to books that had been forgotten
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.120]   and books that supremely honored God.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.000]   It is the preaching of the word that paves the way for books.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.400]   It was no accident then that Dr Lloyd-Jones put that first.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.600]   And then, of course, there came that day early in the year 1968,
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.200]   which we all saw at the time, as we thought,
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.160]   as a great setback for the cause of the church.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.480]   Dr Lloyd-Jones' ministry in this pulpit came to an end.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.640]   He was seriously ill for a time.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.520]   And yet he knew at once, as he says in his own words,
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.480]   "I felt that God was saying to me, 'This is the end of one ministry and the beginning of another.'"
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.960]   And God granted him another 13 years of life.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.360]   And that stream of books that had gone out under his name became a flood
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.120]   and went round the world in more than 50 nations,
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.960]   in upwards of a million copies,
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.320]   not only in English, but in other languages, in French, in Spanish, in Afrikaans,
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:10.280]   and in other countries, and reached literally the far corners of the earth.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.400]   There's a great deal that could be said tonight, and there is not time.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.440]   I've had the privilege of seeing letters that have come in from people in all parts of the world,
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:27.720]   a psychiatrist writing to say that so often he finds that Dr Lloyd-Jones' book on spiritual depression
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.320]   is the very book that can help so many of his patients.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.520]   Letters from missionaries in far-off New Guinea,
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.520]   speaking of what his book has meant on their mission station.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:45.320]   Letters from parents saying what one book has done in reintegrating their family life
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.800]   and the blessing it has brought upon their home.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.160]   My friends, there are multitudes of cases.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.760]   We are this evening but a little fraction of the people who across the world
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.480]   are sitting under the ministry of his written word.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.720]   Now, what were the characteristics of his books? Let me just give you two.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.880]   One, their spirituality. They were spiritual books.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.720]   That is to say, they not only instruct the mind, but they speak to you.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.080]   They speak to your heart, to your conscience.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.280]   They do something to you. They are spiritual books.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.120]   And you know, one great proof of their spirituality is this,
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:33.880]   that the appeal that they have has got nothing whatever to do with culture or education.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.040]   I'm afraid there are many educated people in the religious world
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.920]   who don't read Dr Lloyd-Jones' books.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.480]   And there are multitudes of uneducated persons, as well as educated,
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.040]   who read them and devour them.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.880]   The difference is where there is spiritual hunger, where we are hunger-bitten,
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.240]   where we want something to bring us nearer to God,
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:03.400]   wherever that is, wherever it exists, then people relish the books of Dr Lloyd-Jones.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.240]   Just last week I heard a pastor from Yugoslavia,
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.200]   whose language is not English, of course, saying,
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.360]   and he has many of Dr Lloyd-Jones' books,
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.840]   that he has read each one of those books three times over.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.760]   They are spiritual books.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.960]   And secondly, they are timeless.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.120]   There's a freshness about them.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.080]   And the reason for that is that there is so much of the Word of God in them.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.320]   He was only a voice.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.200]   If you read his books, what you get is not an impression of a man,
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.520]   not anecdotes about what he was,
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.080]   but you get a messenger, and you get the Word of God speaking to you.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.480]   And my friends, it will speak, if God will, a hundred years from hence,
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.840]   and further on down the line of the Christian church.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.520]   They are timeless because they are indeed books
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.560]   which so supremely hold up the Word of God.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:06.680]   There's one text before I sit down which brings the whole thing together so perfectly.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.080]   In the epistle to the Hebrews in the 13th chapter and the 7th verse,
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:17.560]   the Holy Spirit says, "Remember them which have spoken unto you the Word of God.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.240]   You may remember other things, but this above all,
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:27.480]   that they spoke to you the Word of God, whose faith follow."
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.760]   Whose faith follow.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.680]   And there is not a soul in this building who hasn't the opportunity
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.360]   to know the faith of this servant of Christ,
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.280]   to know it not only now, but in days and years to come.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.760]   Whose faith follow.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:48.040]   Whenever you see his books, remember the exhortation of the Holy Spirit
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.280]   and remembering the end of their conversation.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.440]   That is to say that these who spoke to us the Word of God,
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.320]   they have passed out of this world.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:06.040]   For them, there came a time when the rain descended and the floods rose
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.440]   and the wind blew and they did not fall.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:17.240]   Dr. Lloyd-Jones died in triumphant hope, victoriously, in abounding peace.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.600]   Remember the end of their conversation and then finally Jesus Christ,
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.200]   the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.280]   It was Christ who made him all that he was.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.640]   The gifts that he had, the grace that he had, the message that he brought.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:41.320]   And that, Christ, says the scripture, is the same today and forever.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.520]   My Christian friends, we have indeed an obligation to thank God
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.080]   for that abundance of literature which came from his hand.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.800]   But more than that, not only to thank God,
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.720]   but to take it up, to read it, to pray over it,
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.440]   to pray that God would bless its message to all the ends of the earth
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:09.480]   and to use it for the advancement of the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:24.560]   [Silence]
