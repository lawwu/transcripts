[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   My name is Josh Rascheitz.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   I'm your host here with you every day.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And today is going to be a Friday Q&A show.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Going to be primarily handling two questions,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   the two questions I just mentioned,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   one about long-term care planning
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   and the other about my 401(k).
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And then if we have time, we'll get to some inspiring reading
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   for the weekend.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   ♪
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   So these two questions today are going to be challenging.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I don't expect them to be quick,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   but I do want to really give some good ideas
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   to the people that have asked the questions.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   As you know, I'm putting out these Friday Q&A shows
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   every week, and I think that next Friday
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   will be a lot better.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   So over the weekend, I should be able to get up
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   and add the application on the website
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   to allow you to phone in your feedback,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   so that way we can have a nice audio message
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   that we can play on the air.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And I'm excited about that.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   It'll help us to get a better feel for you as a caller,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   as a questioner.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It'll help us to get a little bit better of a feel
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   and a little bit more personal, instead of the more
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   impersonal emails and Twitter questions and answers
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   that I've been answering so far.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   So I should be able to get that up over the weekend,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   over the early next week, and then I will announce it
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   on the show as soon as that is ready to go.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And then I hope that you'll call them in.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   But today we've got two questions that we're going to deal with.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And then depending on how long the show goes,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I've got a variety of articles that I'd like to talk about.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   If we get to them, if not, we'll push them to Monday.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And so those two questions are going to be
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   a question about 401(k)s and then a question
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   about preparing for long-term care.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And I've struggled with which one to start with
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   because neither of them are easy questions.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   They're both pretty difficult for me to work through.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And I hope you'll see today kind of the real challenges
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   of financial planning because these are both
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   real people's situations.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And I don't have enough information to really give
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   a comprehensive, complete answer that's going to fully solve
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   the listeners' questions.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   But I'll try to give some ideas and point you
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   in the right direction.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And I think we'll lead off with the long-term care question.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I think we'll start with that, and then we'll go into
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   the 401(k) question afterwards.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   And so the long-term care question comes in from a listener.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And this listener asked that I not share his name.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   So we will keep this listener anonymous.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And by the way, I'm always happy to do that.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I will generally try, unless I goof up somewhere along the way
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   and mention something.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You know, the Twitter question coming in,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I'll mention your Twitter handle.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   But if you send me an email with a question,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I'll never read your name except just maybe your first name.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   So feel free to lie about that if you don't want me to read that
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   or feel free to say, "Please leave my name out of it."
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   So this listener was writing in to me about
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   a challenging family circumstance,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   and it involves long-term care.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And basically I'll summarize the facts for you.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Again, I don't have complete facts,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   but I was able to figure out some of the information.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I'll summarize the facts for you.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   This listener says, "My dad just had a stroke,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and he's in the hospital.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   He's getting out of the hospital, but he's not doing well.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And he's 81 years old, and his mom is about 20 years younger,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   so I'm assuming 61 years old, 62, somewhere in that range.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And evidently his health has not been good for a good number of years.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   He's actually been out of work for about 30 years
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   due to some physical problems that he's faced.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And now he's just had a stroke.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And then the good thing about the stroke
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   is that as part of being involved in the hospital
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and as part of being involved in the medical system,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   they diagnosed him as having some advanced degree of dementia,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   which really helped the listener to understand a little bit more
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   about what was going on.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   His relationship with his father had been very challenging
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   over the previous years,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   and now he understands a little bit better,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   ah, it was probably due partly to the dementia.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   And so that was really, in some ways,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   although it's not a pleasant diagnosis,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   in some ways it's really helpful to at least understand
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   that there's some real chemical issue in the brain
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   that would help to explain some of the off behavior.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   But the problem is, what do we do?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   We're not exactly sure what to do.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Mom and dad live alone.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   They're together.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   They're together with each other, but they don't live with any family.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   They're about an hour or so away from the sun,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   so quite a ways away.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   The listener says, "I'm not able to financially,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   "due to my situation,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   "I'm not able to make a large contribution."
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   And so I inquired about some of the numbers,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   and he shared with me,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   "Dad has about $800 a month coming in in Social Security income.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   "Mom works and makes about $18,000 a year doing various things."
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   So if you add those numbers together,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   they give you an annual income of about $27,600.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   They have maybe about $5,000 of savings,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and they have a paid-off piece of property,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   about three acres of land out in the country,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   maybe worth about $50,000,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   and then a mobile home on top of that
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   that's falling into disrepair little by little.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And so he's an only child, and he says, "What do I do?"
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And my heart goes out to him,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   because long-term care planning is something that's near and dear to my heart.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And I may have shared on a previous episode,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   my grandfather had dementia for, I think it was five or six years,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   somewhere about the age of about 90 to 95.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   It's hard with dementia to always pinpoint,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   "Here's exactly the point where it starts."
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Many of you have worked through it with a family member with dementia or Alzheimer's.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   It's hard to point and say, "This was the day that it happened."
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   But about five years is my memory is correct.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And it's just a steadily progressing disease
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   where it just steadily gets worse and worse and worse.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And it's so tough to see a loved one that you know,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   a loved one that you know and love going down.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And you don't have any hope that they're going to get better.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And it's especially tough to deal with as a disease
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   because it doesn't necessarily affect the body.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   It doesn't necessarily affect the physical health of the person who has the disease.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   So my grandfather, for example, he retired when he was in his mid to late 80s.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I get dates confused just about every time.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   He was 84, I think, is when he retired, something like that.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   But he was hearty and healthy and full of vigor and full of life.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Retirement kind of did him in a little bit.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Once he retired and actually sat down, he started to get old quickly.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   But then he started to face dementia.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And in working with dementia, I learned a lot kind of going through it as a young man
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   trying to work and help my parents out.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And it's really challenging.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And one of the biggest challenges of dementia is that it doesn't affect you physically.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   So you don't--unlike some diseases where you maybe have a diagnosis of cancer
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   and the physician may be able to estimate, well, this is your life expectancy,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   or some other diseases where you can say, well, this isn't necessarily expected
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   to affect your life expectancy.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   With dementia, it doesn't affect your physical health; it affects your mental health.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So you may be healthy as anything, and so it's very unknown as far as how to plan for it.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And yet it's extremely challenging and extremely draining to work through that
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   from a care perspective.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And so my heart went out to this listener.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And since I heard of his situation, I've just been thinking about the question
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   and thinking about the question, trying to figure out what the answer is.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   And it's tough because in some ways there is no answer.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And I'll try to do better than that.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I'll try to give some ideas, but in some ways there is no answer.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And I'm going to say some things, and I know the listener is listening,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and I just want to say my heart is filled with compassion and empathy,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   and I wish that I had some good answers for you.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I don't know of any good financial answer for the situation
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   because there's not a lot to work with.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And I'll give you ideas.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   I've got some ideas of some programs for you to research
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   and just kind of walk you through how I would approach it.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   But at the end of the day, I don't have a good answer.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   But I want to bring a situation like this forward to encourage the rest of you
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   to consider doing some planning up front.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Because if you'll do some planning in advance for these things,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   then it's not going to make them emotionally easier,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   but it may make them a little bit easier if there's some plans in place already.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And this is essentially how I think about financial planning.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I don't understand why people don't want to do financial planning.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   This has been one of those circuits in my head that has never made sense to me
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   because I guess I always joke about, well, you're going to die,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   so make sure you die with a will in force.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Chances are this could happen.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And for some reason that's never bothered me,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   but I know it really bothers some people to think about this planning.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   But I tell you, when you see somebody go through a tough situation,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   it really helps you to say, well, I've got to do some planning.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And you've got to do what you can.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   You've got to do what you can when you can.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I don't think necessarily financial planning is the magic cure
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   that's going to fix everything.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Not everybody is poor and broke because there's something somehow wrong with them morally
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   or that they're just somehow not smart.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   That's not the case at all.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   There is bad luck that happens.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   There are situations that are beyond people's control.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   People get beat down.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   There are things that can happen, and that's across the board,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   that things can happen to all of us.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And so I don't think there's any amount of planning that can guarantee anything.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   But I do believe that no matter the situation,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   a little bit of planning and some ideas can make the situation better.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   We see this all the time in our culture.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   That's why there are stories that are constantly written about somebody who is sick
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   and look at how even though they were sick or even though they were an amputee,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   they still ran the marathon.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I mean, bad luck can--if you're a soldier, bad luck.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   You walk over a bomb or an IED or a claymore or whatever they're called nowadays.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   You walk over a bomb and your legs are gone.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   That's bad luck.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   But once it's done, it's done.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   You've got to make the best of it.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   So that's kind of how I think about financial planning.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   So I'm going to do my best to give this listener some ideas,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   some very practical ideas, some programs to research,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   but also some big-picture ideas.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   But none of this is intended to be cruel,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   and it's a little hard when it's impersonal where maybe you can't sense my empathy
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   or my compassion, but I want to give you some answers.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   But I also want to use it as a learning experience.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   First thing, this situation, the listener being an only child
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   and having ailing, aging parents,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   and then this listener not being able to help his parents very much,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   this is the situation that we face generationally in this country.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   And right now it's especially prominent.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   The term that goes for it is the sandwich generation.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And I don't know if this listener has children or not,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   but it really doesn't matter.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   It's especially more difficult with children.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   But what happens is there are millions and millions of us throughout the country
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   who are now finding ourselves in this position
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   or who will find ourselves in the position in the future,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   who will find ourselves in the position of needing to care for our aging parents
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   and of caring for our own children at the same time.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And this is incredibly challenging and incredibly stressful.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And there are some demographic changes that have made this very challenging.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   And it comes down to the small number of children
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   and the dispersion of families and the adjustments and changes in lifestyle.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Now, I'm not going to make some values judgments on these things.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   You do what you want with them.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   But these are demographic realities, and they're facing all of us,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   which leads to the need for planning.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   And I'm going to draw some generalizations.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   I recognize they're generalizations, and they may not apply in every case,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   but I think it's important to understand and to think about
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   because this question does not need only a financial answer.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   In the past, traditionally, how have we cared for our elderly and aged parents?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Well, normally in the past, traditionally, the family unit was a lot tighter,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   a lot bigger, and a lot closer together.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   So in the past, we've had a society--
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   and again, I recognize I'm idealizing a little bit,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   but I still think it's valid to do so in this situation to draw the lesson.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   In the past, we've had a society where the family units were much closer together.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   So we look at the Norman Rockwell painting of traditional U.S. America,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   and we see the family sitting down for dinner every day.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Did that happen all the time? No.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Were their families broken apart? Yes.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   But more than there is now, the family unit was in many ways much tighter,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   much closer relationship.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   There was a much larger family unit,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   and the work among the family unit was generally more integrated.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   So in an agrarian society, it would be very normal that children would grow up
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   working with their parents every day, working with their parents,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   spending time with their parents, helping in the family enterprise.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Traditionally, in the traditional view, this would be an agrarian enterprise, a farm.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   So on a farm, the children are working with the parents every day
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   and really building this close-knit family.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   And then it would be unusual for the children to grow up and move very far away.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Traditionally, in agrarian societies, generally, people will live somewhat close
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   to where they were born and where they were from.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   And usually, you would have a high number of children,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   a much higher number of children than we have now.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   So maybe an average of 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 children,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   depending on what part of the world that you're in.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Well, if you fast forward to today and look at how different our lifestyles are--
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   OK, so before I go there, then as the parents age,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   traditionally, a farmer would never retire.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   I have a grandfather who was a farmer, the other grandfather,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   not the one who had dementia, although he also was a farmer, rancher, earlier in his life.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   But I have a grandfather who was a farmer, and he never retired.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   He died at 93 years old, and he never retired.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   He had to pull back.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   At the end of his life, he wasn't really able to go to the farm,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   but he was still working on paperwork.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And so traditionally, as you aged, you were still part of the family,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   still part of the community, and you just simply took over some of the easier jobs
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   that were less physically taxing.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   But you were still part and still very engaged.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   So I think people, because they felt engaged and as part of society, in my opinion,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I think people aged a little bit more gracefully, and the family was able to help.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   So if all of the work is centered around the home, and so on the farm you have the farmhouse,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   you have the fields and everything relatively nearby,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   and if all of the work is centered on the home, you're always going to have many people there working.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   It's much simpler to have caretakers around to care for the aging parents.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   And so this makes, traditionally, people cared for their parents themselves.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   They've been able to produce and be productive,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   even though they're not necessarily earning an income.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   A grandparent can care for a grandchild much more easily.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   A grandparent can still help out with certain less physically demanding tasks.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   And so this is kind of the historical view.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Well, fast forward, and there's been this dramatic shift over a couple of generations,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   and the dramatic shift has encompassed a few things.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Number one, instead of an agrarian society, you have an industrialized society.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   So instead of home-based employment, where the family unit is working together,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   we have out-of-the-home-based employment, where the family unit is split.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   And traditionally, the male in this country may have been out of the house,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   and now it's more normal that both parents are out of the house.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   So this leads to a much more fragmented family.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   This leads to less time with the parents spending time with the children.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   This leads to the need to hire people for the raising of children,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   which is where you have the public education system comes in,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   and whether it's aspects of education, which is usually how it's thought of,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   or whether it's aspects of child care, which I believe there is, if you go and study it,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   there would be some evidence to say that that wasn't necessarily ignored
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   when the system was established in the way it is,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   is that to make the transition to an industrialized society,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   and to incorporate both workers into the workforce,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   so that you can reduce the cost of the workers by increasing the supply of labor,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   go research it. I'm not convinced of it, but certainly there is literature
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   that would indicate that people were not surprised by that development.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Then, if you were to go and research this, you would find that we need something
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   to care for the children, so therefore you have school that happens during work hours,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   and this provides for the child care.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Well, this leads to a more fragmented family, where children and parents
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   have a less intimate relationship with each other.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   They may be very busy, less together.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   We're not working on a common family enterprise,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   but we're each working on our own enterprises.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Father and mother each have their own jobs.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Children are encouraged to have their own jobs,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   and it's unusual if you find a family that's working together.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Then this leads to a geographic dispersion, so with the increase in monetary wealth,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   with the pool of jobs, it's very abnormal for people to stay close to where they are at home.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   With the reduction of the number of children, you have a dramatic change,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   where now you have one or two children.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   You have one child, in the case of this author, and this child has two parents.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Instead of five children and two parents.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   So you have this dramatic generational change.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Two children, two parents, one child, two parents.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Then when you take that into a spouse, and you say,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   "Okay, we have a male spouse who has his parents, and a female spouse has her parents,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   and maybe there's one or two siblings among them."
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Now we wind up in a situation where we may have four parents and two children
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   to care for the four parents, or two, three, four children, depending on the numbers.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Then in an age of changing family dynamics,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   it's more likely that it's possible that the parents are divorced,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   and now we have parents and step-parents.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Now you're in a situation where instead of it just being one couple with a total of four parents,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   there's all the other step-parents involved.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   So it changes the dynamic.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   This is the reality that's facing the Social Security system,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   of the reduced number of workers that are working based upon the increased number of retirees.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   This is the challenge that's facing us demographically in this country.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Well, it hits close to home when it comes to long-term care,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   because that means that all of the responsibility for the care of the parents,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   should the child choose to assume that responsibility as a child,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   is placed upon one or two children.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   This can be very challenging.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   So with these demographic changes, it leads to a difficult situation.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   I point it out because it leads to a need for a whole new area of planning.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   It is simply how do we care for ourselves as we age?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   In the past, it was simple. Family. That was the answer.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   It's that the family will care for me, so there's no problem.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   The family had the capacity.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   But how on earth do you have the capacity nowadays?
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   How on earth do you have the capacity if you have children that are working,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   financially challenged, not able to necessarily do extremely well economically for them,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   and now they are faced with the challenge of supporting and being responsible for their parents
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   as their parents need to care as they get older?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   So then that leads to the natural growth of the government programs that are in place.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   That leads to those government programs being overly taxed,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   which is what has happened with the government programs for care.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   One of the things that I have observed in paying attention to it
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   is that while the expansion of traditional health insurance benefits has been steady over time,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   where those programs have been--the government has little by little increasingly picked up the expansion of those--
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   expanded their care up to and including the Affordable Care Act
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   and the changes that that has brought in the health insurance marketplace,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   it has been the--quietly over the last couple of decades,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   it has been the exact opposite in the areas of long-term care.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And long-term care meaning ongoing custodial care,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   not for a critical illness that is expected to get better,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   but ongoing custodial care for something that is not expected to get better.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   And so if you go back and you trace the history of the tax law--I won't do that today in a Q&A show--
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   but if you go back and trace the history, little by little,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   benefits have been removed consistently and steadily,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   even to the point of one of the things that got very little news,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   except among the professional advisor community,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   was there was a component of the Affordable Care Act called the CLASS Act.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And I think that CLASS, if my memory is correct,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   stood for Community Living Assistance Something or Other, something like that,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Community Living Assistance Program,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   and it was basically a federally organized version of long-term care insurance.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Well, the program was such a disaster, actuarially speaking,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   and everyone knew it was and everyone said it was,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   that it was just quietly eliminated about--I think it was a year or so after it was passed,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   maybe a couple of years--the dates are fuzzy in my mind.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   So the benefits that are available, the government benefits,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   facing this demographic problem, the government benefits have been steadily reduced,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   have been steadily drawn back because there's no money available to pay for them.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   And so this is a big, big area of planning that we need to pay attention to,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   especially as we're responsible for guiding people.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   I'm not going to go deep into long-term care plan today,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   but I'll tell you the one that ticks me off is when people put an age in for long-term care.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   "Well, you should start planning for long-term care at age 60."
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Guess what?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   You should start planning for long-term care as soon as you're around,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   but you need to figure out where it comes in in your terms of financial priorities,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   and I'll cover that another time.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   But if you can ever prove to me--this one drives me nuts--
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   if you can ever prove to me an age where all of a sudden it makes sense to plan for long-term care that age
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   and it didn't before that and it doesn't after that, it's absolutely ridiculous to put an age on this.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Plan for it when you can, and I promise we'll do extensive, in-depth planning shows on long-term care.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   So we need to do planning, and this is going to be a very challenging situation for this listener.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And I don't know how challenging.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   The listener's father may be in excellent shape after he comes out of the hospital
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   and may be able to care for himself,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   but then again he may need full-time care on an ongoing basis.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   And so it's impossible for, obviously, me to know,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   and I've just had an email that I'm answering publicly here,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   but I hope that I can have some thoughts and some ideas.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   So where I want to start with this is anytime you're starting with long-term care planning,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   start with the non-financial stuff.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Don't start with the numbers, because no matter what the numbers are,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   just start with the non-financial stuff.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   And the biggest misconception about long-term care is that it's a financial planning situation.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   It is, and you can do some things with financial planning, but I say start with non-financial.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   And in this situation, I want to speak directly to this listener,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   you need to do some careful thinking and research on the impact that care and caregiving has on family.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   It can be an incredible blessing to care for your aging parents.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   I consider myself very fortunate to have been able to serve and to honor
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   and to love my grandparents as they aged.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   What a way to give back for those who have cared for you and provided for you.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And my parents are in excellent health, but should the opportunity arise to care for them,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   I will consider it an honor and a blessing to be able to serve them in a way to honor our parents.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   So it is an incredible blessing.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   It's also an incredible challenge.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   And I want to read you some statistics here.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   And these statistics I'm pulling from, this is a little bit old,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   a 2004 National Alliance for Caregiving Survey.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   And there are a few different sources of this list of statistics that I'm going to read,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   but I think they hold valid.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   So first of all, the majority of care that is provided for people who are chronically ill
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   is provided by informal caregivers.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And informal caregivers simply means family members, unpaid caregivers.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   So this would be you caring for your parents and providing the physical daily care that they need.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Many children are going to be expected to care for their parents.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And the challenge is that caring for the chronically ill parent often makes the caregiver chronically ill.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And this is an incredible epidemic that most people just simply aren't familiar with.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   But I guarantee if you've been involved in the care of a parent or grandparent,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   you're nodding your head with me right now,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   is that it is a tremendous challenge and a tremendous burden on the family.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   It can be a joyful burden and an honor, like I said, but it's a burden.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   There's about 45 million informal caregivers in the United States, 21% of the adult population.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   So in 21% of households, there's an informal caregiver.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   60% of these informal caregivers are women, 40% are men.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Women still account for most of the caregiving hours per week, about 71%,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   although it is estimated that the percentages of men giving care will increase substantially
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   because future families will have fewer children.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   The median age of informal caregivers is 45 years old.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   62% of informal caregivers are married.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   41% have children under 18 at home.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Informal caregivers contribute on an average $200 out of their own pockets per month to subsidize care,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   so just simply contributing money out of pocket to pay for people to give them relief from the care.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   67% reported providing care between 8 and 20 hours per week.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   On average, an informal caregiver provides care for 4½ years.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Informal caregivers provided services that if they had been provided formally
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   would have cost around $350 billion, about the same as Medicare's total spending.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   22% of informal caregivers to the elderly are depressed, around twice the rate in the population as a whole.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   55% of caregivers living with dementia patients suffer clinical depression.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   I'm going to repeat that.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   55% of caregivers living with dementia patients suffer clinical depression.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   It is incredibly challenging to care for somebody with dementia on an ongoing basis,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   and you need to be very, very careful, very, very careful to make sure that you are providing the support for the caregiver.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   An elderly informal caregiver has a significant risk of death as a result of his or her sick spouse's hospitalization.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   The risk to spouses was highest when the hospitalization was for a chronic disabling illness like dementia.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Quote, "What this shows is that people are interconnected, and their health is interconnected,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   and seeing a person that you love suffer, seeing them ill, harms you,"
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   said study co-author Dr. Nicholas Christakis of the Harvard Medical School.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Elderly informal caregivers run a 63% higher risk of dying from stress-related illnesses.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Informal caregivers who responded that their health has gotten worse as a result of caregiving
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   most commonly report a loss of energy and sleep, 87%.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Stress or panic attacks, 70%.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Aches or pain, 60%.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Depression, 52%.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Headaches, 41%.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   And weight gain or loss, 38%.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   In addition, they tend to spend less time with family or friends, 69%, and at work, 37%.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Abuse of the elderly by family members has risen significantly,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   73% of caregivers listed prayer as the best way to cope with the stress and sadness of providing care.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Alzheimer's disease is a major cause of the need for long-term care.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   One in eight people 65 and older have the mind-destroying illness.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Half of all people over 85 are affected.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Ten million Americans are currently caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   and tend to be stressed to the breaking point financially, emotionally, and physically.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   The challenges about distance between -- the challenges about distance from parents.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   This is a study from MetLife.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   15% of caregivers leave at least one hour away from their parents.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   33% provide care at least once a week.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Respondents estimated that care and travel amounted to one full workday per week.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   23% reported that they were the only caregivers their parents had.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Nearly 50% stated they spent an additional 3.4 to 4 hours per week arranging or monitoring care.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   40% reported providing direct assistance with the most difficult activities of daily living.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Caregivers reported spending an average of $199 per month on travel,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   in addition to the $200 per month they spend to help their parents.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   And so one quote here from this book that I'm referencing here
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   is a quote out of a PBS documentary entitled "And Thou Shalt Honor It."
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   And one woman when being interviewed replied,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   "When I got married, I never really understood the vow in sickness and in health.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Now I do. His sickness, my health.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   For it to be easy for me, it would have to be over for my husband.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   That's unacceptable.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   I often wonder, will there be anything left of me when he passes away?
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Will there be anything left for me?"
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   It's probably a good place to stop.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   So I take a moment just to read those statistics
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   because I had seen prior to my learning those statistics,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   and I learned that years ago.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   I was reading those statistics from a manual that I had,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   a financial planning manual for a certification I got years ago
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   called the Certification in Long-Term Care Planning.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   And when I read those statistics, it was the first designation
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   that I went out and pursued after becoming a financial planner
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   because of my experience with it
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   and also because it was kind of an easier designation to get.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And when I read those statistics, I was just stunned.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   I had never had any idea.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   And, again, those are a little bit dated.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   I'm sure they're even more significant now.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   So I point them out to you just to be aware of them
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   because this makes a big difference.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Now, if you're aware of something, you can put plans in place
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   to avoid the major problems.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   So, for example, if you're aware of the fact that a tremendous percentage of parents--
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   I forget the statistics. I'll have to check them some other time.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   But if you're aware of the fact that there is a tremendously high divorce rate
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   among parents who have either lost a child to death
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   or who are dealing with a child who's disabled,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   then if you lose a child to death or you have a child who's disabled,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   you can plan for that and you can recognize, "My marriage is in danger.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   I need to take extra special steps for this."
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Or if you're aware of the fact that the majority of lottery winners
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   become broke or bankrupt soon after winning their lotteries,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   then if you win the lottery, then you can make plans
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and you can say, "Wait, I need some careful and special--
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   this doesn't have to happen, but I need to do something very carefully
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   to make sure that I avoid it."
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   So I spent a lot of time with those statistics to say,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   "You need to recognize," speaking to the listener,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   "You need to recognize that in the situation you described to me
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   with an 81-year-old father and a mother who's 20 years younger
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   who will be his primary caregiver,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   the tremendous amount of stress that she will be under
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   and how that can affect her health and her happiness tremendously.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   And you need to put plans in place to avoid that.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   You also need to recognize the tremendous stress
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   that it's going to place on you and on your marriage
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   and put plans in place to deal with that as best you can.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   It's going to be financial stress--
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   again, the average is $200 a month of contributions to pay a caregiver
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   to give your parents some sort of extra help,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   plus $200 a month of travel expenses just to get there.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   And you can understand if you live an hour away from your parents
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   and you're going to travel there for one hour a week--
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   excuse me, at least a day or two a week--
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   that's going to bring a tremendous financial burden
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   just doing gasoline and wear and tear on a vehicle.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   So we need to make some plans that are going to help to improve this.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Now, unfortunately, I don't have any good plans
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   because you've got to look at the actual situation.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   You've got to say, "Well, what do my parents need?
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   What do they have?
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Is there a way that we could somehow live together to diminish costs?"
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Now, that may or may not be possible depending on the situation.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   "Is there a way that I can contribute financially?
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Is there a way that--?"
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   You've got to find a plan.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   I'm going to talk through some of the benefits that you need to research
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   to see what's available to you as far as for extra help.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   But the big thing is not going to be any kind of benefits
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   because, frankly, there are none.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   And I say that as a blanket statement.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   There are a few, but there's generally not much.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   And this is because it's an epidemic that we're facing in the country.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And unless you've done prior planning
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   and unless you've saved money for this situation,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   unless you have money to pay for a caregiver, a formal caregiver,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   or unless you have something like a long-term care insurance policy
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   that can fund it, then there's not a financial solution.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   There's not.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   You have to commit to providing the care and figuring it out as you go.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Now, you shouldn't feel bad about not planning
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   because the reality is that if you had started five years ago with this planning
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   and you were sitting in my office and we said, "Okay, if your dad and mom
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   as we're sitting there and your dad is 75 years old,"
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   and then considering some of the other health problems that you shared with me,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I would have said there's nothing you can do.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   It's too late. It's too late.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   After those health problems, after you have certain health problems,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   you can't buy insurance, and you don't have the money, and you're not working.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   So don't beat yourself up about not doing the planning in the past.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Just recognize that it's going to be very much a non-financial answer,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   not so much a financial answer.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   So continuing on, okay.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   I've got to pick up the pace here.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   So what do you need to do?
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   You need to start researching.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   There is no one place that I would encourage--that I can send you to
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   to say, "Here's the information.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   I'm going to give you some ideas of some things that I think you need to research
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   and some programs to investigate," and a broad brush stroke of how they work to see,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   to see what may or may not be available to you.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   But the key is you've got to become a researching hound
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   to find the information that you need.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   It's not served up to you on a platter anywhere that I've ever been able to find.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   First of all, you said that your father was a Korean War veteran.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   This is good because there may be some veteran benefits,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   although it's usually unlikely.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   So first of all, what about veteran benefits of the traditional--the health insurance benefits?
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   You should know by this point what benefits your father is entitled to.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   And in general, the Veterans Administration will provide some long-term care benefits.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   And real quick, a quick thing you need to understand.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Long-term care--when I use that word, what long-term care refers to is
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   long-term care refers to something called a chronic illness.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   And a chronic illness is for something that's not expected to get better.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   So the example here would be Alzheimer's.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Alzheimer's is not expected to get better.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   There's no cure that anyone that I'm aware of, anyone has found for Alzheimer's.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   There's not really any treatment that I know that can be expected to improve it,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   although maybe it could be slowed down through brain stimulation and physical exercise.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   I've read some of the studies on that, but I'm not aware of somebody saying
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   we can improve the situation through this certain treatment program.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   So something like Alzheimer's, once you're diagnosed with Alzheimer's,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   it's something you have, and you're not going to get any--it's not expected to get better.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Now, that would be compared with falling and breaking your leg.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Well, that's considered to be an acute illness, and it's something that is going to get better.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   So when I say long-term care, I'm talking about ongoing what's called custodial care,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   care with the activities of daily living, care with bathing, dressing,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   help assistance with toileting, with transferring between a bed and a chair,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   those types of things, those are all considered to be activities of daily living.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   And if you spend some time--so that's custodial care.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   So when I talk about long-term care, I'm talking about ongoing custodial care,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   not, okay, you went into the hospital.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Your father is covered under the Veterans System and also under Medicare.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   So that's going to take care of some of the hospital benefits based upon what part Medicare is he in,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   does he have a supplement plan or not.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   That's all you should be familiar with that by this point.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   But the Veterans Administration provides limited long-term care services,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   but they do it based upon priorities.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   And so, as you should be familiar with by now, the veterans' benefits are divided into eight tiers,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   so tiers one through eight with some sub-tiers based upon whether or not a veteran has
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   a service-related disability, so a disability that was related to their service in the military.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   And so priority group one is veterans that have a service-related disability,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   that is 50% or more disabling, or veterans who were determined by the VA to be unemployable
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   due to service-related--service-connected conditions.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   So if you are extremely disabled because of some injury that you received while being in military service,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   then you're in priority group one.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   And in this situation, there's a very high chance that you will qualify for long-term care benefits
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   under the veteran system.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Priority group two would be veterans with service-connected disabilities rated 30% or 40% disabling.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   Priority group three, veterans with service-connected disabilities rated 10% or 20% disabling.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   Veterans who were former prisoners of war, veterans awarded the Purple Heart,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   veterans whose discharge was for a disability that began in the line of duty,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   veterans who were disabled because of VA treatment or participation in a VA vocational rehabilitation program,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   and it goes on down through the eight lists.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   And if you go down into groups six, seven, and eight, there's sub-priorities.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   So in group eight, for example, group eight--priority group eight,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   veterans who agree to pay a specified copayment with income and/or net worth above the VA means test threshold
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   and the geographic means test threshold.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Sub-priority A, non-compensable 0% service-connected veterans enrolled as of January blah, blah, blah.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   So there's all these sub-priorities.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Go Google it.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   You'll find it right on the Veterans Administration website, all this information.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   You want to find out what group your father is in and just see if there's any chance of getting benefits.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   I do not know how far down this list they are currently providing benefits.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   In the past, when I have researched it, it was only the first few,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   and basically as the costs have gone up and as the budgets have gotten more thin,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   the VA has had to cut back on benefits.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   So the best thing to do there is just become very close to the VA consultants that are at the VA
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   and see if there's some program that they know of.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Now one thing that would not necessarily be connected to that priority system would be what's called the aid
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   and attendance special pension.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   And so what this is is the special pension that will pay for additional amounts of money for a veteran
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   who is receiving care at home.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   So I will put a link in--I'll put a link in the show notes here.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   I'll put two links here, one from VeteranAid.org and the other from Benefits.VA.gov.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   And so the VeteranAid.org says, "Eligibility for the aid and attendance pension.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Any wartime veteran with 90 days of active duty, one day beginning or ending during a period of war,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   is eligible to apply for the aid and attendance improved pension.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   A surviving spouse, marriage must have ended due to death of a veteran or of a wartime veteran, may also apply.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   The individual applying must qualify both medically and financially.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   To see the periods of war that have been qualified by Congress, follow this link.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   To qualify medically, a wartime veteran or surviving spouse must need the assistance of another person
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   to perform daily tasks such as eating, dressing, undressing, taking care of the needs of nature, etc.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Being blind or in a nursing home for mental or physical incapacity
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   or residing in an assisted living facility also qualifies."
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And it goes on and talks about how to get eligibility.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   So this is an additional pension benefit that you may be eligible of in addition to the other monthly pension benefits.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   So you would want to research this.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   You need to be housebound.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   And so this might be an option where even at housebound with in-home care,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   if your father needs in-home care, this may be something where you may be eligible for an additional pension.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Now, depending on the income limits, you need to check out the income limits on this program
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   and you need to look at the eligibility limits.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   But this would be something that would be something to research and see if you would qualify or not.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   As far as any TRICARE benefits, TRICARE doesn't cover long-term care.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   Basically, that's the broad brush stroke because TRICARE is similar to health insurance.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   So let's just leave it there and not talk about any exceptions to any of that.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   So the next program, Medicare and Medicaid.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   So in broad strokes, Medicare will not provide any long-term care benefits.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   So now that I've said that, here's what they will provide.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Long-term care -- excuse me, Medicare will provide long-term care benefits if care is received in a nursing home following,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   I think it's a three-day hospital stay.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   And the way they do that is they will pay for the first 20 days of care that are needed in a nursing home after a hospital stay.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   They'll pay for the first 20 days each 100%.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   And then they will help pay for days 20 through 100 as long as you pay a daily copay.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   And I think the current daily copay rate is in the vicinity of about $150 a day.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   So if your father is getting out of the hospital and he goes into a nursing home,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   Medicare -- because he's in the hospital for a stroke, Medicare will pay for the first 20 days,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   and then for days 20 through 100, you'll pay $150 a day copay and Medicare will pick up the balance.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   After 100 days, there are no more Medicare benefits available.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   So in general, Medicare is not a solution for ongoing long-term care.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   That's why I say Medicare doesn't provide any long-term care benefits.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Now Medicaid, which is financial assistance for people for their health situations who are broken
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   and who don't have any money and don't have any assets, Medicaid will provide long-term care benefits.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   In general, Medicaid will provide long-term care benefits primarily in nursing homes.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Now there have been some changes in this situation over the last few years where Medicaid has been
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   testing various programs in different states to try to provide more in-home health care.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   And there's something that's -- this is a challenging area of government policy because when they try
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   to provide in-home health care, that's cheaper.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   It's cheaper for the -- it would be cheaper for the government to provide in-home health care
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   for many people more so than providing for facilities.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   So just go with nursing home versus in-home health care to simplify our example.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   It's cheaper to provide in-home health care.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Now the concern is that if those benefits are too generous, then what will happen is that because the
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   majority of people receiving care are currently doing it informally with no compensation,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   so this would be your mom caring for your dad at home, she's not going to get any compensation
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   for doing it informally.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   Because they're currently receiving care informally, if Medicaid starts paying for people to receive
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   in-home health care, the concern is that there's going to be caregivers coming from all over the place,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   coming out of the woodwork and saying, hey, pay us money or just pay for me to keep my family member
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   at home and that way I can do less of the physical work of the care and yet they can still be at home.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   So the concern is that if Medicaid starts paying for people to receive in-home health care,
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   they can still be at home.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   They actually call this the woodwork principle and it's a big deal in government policy to try to figure this out.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   Now Medicaid is a state-run program, so each individual state will have their own benefits.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   And again, various states are testing their programs.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   I don't know which state you live in.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   I live in Florida, so I'm somewhat familiar with Florida's Medicaid laws, but I'm not familiar with your state,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   and so I'm not going to make any comment about what your state will do.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   Just remember that as a big, broad brush stroke.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   In general, Medicaid will provide for care.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Most of the care they'll provide is for a nursing home.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   And this is kind of the constant challenge because very few people want their family members to be in a nursing home.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Most people would prefer their family members to be in the comfort of their own home where they're familiar with the
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   surroundings and they're comfortable and have the things that they value around them.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   However, there are very few government benefits available for that.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   So you want to make sure that you are aware of that.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   If you feel that Medicaid is going to be a solution, if you check out your services
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   and you check out the information on your state's Medicaid programs,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   you need to find out the qualification and how do you qualify it and what are the restrictions on qualifications.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   In order to qualify for Medicaid, you have to have income and assets under certain strict numbers,
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   and then you have to qualify medically.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   So you have to have income and assets under certain numbers.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   With each state, it's a little bit different.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   But in general, there are three different categories of assets.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   There are what are called countable assets, which are called non-exempt or available assets in some states.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   There are non-countable assets or exempt assets.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   And then there are inaccessible assets.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   And so the key is to look at your parents' asset mix and figure out which of their assets under your state's Medicaid laws
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   would be countable assets versus non-countable assets.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   So countable assets are any personal resources that are owned or controlled by an applicant for Medicaid benefits.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   So these must be spent on care before qualifying for Medicaid.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Usually this would include stocks, bonds, cash, investments, pension plans, annuities, a primary residence,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   life insurance, vacation properties, investment properties, basically any assets.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   With a primary residence, there's almost always an exception for a spouse.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   So we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   Then you have the non-countable assets, which would be a small amount of money, usually a few thousand bucks.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Primary residence, especially if there's a spouse that is surviving, a community-based spouse.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   Maybe some life insurance, some term life insurance, or some kind of business assets,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   and maybe an inexpensive car for personal use, and then various personal items.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   In general, Medicaid, you're going to have to get rid of all of your assets except for those non-countable assets.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   As far as the primary residence, there may be a state, a cap on an amount of value that's set by your state.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   It's usually either about a half a million or $750,000.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   So under this scenario, your dad's house would be fine.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   Then also there's usually exceptions for the spouse.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   The laws are generally written such that you're not going to be required to impoverish your mother in order to provide for your father.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   In general, that's going to be the situation.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   Again, there are exceptions.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   So check your state's Medicaid laws to see what your actual situation would be.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Then you're going to look at inaccessible assets.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Inaccessible assets would be anything that the government says this has to be provided for the care.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   So they're trying to -- maybe if this would be where you get into the situation where someone's trying to transfer assets to their children
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   or transfer assets to a friend, and then the Medicaid administrator looks at it and says,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   "Well, this is a fraudulent transfer.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Even though this asset isn't accessible to you, it has to be spent on your care before you're eligible for Medicaid."
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   There is now a five-year look-back period for Medicaid eligibility.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   So what that means is that on the date that you go to apply for Medicaid,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   there is a five-year look-back period under which the Medicaid administrator can technically undo any financial transactions that you have done
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   or count them towards your Medicaid bill.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   So, for example, if you have half a million dollars of cash and you transfer that to your son
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   and then you go and apply for Medicaid the next day, well, that transfer is going to --
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   you're going to have to spend that half a million dollars is going to have to be spent on your care
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   before Medicaid will provide you with the care that you need.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   So this is a much longer transfer period.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   So you would want to consider doing some Medicaid planning.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Now, in your situation, it's going to sound pretty simple, but once you research your state's Medicaid laws,
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   it might be worthwhile for you to just look at your parents' assets and prepare your father to qualify for Medicaid whether or not you choose to apply.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   And so knowing that there's going to be a five-year look-back period
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   and not knowing whether your father is going to live for 10 or 15 years,
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   if he has any assets that are going to disqualify him for that, then you may consider doing some Medicaid planning.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   And I'm going to basically quit with that and stop there just because it's so state law dependent.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   Now, you want to be careful with this because there may be other tax considerations.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   For example, maybe with their property -- so this would be where, as you're considering your plan,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   let's say that you mentioned your parents live out in the country and it's far away from you.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   That's probably not a place that's very conducive to your parents receiving care.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   It may be a lot better for your parents to receive care in a town where there can be a caregiver that's nearby that can come by and help out.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   So you're going to have some trouble.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   You're not probably going to want to consider selling that.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   But if all of a sudden you say, "Okay, we've got a non-accountable asset.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   We've got a privately owned residence here with a spouse that's living in it, and then we go and sell that asset,
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   and now we've got $100,000 sitting in a checking account.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Well, now we've changed a non-accountable asset into an accountable asset.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   And so now that $100,000 has to be spent on the cost of care before we can qualify for Medicaid."
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   So that would be something that you would want to be careful of.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   Now, you may want to sell that property and move to another property, or you may be able to arrange some other plan.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Like, there are many things that you can do, and again, without knowing the situation,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   I can't give you more information than this just to say this is how I would think through it.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   And I would encourage you to contact a qualified planner locally and have them help you to talk through some of these things.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   So consider Medicaid planning.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Consider just taking a look at what assets would need to be spent down.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   Consider doing this.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   The rules have tightened up significantly, so be suspicious of anything.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   So assume anything you hear or read about Medicaid planning is probably wrong until you check it out.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   Because in the past, there were many things that could be done.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   There were certain trusts that you could establish and you could transfer your assets into that.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   There were certain transfers of assets that you could accomplish, but all of those laws have been tightened up.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   It doesn't mean there's not something available.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   There are various planning tools available, and without -- it's already gone on much longer than I thought.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   So without going into the depths of Medicaid planning, I would just encourage you to consider just researching it,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   find some books on it, and consider speaking with an elder law attorney
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   and finding someone who is qualified with your state's information.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   So there are various tools that you could use.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   There are various things that you could look at, but I think that's enough for that.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   My next point and my last three points, and with this I'm done,
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   and I may have to cut off and not answer the next question.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   I've gone a lot longer on this than I intended to.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   So the next one would be look for and research any kind of community-based programs.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   So there's not going to be a magic bullet, at least that I've ever found, that's going to solve your financial problem.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   But there may be some local community programs that may be helpful to you.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   And so look for things like community programs such as Meals on Wheels.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   Those types of programs are usually community-based.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   They're often not a cost, and so that can help.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   So that can help relieve some of the burden.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Now you may have to go out and research those things.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   There are many programs out there, but you have to really take it on and just talk to everybody.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   So get in the habit of talking to everybody and saying, "Do you know of anything that you can help?"
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   And you'll find something there in whatever little local town is.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   You may find a program that's available that I don't have any concept of here in West Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   So look for any kind of community-based programs.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   Consider research to see if there are any adult daycare facilities.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   So this is another form of community-based care that can really be a blessing.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   And maybe there's something that's at a discounted cost, and this would allow --
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   an adult daycare facility is essentially an opportunity program that's set up where you can take your person --
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   where the person who's needing care can be cared for during the day in a community-based setting
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   so that the caregiver can go to work.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   So if your mom is working continually, then she would be able to continue working while someone else would care for her husband during the day,
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   and then she would have the care in the morning and at night.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   So consider that and research to see if there's something available.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Sometimes there are hospice benefits that are available.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   I know that when we were caring for my grandfather, the hospice organization was incredibly beneficial.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   And although they couldn't send a nurse out, they couldn't send a nurse out to help full-time and just do things.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   They could send a nurse out -- because of my grandfather's condition, they could send a nurse out for one or two times per week.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   And that's incredibly helpful because it provides what's called respite care,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   which is basically just to give the primary caregiver a respite, a break from the care.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   And so it was incredibly valuable to have an evening where my parents could get out of the house and have an evening off,
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   because that's the big thing, is that when you're primarily responsible, it's a 24-hour a day, 7-day-a-week care that's being provided.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   And so it's a blessing to be able to have a day off.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   Consider to see if there's some kind of inexpensive way that you can get some help.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   So instead of hiring a large home health care agency where you're going to negotiate a contract for 8 hours a day
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   and your monthly cost is going to be $5,000, that's not going to be feasible.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   But do some research to see if maybe there is a long-term care nurse that would like, on the side,
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   to come by for a little bit in the evening, for an hour on her way home, or come by in the morning for an hour on his way home,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   or on an hour on his way to work, or things like that, to care.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   And in exchange for a much smaller amount of money, they can provide a little bit of care, and that can be tremendously valuable.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   I know we negotiated that in my family, and it was an incredible blessing just to have somebody come by for a half hour,
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   an hour in the morning, and a half hour, an hour in the evening.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   And then it really made the physical needs of care a lot better and really made it a lot helpful.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   So look for some of these alternative strategies.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   Also, the other idea that I would have is in the example you described to me with your parents,
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   with your father being older and your mother being younger, consider to see and research to see if you could get some additional
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   Social Security income for her based upon filing for a spousal benefit and then deferring her own benefit.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   So perhaps she can file a spousal Social Security benefit, depending on her age.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   I think you have to be at least 62 years old.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   So she could file for her spousal benefits and receive a partial Social Security benefit while still continuing to accrue her own retirement benefit.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   And then she can defer her own retirement record up until the maximum latest age, hopefully at least until 70.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   So that will help her to be able to provide for herself down the road.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   It would be a major mistake for her to apply based upon the income scenario that you described to me.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   It would be a major mistake for her to apply at 62 to be able to -- at 62 for her retirement benefits.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   But if she could file on a spousal benefit on her husband and then continue to accrue her own benefits
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   and file on her own record at 70 with a much higher benefit after it's had the time to be the late benefit
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   and after she's had time to continue contributing to the system under her earnings, that might really make a big difference.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   Last thing is this.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   And I think I am going to stop with just this one question.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   And I apologize to -- I think it was Jason who had asked me the question on the 401(k).
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   I didn't mean to go on this long about this question, but this is a big passion of mine
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   and I want to provide this as a helpful resource.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   And the last thing I would say is this.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   It's very challenging when you're in the middle of a situation like this to figure out kind of what's next.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   And we don't know what's next.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   We don't know if your father is going to have another stroke and next month he's going to die
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   or we don't know if we're going to be caring for him for the next 10 years.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Nobody knows.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   So be flexible.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   But do whatever you can to try to make it the most amazing situation that you can.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   And one of the things that I've observed, and I see this happening a lot,
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   is if your mother is not working in a job that's conducive to providing care,
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   don't be scared to think outside of the box and find something radically different that's way more exciting,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   that's far more lucrative, and that helps her to have the ability to still provide care.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   There are so many options that are available.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   And the biggest thing that I've observed is that as people tend to age,
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   they tend to lose their flexibility of thinking and flexibility of change.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   And yet I could point to dozens and dozens and dozens of scenarios, and we all know them.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   The most famous is Colonel Sanders when he started Kentucky Fried Chicken when he was 65 years old.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   So the key is to really consider those same kind of fluffy things that I always talk about.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   What do you want?
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   Redefine yourself.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   Reinvigorate your life.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   Get additional education.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   Figure out what would my dream be.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   What new skills can I learn?
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   And transform your life.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   And I haven't been 65 years old, so I don't know what it's like to be 65,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   but I've seen enough people who have been there and watched them
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   and just seen how dramatically they changed their lifespan and changed their situation as time goes on.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   So I hope that you can spend some time with your mom really just talking about goal setting
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   and figuring out what's going to really serve the family well.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   And I hope that you guys, with a little bit of this information,
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   can develop a plan that is going to really help you to come through this in a really positive way,
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   and it can be a huge, huge benefit for you.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   I think that's it for today.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   And I didn't expect this show to go this way.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   If you've stuck with me through the end, again, even if just the one listener has listened,
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   then consider this a personal conversation and my best effort to give you some thoughts
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   that I hope will steer you in the right direction.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   And I'm thrilled to be able to do that.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   That's the advantage of podcasting, right?
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   I often have gotten frustrated listening to financial radio
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   and listening to someone give a four-minute answer to a question.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   And I know that you can't give a four-minute answer.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   And even I've spent, at this point, 59 minutes answering your question.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   And I think I've just given you some things to think about because I don't have an answer.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   And there is no answer except search it out and work on it.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   And I hope you can find a local advisor, someone who knows your situation.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   And I would encourage you, reach out to a local advisor,
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   because reach out to somebody that is competent in this area.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   Search for somebody.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   What I would do is I would look for somebody who is an elder law attorney and talk with them.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   Start with the library.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   Let me rephrase.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   Start with the library.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   In every local library, there's going to be some really good resources on this
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   in the public affairs section.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   And there's going to be some good books about it, and it will talk about your state's systems.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   Talk to every person that you're in contact with.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   So when you're at the hospital, ask them, "Do you know of anything?
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   Do you know of anything?
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   And do you know of any programs that are available?"
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   And you'll find out about a lot that way.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   Try to find maybe a local financial planner.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   Try to find a local person who specializes in long-term care planning.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   And so whether this is someone with a CLTC designation, they have a listing on their website.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   The Corporation for Long-Term Care can do that, and that will be a lot of insurance people,
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   a lot of investment people.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   I think some elder law attorneys, the man who founded that was an attorney,
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   and he's done a great job really trying to promote long-term care planning.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   Consider, again, reaching out to somebody in the local community, just asking people for help.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   And I know for me--I know that you may be short on money.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   I know for me I always try--I've always wanted to help people as much as I can
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   and at least point people in the right direction, so I would be happy to have a phone call with you.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   Just call a local advisor that you can find and just say,
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   "Do you know of anyone that specializes in this that might be able to help us?"
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   And even if you need to pay for an hour of somebody's time, that will be tremendously helpful to you.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   This is one of those situations where I can't give you an answer without knowing the whole situation,
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   but yet I'm too far away to ever be able to know the whole situation.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   So I think that's it for today.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   That's my Friday show.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   I want to leave--I'm going to take just a moment and hopefully to kind of send us out on a good note--
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   well, not a good note.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   This is really--this is why I have such a passion for financial planning,
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   because you can hear even in this is that I wish somehow--
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   my dream has been over the last years of doing financial planning,
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   my dream has been to help families do better planning sooner so that their later situations are much more joyful.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   And so this is not a depressing thing, even though it's just really challenging.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   I feel--I wish I could convey a better answer.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   I wish I had a solution.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   I wish I had a magic bullet, but I don't have one.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   I don't have an answer that's going to do better than that.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   But I didn't mean to imply that this was depressing.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   It's just a different type of show than my normal, "Hey, let's go get it" type of thing.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   I really love doing this, and I really feel passionately about that.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   So I've got a bunch of other articles.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   I think maybe Monday I will make this the article show of some articles I've collected this week that I wanted to talk through of some interesting ideas.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   Jason, I will save your question for next week about what do you do about a junkie 401(k),
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   and I could talk for an hour about that, but I will not do that today.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   So I apologize.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   I had told you I would put it on today, but I've just spent too much time on this already.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   I hope you've enjoyed this, and I hope that this weekend you are able to really consider some of the information that I've shared this week
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   and really make some progress towards your goals.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   Remember, you have to actually do something with it.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   It's good to learn, but now take it and create it.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   If you haven't created your family statement of financial condition, go do it.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   Create the balance sheet for yourself and figure out what it says, and take a look at your own situation.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   And I thank you for listening.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   This has been really fun for me.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   I have really enjoyed this week.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   Thank you for those of you who have continued to leave iTunes reviews.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   I have awesome news to report.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   I think if my answer is checked, we are in the new and noteworthy section for the investing section of iTunes.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   So thank you.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   That is one goal that I was really hoping would help to get the show some more attention, and I'm so thrilled that we're there.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   The next, I would love it if you would continue helping us out with those ratings and reviews and subscribing.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   And I would love to get into the new and noteworthy section for business.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   I'm not changing anything I'm doing based upon that, but it is nice.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   It's really encouraging just to be able to think of how many--to be able to help more people.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   It's really encouraging to have that as a possibility.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   And so thank you for those of you who have left some iTunes reviews.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   We have three new ones.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   Left Bite says, "Not the usual financial fodder.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   Joshua dives deep into interesting topics.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   Not the typical financial fodder we usually hear."
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   He gets me thinking.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   And also, "I was glad to hear a mention of finances with special needs kids in mind.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   I plan to do several shows on that and cover special needs planning in depth.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   It's very specialized and yet incredibly important, and there's some really great techniques that can be implemented."
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   So I will do that.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   It's not going to be for a little bit, but I will do that.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   Thank you for the review.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   Stay tuned and sign up for the e-mail newsletter where you'll get the show notes every day,
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   so that way you can see when those shows come out.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   Hands down my favorite podcast.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   Thank you, Quinn.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   And great information, but I love this game.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   Thank you for those five-star reviews.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   I really, really appreciate it.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   Remember, failure is an event.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   It's not a person.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Yesterday really did end last night.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   Today is the first day of the rest of your life.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   This weekend is the first weekend of the rest of your life.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   Go out and make it count.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   Spend time with people you love.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   Do work that matters.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   Don't let your finances get in the way of that.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   Rather, shape your finances so you can do that constantly.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   Have a great weekend, everybody.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   [Music]
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   I appreciate you listening.
