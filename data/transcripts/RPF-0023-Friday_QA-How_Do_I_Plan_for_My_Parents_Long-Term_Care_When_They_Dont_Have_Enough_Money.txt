[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.620]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 23.
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:44.880]   On today's show, how do I help my parents prepare for the prospect of needing long-term care services when they are not financially prepared?
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.940]   Also, what do I do about my 401k, which has high fees, limited options, and no clear fiduciary?
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:12.680]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast for today.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.760]   Today being Friday, July 18, 2014.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.220]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.480]   I'm your host here with you every day.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.920]   And today is going to be a Friday Q&A.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.040]   I'm going to be primarily handling two questions.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.500]   The two questions I just mentioned.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.920]   One about long-term care planning and the other about my 401k.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.380]   And then if we have time, we'll get to some inspiring reading for the weekend.
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:45.800]   So these two questions today are going to be challenging.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.240]   I don't expect them to be quick.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.720]   But I do want to really give some good ideas to the people that have asked the questions.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.800]   As you know, I'm a doctor.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.900]   I'm a doctor.
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.800]   I'm putting out these Friday Q&A shows every week,
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.060]   and I think that next Friday will be a lot better.
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.840]   So over the weekend, I should be able to get up
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.540]   and add the application on the website
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.960]   to allow you to phone in your feedback,
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.040]   so that way we can have a nice audio message
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.120]   that we can play on the air.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.460]   And I'm excited about that.
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.380]   It'll help us to get a better feel for you as a caller,
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.640]   as a questioner.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640]   It'll help us to get a little bit better of a feel
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.680]   and a little bit more personal
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.300]   instead of the more impersonal e-mails
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.960]   and Twitter questions and answers
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.420]   that I've been answering so far.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.600]   So I should be able to get that up over the weekend,
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.240]   over the early next week,
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.480]   and then I will announce it on the show
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.660]   as soon as that is ready to go.
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.260]   And then I hope that you'll call them in.
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.500]   But today we've got two questions
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.240]   that we're going to deal with,
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.120]   and then depending on how long the show goes,
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.300]   I've got a variety of articles
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.660]   that I'd like to talk about.
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.320]   If we get to them, if not, we'll push them to Monday.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.440]   And so those two questions are going to be
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.660]   a question about 401Ks
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.120]   and then a question about preparing for long-term care.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.360]   And I've struggled with which one to start with
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.120]   because neither of them are easy questions.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.400]   They're both pretty difficult.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.440]   They're pretty difficult for me to work through.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.460]   And I hope you'll see today
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.640]   kind of the real challenges of financial planning
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.380]   because these are both real people's situations.
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.360]   And I don't have enough information
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.560]   to really give a comprehensive, complete answer
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.400]   that's going to fully solve the listeners' questions.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.180]   But I'll try to give some ideas
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.700]   and point you in the right direction.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.540]   And I think we'll lead off with the long-term care question.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.480]   I think we'll start with that,
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.360]   and then we'll go into the 401K question
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.360]   after that.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.800]   And so the long-term care question
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.160]   comes in from a listener.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.440]   And this listener asked that I not share his name.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.140]   So we will keep this listener anonymous.
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.900]   And by the way, I'm always happy to do that.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.040]   I will generally try,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.040]   unless I goof up somewhere along the way
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.040]   and mention something.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.700]   The Twitter question coming in,
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.940]   I'll mention your Twitter handle.
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.420]   But if you send me an email with a question,
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.780]   I'll never read your name
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.040]   except just maybe your first name.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.500]   So feel free to lie about that
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.200]   if you don't want me to read that.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.240]   Or feel free to say,
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.340]   please leave my name out of it.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.400]   So this listener was writing into me
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.520]   about a challenging family circumstance.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.220]   And it involves long-term care.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.240]   And basically, I'll summarize the facts for you.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.540]   Again, I don't have complete facts,
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.720]   but I was able to figure out some of the information.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.920]   I'll summarize the facts for you.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.640]   This listener says,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.380]   you know, my dad just had a stroke.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.180]   And he's in the hospital.
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.160]   He's getting out of the hospital.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.620]   But he's not doing well.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.020]   And he's 81 years old.
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.140]   And his mom is about 20 years younger.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.200]   So I'm assuming 61.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.120]   61 years old, 62, somewhere in that range.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.960]   And evidently, his health has not been good
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.160]   for a good number of years.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.280]   He's actually been out of work for about 30 years
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.200]   due to some physical problems that he's faced.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.300]   And now he's just had a stroke.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.320]   And then the good thing about the stroke
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.320]   is that as part of being involved in the hospital
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.040]   and as part of being involved in the medical system,
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.140]   they diagnosed him as having
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.220]   some advanced degree of dementia,
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.020]   which really helped the listener
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.980]   to understand a little bit more
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.340]   about what was going on.
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.420]   His relationship with his father
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.100]   had been very challenging over the previous years.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.180]   And now he understands a little bit better,
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.560]   ah, it was probably due partly to the dementia.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.120]   And so that was really, in some ways,
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.180]   although it's not a pleasant diagnosis,
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.240]   in some ways, it's really helpful
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.660]   to at least understand that there's some chemical,
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.280]   there's some real chemical issue in the brain
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.420]   that would help to explain some of the off behavior.
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.400]   So, but the problem is, he said, what do we do?
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.800]   You know, we're not exactly sure what to do.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.380]   Mom and dad live alone.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.560]   They're together.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.020]   Each of them, they're together with each other,
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.160]   but they don't live with any family.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.420]   They're about an hour or so away from the son.
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.180]   So quite a ways, quite a ways away.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.320]   The son, he says, you know, the listener says,
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.440]   I'm not able to financially, due to my situation,
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.240]   I'm not able to make a large contribution.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.540]   And so I inquired about some of the numbers
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.200]   and he shared with me, you know, dad has,
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.300]   dad has about $800.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.400]   He has about $800.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.560]   $800 a month coming in and social security income.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.420]   Mom works and makes about $18,000 a year
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.400]   doing various things.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.980]   So if you add those numbers together,
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.980]   they give you an annual income of about $27,600.
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.180]   They have maybe about 5,000 bucks of savings
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.760]   and they have a paid off piece of property,
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.480]   about three acres of land out in the country,
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.680]   maybe worth about 50,000 bucks
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.100]   and then a mobile home on top of that
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.460]   that's, you know, falling into disrepair little by little.
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.140]   And so he's an only child and he says, you know,
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.240]   what do I do?
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.320]   My heart goes out to him because this is,
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.740]   long-term care planning is something
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.180]   that's near and dear to my heart.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.740]   And, you know, I may have shared on a previous episode,
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.480]   my grandfather had long, had dementia for,
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.720]   I think it was five or six years,
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.860]   somewhere about the age of about 90 to 95.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.180]   It's hard with dementia to always pinpoint,
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.620]   here's exactly the point where it, where it starts.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.720]   If any of you have worked through it
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.420]   with a family member, dementia or Alzheimer's,
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.000]   it's hard to point and say this was the day that it happened.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.040]   But about five years is my memory is correct.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.200]   And it's just a steadily,
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.080]   a steadily progressing disease
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.140]   where it just steadily gets worse and worse and worse.
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.780]   But it's so tough to see a loved one that you know,
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.480]   a loved one that you know and love going down
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.860]   and you don't have any hope that they're going to get better.
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.340]   And it's especially tough to deal with as a disease
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.820]   because it doesn't necessarily affect the body.
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.220]   It doesn't necessarily affect the physical health
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.340]   of the person who has the disease.
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.040]   So my grandfather, for example,
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.060]   he retired when he was in his mid to late 80s.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.220]   I think I get my dates confused just about every time.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.000]   He was 84, I think is when he retired, something like that.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.620]   But he was, he was hardy and healthy
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.680]   and full of vigor and full of life.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.720]   Retirement kind of did him in a little bit.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.320]   Once he retired and actually sat down,
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.520]   he started to get old quickly.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.840]   But then he started to face dementia.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.560]   And in working with dementia,
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.560]   I learned a lot kind of going through it as a young man,
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.120]   trying to work and help my parents out.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.740]   And it's really challenging.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.600]   And one of the biggest challenges of dementia
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.000]   is that it doesn't affect you.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.300]   It doesn't affect you physically.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.820]   So you don't, unlike some diseases
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.780]   where you maybe have a diagnosis of cancer
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.820]   and the physician may be able to estimate,
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.160]   well, this is your life expectancy.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.360]   Or some other diseases where you can say,
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.980]   well, this isn't necessarily expected
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.260]   to affect your life expectancy.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.480]   With dementia, it doesn't affect your physical health.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.680]   It affects your mental health.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.140]   So you may be healthy as anything.
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.220]   And so it's very unknown as far as how to plan for it.
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.100]   But yet it's extremely challenging
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.980]   and extremely draining to work through
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.280]   that from a care perspective.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.120]   And so my heart went out to this listener.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.260]   And since I heard of his situation,
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.420]   I've just been thinking about the question
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.240]   and thinking about the question,
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.300]   trying to figure out what the answer is.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.880]   And it's tough because in some ways there is no answer.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.540]   And I'll try to do better than that.
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.520]   I'll try to give some ideas.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.960]   But in some ways there is no answer.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.080]   And I'm going to say some things.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.440]   And I know the listener is listening.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.120]   And I just want to say,
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.680]   my heart is filled with compassion and empathy.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.480]   And I wish that I had some good answers for you.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.580]   I don't know of any good financial answer for the situation
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.900]   because there's not a lot to work with.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:59.720]   And I'll give you ideas.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.100]   I've got some ideas of some programs for you to research
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.820]   and just kind of walk you through how I would approach it.
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.980]   But at the end of the day, I don't have a good answer.
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.380]   But I want to bring a situation like this forward
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.840]   to encourage the rest of you
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.600]   to consider doing some planning up front.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.720]   Because if you'll do some planning in advance
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.540]   for these things,
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.560]   it's not going to make them emotionally easier.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.240]   But it may make them a little bit easier
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.420]   if there's some plans in place already.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.800]   And this is essentially how I think about financial planning.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.320]   I don't understand why people don't want to do financial planning.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.660]   This has been one of those circuits in my head
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.180]   that has never made sense to me.
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.220]   Because I guess I always joke about,
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:42.980]   well, you're going to die.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.060]   So make sure you die with a will and force.
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.800]   Chances are this could happen.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.020]   And for some reason, that's never bothered me.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.360]   But I know it's not going to happen.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.700]   I know it really bothers some people
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.860]   to think about this planning.
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.180]   But I tell you, when you see somebody
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.480]   go through a tough situation,
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.600]   it really helps you to say,
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.520]   well, I've got to do some planning.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.700]   And you've got to do what you can when you can.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.800]   I don't think necessarily financial planning
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.840]   is the magic cure that's going to fix everything.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   Not everybody is poor and broke
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:13.240]   because there's something somehow wrong with them morally
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.160]   or that they're just somehow not smart.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.200]   That's not the case at all.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.240]   There is bad luck that happens.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.240]   There are situations that are beyond people's control.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.060]   People get beat down.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.860]   There are things that can happen.
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.720]   And that's across the board,
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.380]   that things can happen to all of us.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.080]   And so I don't think there's any amount of planning
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.520]   that can guarantee anything.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.920]   But I do believe that no matter the situation,
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.680]   a little bit of planning and some ideas
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.020]   can make the situation better.
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.040]   We see this all the time in our culture.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.320]   That's why there are stories that are constantly written
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.600]   about somebody who is sick.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.700]   And look at how even though they were sick
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.900]   or even though they were an amputee,
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.000]   they still ran the marathon.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.520]   I mean, bad luck can, if you're a soldier,
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.580]   bad luck, you walk over a bomb or an IED or a claymore
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.920]   or whatever they're called nowadays.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.400]   You walk over a bomb and your legs are gone.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.200]   That's bad luck.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.360]   But once it's done, it's done.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.380]   You got to make the best of it.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.000]   So that's kind of how I think about financial planning.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.700]   So I'm going to do my best to give this listener some ideas,
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.720]   some very practical ideas, some programs to research,
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.300]   but also some big picture ideas.
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.720]   But none of this is intended to be cruel.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.860]   And it's a little hard when it's impersonal
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.980]   where maybe you can't do it.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.360]   I can't sense my empathy or my compassion,
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.800]   but I want to give you some answers.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.420]   But I also want to use it as a learning experience.
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.900]   First thing, this situation, the listener being an only child
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.520]   and having ailing, aging parents,
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.120]   and then this listener not being able to help his parents very much,
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.020]   this is the situation that we face generationally in this country.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.360]   And right now, it's especially prominent.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.640]   The term that goes forward is the sandwich generation.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.940]   And I don't know if this listener has children or not,
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.140]   but it really doesn't matter.
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:49.960]   But especially...
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.120]   Well, it's especially more difficult with children.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.160]   But what happens is that there are millions and millions of us
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.780]   throughout the country who are now finding ourselves in this position
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.400]   or who will find ourselves in the position in the future
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:07.060]   who will find ourselves in the position of needing to care for our aging parents
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.420]   and of caring for our own children at the same time.
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.360]   And this is incredibly challenging and incredibly stressful.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.700]   And there are some demographic changes that have made this very challenging.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.940]   And it comes down to the small number of children
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.940]   and the dispersion of families
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.200]   and the adjustments and changes in lifestyle.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.180]   Now, I'm not going to make some values judgments on these things.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.260]   You do what you want with them.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.000]   But these are demographic realities,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.840]   and they're facing all of us, which leads to the need for planning.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.140]   But, you know, and I'm going to draw some generalizations.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.660]   I recognize the generalizations,
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.840]   and they may not apply in every case.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.360]   But I think it's important to understand and to think about
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.920]   because this question does not need only a financial...
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.480]   a financial answer.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.180]   In the past, traditionally,
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.520]   how have we cared for our elderly and aged parents?
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.580]   Well, normally, in the past, traditionally,
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.500]   the family unit was a lot tighter, a lot bigger,
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.940]   and a lot closer together.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.920]   So in the past, we've had a society...
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.860]   And again, I recognize I'm idealizing a little bit,
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.160]   but I still think it's valid to do so in this situation
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.400]   to draw the lesson.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.960]   In the past, we've had a society
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.000]   where the family units were much closer together.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.900]   So we look at...
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.640]   We look at the Norman Rockwell painting
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.840]   of traditional U.S. America,
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.360]   and we see the family sitting down for dinner every day.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.620]   Does that happen all the time? No.
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.380]   Were their families broken apart? Yes.
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.420]   But more than there is now,
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.680]   the family unit was in many ways much tighter,
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.120]   much closer relationship.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.780]   There was a much larger family unit,
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.740]   and the work among the family unit
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.060]   was generally more integrated.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.060]   So in an agrarian society,
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.120]   it would be very normal that children would grow up
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.840]   working with their parents every day,
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.800]   working with their parents,
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.080]   spending time with their parents,
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.840]   helping in the family enterprise.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.840]   Traditionally, in the traditional view,
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.380]   this would be an agrarian enterprise, a farm.
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.460]   So on a farm, the children are working with the parents every day
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.800]   and really building this close-knit family.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.380]   And then it would be unusual for the children
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.780]   to grow up and move very far away.
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.840]   Traditionally, in agrarian societies,
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.120]   generally, people will live somewhat close
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.360]   to where they were born and where they were from.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.800]   And usually, you would have a high number of children,
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.820]   a much higher number of children than we have now.
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.440]   So maybe an average of five to six to seven to eight children,
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.100]   depending on what part of the world that you're in.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.780]   Well, if you fast-forward to today
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.860]   and look at how different our lifestyles are...
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.980]   Okay, so before I go there,
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.680]   then the parents, as the parents age,
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.880]   traditionally, a farmer would never retire.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.940]   You know, I have a grandfather who was a farmer,
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.220]   the other grandfather, not the one who had dementia,
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.580]   although he also was a farmer-rancher earlier in his life.
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.280]   But I have a grandfather who was a farmer,
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.100]   and he never retired.
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.480]   He died at 93 years old,
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.600]   and he never retired.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.000]   Now, he had to pull back.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.840]   At the end of his life,
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.240]   he wasn't really able to go to the farm,
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.160]   but he was still working on paperwork.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.860]   And so traditionally, as you aged,
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.300]   you were still part of the family,
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.340]   still part of the community,
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.920]   and you just simply took over some of the easier jobs
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.100]   that were less physically taxing.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.320]   But you were still part and still very engaged.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.660]   So I think people, because they felt engaged
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.140]   as part of society, in my opinion,
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.320]   I think people aged a little bit more gracefully,
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.060]   and the family was able to help.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.700]   So if all of the work is centered
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:19.820]   around the family,
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.900]   and you have the farmhouse,
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.280]   you have the fields and everything relatively nearby,
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.540]   and if all of the work is centered on the home,
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.600]   you're always going to have many people there working.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.040]   It's much simpler to have caretakers around
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.060]   to care for the aging parents.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.880]   And so this makes,
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.120]   traditionally, people have cared for their parents themselves.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.080]   They've been able to produce and be productive,
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.480]   even though they're not necessarily earning an income.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.580]   A grandparent can care for a grandchild much more easily.
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.460]   A grandparent can still help out
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.800]   with certain things,
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.960]   less physically demanding tasks.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.160]   And so this is kind of the historical view.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.620]   Well, fast forward, and there's been this dramatic shift
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.840]   over a couple of generations.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.060]   And the dramatic shift has encompassed a few things.
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.200]   Number one, instead of an agrarian society,
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.500]   you have an industrialized society.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.360]   So instead of home-based employment,
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.860]   where the family unit is working together,
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.780]   we have out-of-the-home-based employment,
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.320]   where the family unit is split.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.780]   And traditionally, okay, the male in this country
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.660]   may have been out of the house,
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.920]   and now it's more normal that both parents are out of the house.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.780]   So this leads to a much more fragmented
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.200]   family.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.060]   This leads to less time with the parents,
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.380]   spending time with the children.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.080]   This leads to the need to hire people
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.140]   for the raising of children,
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.600]   which is where you have the public education system comes in.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.740]   And whether it's aspects of education,
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.120]   which is usually how it's thought of,
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.040]   or whether it's aspects of child care,
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.820]   which I believe there's, if you go and study it,
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.800]   there would be some evidence to say
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.760]   that that wasn't necessarily ignored
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.160]   when the system was established in the way it is,
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.880]   is that to make the transition to an industrialized society
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.640]   and to incorporate both workers
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.680]   into the workforce
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.240]   so that you can reduce the cost of the workers
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.300]   by increasing the supply of labor,
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.360]   go research it.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.420]   I'm not convinced of it,
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.880]   but certainly there is literature
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.360]   that would indicate that people
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.180]   were not surprised by that development.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.680]   Then if you were to go and research this,
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.900]   you would find that we need something
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.340]   to care for the children.
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.480]   So therefore you have school
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.400]   that happens during work hours,
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.400]   and this provides for the child care.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.620]   Well, this leads to a more fragmented
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.320]   family where children and parents
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.940]   have a less intimate relationship
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.680]   with each other.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.320]   They're maybe very busy,
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.680]   less together.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.000]   We're not working on a common family enterprise,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.120]   but we're each working on our own enterprises.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.580]   Father and mother each have their own jobs.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.400]   Children are encouraged to have their own jobs,
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.280]   and it's unusual if you find a family
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.140]   that's working together.
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.420]   And then this leads to a geographic dispersion.
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.140]   So with the increase in monetary wealth,
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.340]   with the pool of jobs,
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.580]   it's very abnormal for people to stay close
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.560]   to where they are at home,
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.900]   and with the reduction of the number of children,
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.440]   you have a dramatic change
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.780]   where now you have one or two children.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.220]   You have one child, in the case of this author,
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.100]   and this child has two parents
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.420]   instead of five children and two parents.
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.080]   And so you have this dramatic generational change.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.220]   So two children, two parents,
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.200]   one child, two parents.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.160]   And then when you take that into a spouse
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.280]   and you say, okay, we have a male spouse
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.100]   who has his parents,
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.060]   and a female spouse has her parents,
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.960]   and maybe there's one or two siblings among them,
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.380]   now we wind up in a situation
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.760]   where we may have four parents
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.500]   and two children to care for the four parents,
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.020]   or two, three, four children,
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.060]   I mean, depending on the numbers.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.000]   And then in an age of changing family dynamics,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.340]   it's more likely that it's possible
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.280]   that the parents are divorced
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.840]   and now we have parents and step-parents,
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.700]   and now you're in a situation where
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.940]   instead of it just being one couple
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.520]   with a total of four parents,
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.060]   there's all the other step-parents involved.
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.640]   And so it changes the dynamic.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.320]   And this is the reality that's facing
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.600]   the social security system
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.960]   of the reduced number of workers
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.100]   that are working based upon
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.280]   the increased number of retirees.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.900]   This is the challenge that's facing us
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.080]   demographically in this country.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.440]   Well, it hits close to home
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.680]   when it comes to long-term care
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.840]   because that means that all of the responsibility
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.460]   for the care of the parents,
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.280]   should the child choose to assume
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.700]   that responsibility as a child,
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.420]   is placed upon one or two children.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.620]   This can be very challenging.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.060]   So with these demographic changes,
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:19.520]   it leads to a lot of change.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.580]   It leads to a difficult situation.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.720]   And I point it out
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.040]   because it leads to a need
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.960]   for a whole new area of planning.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.640]   And it's simply,
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.460]   how do we care for ourselves as we age?
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.440]   In the past, it was simple.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:32.980]   Family.
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:33.940]   That was the answer,
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.480]   is that the family will care for me
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.320]   so there's no problem.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.500]   The family had the capacity.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.500]   But how on earth do you have the capacity nowadays?
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.660]   How on earth do you have the capacity
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.900]   if you have children that are working,
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.480]   financially challenged,
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.420]   not able to necessarily
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.720]   do extremely well economically for them
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.640]   and now they are faced with the challenge
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.820]   of supporting and being responsible for their parents
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.680]   as their parents need to care as they get older.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.600]   So then that leads to the natural growth
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.320]   of the government programs that are in place.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.860]   That leads to those government programs
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.160]   being overly taxed,
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.260]   which is what has happened
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.880]   with the government programs for care.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.580]   One of the things that I have observed
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.160]   in paying attention to it
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.060]   is that while the expansion
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.920]   of traditional health insurance benefits
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.960]   has been steady,
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.280]   over time,
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.320]   where those programs have been,
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.500]   the government has little by little
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.760]   increasingly picked up
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.100]   the expansion of those,
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.020]   expanded their care
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.860]   up to and including the Affordable Care Act
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.420]   and the changes that that has brought
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.660]   in the health insurance marketplace.
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.320]   It has been the exact,
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:38.900]   the quietly,
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.820]   over the last couple of decades,
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.180]   it has been the exact opposite
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.040]   in the areas of long-term care.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.900]   And long-term care meaning ongoing custodial care
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.280]   for not for a critical illness,
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.440]   it's expected to get better,
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.180]   but ongoing custodial care
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.900]   for something that's not expected to get better.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.740]   And so if you go back
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.220]   and you trace the history of the tax law,
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.860]   I won't do that today in a Q&A show,
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.800]   but if you go back and trace the history,
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.620]   little by little benefits have been removed
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.900]   consistently and steadily.
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.300]   Even to the point of one of the things
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.300]   that got very little news,
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.080]   except among the professional advisor community,
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.860]   was there was a component of the Affordable Care Act
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.220]   called the CLASS Act.
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.800]   And I think that CLASS,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.900]   if my memory is correct,
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.360]   stood for Community Living Assistance
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.200]   something or other,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.220]   something like that,
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.920]   Community Living Assistance Program.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.820]   And it was basically a federally organized version
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.140]   of long-term care insurance.
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.160]   Well, the program was such a disaster,
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.020]   actuarially speaking,
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.560]   and everyone knew it was,
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.540]   and everyone said it was,
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.180]   that it was just quietly eliminated about,
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.780]   I think it was a year or so after it was passed,
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.720]   maybe a couple of years.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.320]   The dates are fuzzy in my mind.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.380]   So the benefits that are available,
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.580]   the government benefits facing this demographic problem,
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.040]   the government benefits have been steadily reduced,
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.920]   have been steadily drawn back,
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.900]   because there's no money available to pay for them.
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:55.240]   And so this is a big, big area of planning
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.100]   that we need to pay attention to,
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.600]   especially as we're responsible for guiding people.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.440]   I'm not going to go deep into long-term care plan today,
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.060]   but I'll tell you the one that ticks me off
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.820]   is when people put an age in for long-term care.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.300]   Well, you should start planning for long-term care at age 60.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.240]   Guess what?
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.620]   You should start planning for long-term care
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.460]   as soon as you're around,
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.940]   but you need to figure out
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.000]   where you're going to be.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.760]   You need to figure out where it comes in
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.320]   in your terms of financial priorities.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.440]   And I'll cover that another time.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.500]   But if you can ever prove to me,
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.380]   this one drives me nuts,
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.600]   if you can ever prove to me an age
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.800]   where all of a sudden it makes sense
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.840]   to plan for long-term care that age
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.900]   and it didn't before that and it doesn't after that,
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.200]   it's absolutely ridiculous to put an age on this.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.460]   Plan for it when you can,
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.340]   and I promise we'll do extensive in-depth planning shows
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.660]   on long-term care.
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.000]   So we need to do planning,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.700]   and this is going to be a very challenging situation
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.420]   for this listener.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:49.800]   I don't know how challenging.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.300]   You know, the listener's father may have,
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.620]   may be able,
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.080]   may be in excellent shape
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.240]   after he comes out of the hospital
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.780]   and may be able to care for himself.
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.600]   But then again,
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.440]   he may need full-time care on an ongoing basis.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.980]   And so it's impossible for obviously me to know,
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.380]   and I've just had an email
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.740]   that I'm answering publicly here.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:12.660]   But I hope that I can have some thoughts and some ideas.
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.240]   So where I want to start with this
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.100]   is anytime you're starting with long-term care planning,
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.740]   start with the non-financial stuff.
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.660]   Don't start with the numbers
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.380]   because no matter what the numbers are,
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.140]   you start with the non-financial stuff.
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.820]   And the biggest misconception about long-term care
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.700]   is that it's a financial planning situation.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.960]   It is, and you can do some things with financial planning.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.700]   But I say start with non-financial.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.500]   And in this situation,
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.420]   I want to speak directly to this listener,
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.240]   you need to do some careful thinking and research
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.700]   on the impact that care has on your life.
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:48.720]   I want to speak directly to this listener,
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:48.760]   I want to speak directly to this listener,
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:48.860]   and I want to speak directly to this listener,
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:48.900]   and I want to speak directly to this listener,
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.300]   and caregiving has on family.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.420]   It can be an incredible blessing
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.920]   to care for your aging parents.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.760]   I consider myself very fortunate
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.980]   to have been able to serve and to honor and to love
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.720]   my grandparents as they aged.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.320]   What a way to give back
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.160]   for those who have cared for you and provided for you.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.820]   And my parents are in excellent health,
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.740]   but I am,
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.800]   should the opportunity arise to care for them,
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.100]   I will consider it an honor and a blessing
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.160]   to be able to serve them
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:18.600]   and a way to help them.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.560]   It's a way to honor our parents.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.060]   So it is an incredible blessing.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.840]   It's also an incredible challenge.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.660]   And I want to read you some statistics here.
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.160]   And these statistics I'm pulling from,
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.160]   this is a little bit old,
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.320]   a 2004 National Alliance for Caregiving survey.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.160]   And there are a few different sources
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.580]   of this list of statistics that I'm going to read,
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.460]   but I think they hold valid.
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.540]   So first of all,
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.420]   the majority of care that is provided
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.420]   for people who are chronically ill
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.760]   is provided by informal caregivers.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.280]   And informal caregivers simply means family members,
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.200]   unpaid caregivers.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.340]   So this would be you caring for your parents
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.440]   and providing the physical daily care that they need.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.380]   Many children are going to be expected
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.820]   to care for their parents.
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.080]   And the challenge is that
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.580]   caring for the chronically ill parent
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.980]   often makes the caregiver chronically ill.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.400]   And this is an incredible challenge
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.360]   that most people just simply aren't familiar with.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.520]   But I guarantee if you've been involved
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.960]   in the care of a parent or grandparent,
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.560]   you're nodding your head with me right now,
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.420]   is that it is a tremendous challenge
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.160]   and a tremendous burden on the family.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.980]   It can be a joyful burden and an honor,
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.180]   like I said, but it's a burden.
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.380]   There's about 45 million informal caregivers
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.280]   in the United States,
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.820]   21% of the adult population.
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.040]   So in 21% of households,
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.320]   there's an informal caregiver.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.000]   40% of the caregivers are women.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.500]   40% are men.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.920]   Women still account for most of the caregiving hours per week,
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.260]   about 71%.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.840]   Although it is estimated that the percentages of men
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.900]   giving care will increase substantially
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.940]   because future families will have fewer children.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.860]   The median age of informal caregivers is 45 years old.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.540]   62% of informal caregivers are married.
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.000]   41% have children under 18 at home.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.480]   Informal caregivers contribute on an average
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.600]   $200 out of their own pockets per month
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.620]   to subsidize care.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.400]   Such as simply contributing money out of pocket
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.560]   to pay for people to give them relief from the care.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.320]   67% reported providing care
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.660]   between 8 and 20 hours per week.
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.060]   On average, an informal caregiver
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.700]   provides care for four and a half years.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.840]   Informal caregivers provided services
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.260]   that if they had been provided formally
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.620]   would have cost around $350 billion,
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.940]   about the same as Medicare's total spending.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.440]   22% of informal caregivers to the elderly
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.420]   are depressed.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.760]   Around twice the rate in the population as a whole.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:56.320]   55% of caregivers living with dementia patients
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.560]   suffer clinical depression.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.720]   I'm going to repeat that.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.100]   55% of caregivers living with dementia patients
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.140]   suffer clinical depression.
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.680]   It is incredibly challenging to care for somebody
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.300]   with dementia on an ongoing basis.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.320]   And you need to be very, very careful.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.200]   Very, very careful to make sure
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.820]   that you are providing the support
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.740]   for the caregiver.
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.140]   An elderly informal caregiver
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.900]   has a significant risk of death
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.780]   as a result of his or her sick spouse's hospitalization.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.160]   The risk to spouses was highest
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.180]   when the hospitalization was for a chronic
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.900]   disabling illness like dementia.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:35.820]   Quote,
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.520]   What this shows is that people are interconnected
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.380]   and their health is interconnected.
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.580]   And seeing a person that you love suffer,
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.600]   seeing them ill harms you,
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.120]   said study co-author Dr. Nicholas Christakis
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:47.900]   of the
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:48.800]   Harvard Medical School.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.240]   Elderly informal caregivers
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.620]   run a 63% higher risk of dying
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.200]   from stress-related illnesses.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.560]   Informal caregivers
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.560]   who responded that their health
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.900]   has gotten worse as a result of caregiving
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.720]   most commonly report
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.680]   a loss of energy and sleep,
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.300]   87%.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.360]   Stress or panic attacks,
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.780]   70%.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.160]   Aches or pain, 60%.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.300]   Depression, 52%.
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.800]   Headaches, 41%.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.440]   And weight gain or loss, 38%.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.940]   In addition, they tend to spend less time
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.140]   with family or friends, 69%.
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.800]   And at work, 37%.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.200]   Abuse of the elderly
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.300]   by family members has risen significantly.
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.520]   73% of caregivers
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.240]   listed prayer as the best way to cope
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.320]   with the stress and sadness of providing care.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.600]   Alzheimer's disease
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.960]   is a major cause
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.180]   of the need for long-term care.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.240]   One in eight people 65 and older
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.400]   have the mind-destroying illness.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.860]   Half of all people
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.480]   over 85 are affected.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.800]   10 million Americans
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.660]   are currently caring for a person
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.880]   with Alzheimer's disease
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.720]   and tend to be stressed to the breaking point
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.100]   financially, emotionally,
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.380]   and physically.
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.860]   The challenge is about distance
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.900]   between, the challenge is about
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.140]   distance from parents.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.760]   This is a study from MetLife.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.640]   15% of caregivers
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.780]   leave at least one hour away from their parents.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.380]   33% provide
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.620]   care at least once a week.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.440]   Respondents estimated that care
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.860]   and travel amounted to one full workday per week.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.940]   23% reported that they were
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.800]   the only caregivers their parents had.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.060]   Nearly 50% stated they spent
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.060]   an additional 3.4 to 4 hours
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.960]   per week arranging or monitoring care.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.140]   40% reported
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.460]   providing direct assistance
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.880]   with the most difficult activities of daily living.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.880]   Caregivers reported spending
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.300]   an average of $199 per month
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.880]   on travel, in addition
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.360]   to the $200 per month
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.000]   they spend to help their parents.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.820]   And so one quote,
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.300]   one quote here from this book
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.580]   that I'm referencing here
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.820]   is a quote out of a PBS documentary
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.440]   entitled, And Thou Shalt Honored.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.840]   And one woman, when being interviewed,
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.280]   replied, quote,
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.620]   When I got married, I never really understood
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.800]   the vow in sickness and in health.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.080]   Now I do.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.780]   His sickness, my health.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.700]   For it to be easy for me,
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.460]   it would have to be over for my husband.
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.820]   That's unacceptable.
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.480]   I often wonder,
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.740]   will there be anything left of me
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.980]   when he passes away?
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.100]   Will there be anything left for me?
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:32.280]   It's probably a good place to stop.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.200]   So I take a moment just to read those statistics
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.960]   because I had seen prior to my learning
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.880]   those statistics, and I learned that years ago.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.980]   I was reading those statistics
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.460]   from a manual
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:44.940]   that I had,
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.060]   a financial planning manual
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.320]   for a certificate.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.760]   I got years ago called
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.480]   the Certification in Long-Term Care Planning.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.340]   And when I read those statistics,
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.080]   it was the first designation
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.220]   that I went out and pursued
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.580]   after becoming a financial planner
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.040]   because of my experience with it
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.920]   and also because it was kind of
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.260]   an easier designation to get.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.480]   And when I read those statistics,
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.360]   I was just stunned.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.740]   I had never had any idea.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.580]   And that was, again,
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.400]   those are a little bit dated.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.700]   I'm sure they're even more significant now.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:15.000]   So I point them out to you
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.260]   just to be aware of them
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:16.880]   because,
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.580]   this makes a big difference.
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.180]   Now, if you're aware of something,
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.720]   you can put plans in place
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.200]   to avoid the major problems.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.300]   So, for example,
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.820]   if you're aware of the fact that
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:31.820]   a tremendous percentage of parents,
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.060]   I forget the statistics.
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.920]   I'll have to check them some other time.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.780]   But if you're aware of the fact
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.480]   that there is a tremendously high divorce rate
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.940]   among parents
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.640]   who have either lost a child to death
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.820]   or who are dealing with a child who's disabled,
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.280]   then if you lose a child
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.660]   to death or you have a child who's disabled,
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.680]   you can plan for that.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.680]   And you can recognize,
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.140]   my marriage is in danger.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.140]   I need to take extra special steps for this.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.680]   Or if you're aware of the fact
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.620]   that the majority of lottery winners
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.520]   become broke or bankrupt
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.940]   soon after winning their lotteries,
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.160]   then if you win the lottery,
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.060]   then you can make plans
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:07.860]   and you can say,
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.380]   wait, I need some careful and special.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.500]   This doesn't have to happen,
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.460]   but I need to do something very carefully
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.260]   to make sure that I avoid it.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:47.240]   And I need to make sure that I avoid it.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:47.880]   So I need to make plans in place
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.540]   to deal with that as best you can.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.320]   It's going to be financial stress.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.600]   Again, the average is $200 a month
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.220]   of contributions to pay a caregiver
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.700]   to give your parents some sort of extra help,
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.440]   plus $200 a month of living expenses,
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.300]   excuse me, of travel expenses,
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.360]   just to get there.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.340]   And you can understand,
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.280]   if you live an hour away from your parents
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.600]   and you're going to travel there for one hour a week,
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.600]   excuse me, at least a day or two a week,
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.660]   that's going to bring a tremendous financial burden
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.900]   just on gasoline and wear and tear on a vehicle.
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.440]   So we need to make some plans
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:25.100]   that are going to help to improve this.
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.340]   Now, unfortunately, I don't have any good plans
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.200]   because you've got to look at the actual situation.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.280]   You've got to say, well, what do my parents need?
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.960]   What do they have?
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.620]   Is there a way that we could somehow live together
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.820]   to diminish costs?
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.180]   Now, that may or may not be possible
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.180]   depending on the situation.
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.240]   Is there a way that I can contribute financially?
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.200]   Is there a way that...
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.380]   You know, you've got to find a plan.
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.160]   And I'm going to talk through some of the benefits
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.740]   that you need to research to see what's available to you
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.780]   as far as for extra help.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.140]   But the big thing is not going to be any kind of benefits
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.460]   because, frankly, there are none.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.180]   And I say that as a blanket statement.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.380]   There are a few, but there's generally not much.
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.320]   And this is because it's an epidemic
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.820]   that we're facing in the country.
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.820]   And unless you've done prior planning,
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.320]   and unless you've saved money for this situation,
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.740]   unless you have money to pay for a caregiver,
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.840]   a formal caregiver,
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:20.300]   or unless you have something like a long-term care insurance policy
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.060]   that can fund it,
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:25.620]   then there's not a financial solution.
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:26.540]   There's not.
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.440]   You have to commit to providing the care
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.820]   and figuring it out as you go.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.180]   Now, you shouldn't feel bad about not planning
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.800]   because the reality is that if you had started five years ago
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.620]   with this planning and you were sitting in my office
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.180]   and we said, okay, if your dad and mom were sitting there
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:42.500]   and your dad is 75 years old,
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.620]   and then considering some of the other health problems
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:45.460]   that you shared with me,
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.160]   I would have said,
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.120]   there's nothing you can do.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:48.740]   It's too late.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.580]   It's too late.
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.480]   After those health problems,
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.040]   after you have certain health problems,
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.860]   you can't buy insurance,
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.040]   and you don't have the money,
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:57.700]   and you're not working.
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.040]   So don't beat yourself up about not doing the planning in the past.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.280]   Just recognize that it's going to be very much
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.460]   a non-financial answer,
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.380]   not so much a financial answer.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:12.140]   So continuing on.
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:12.360]   Okay.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.940]   I've got to pick up the pace here.
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.380]   So what do you need to do?
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:15.840]   Well, first of all,
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.100]   you need to spend a lot of time researching.
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:20.940]   There is no one place that I can send you to
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.120]   to say, here's the information.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.140]   I'm going to give you some ideas
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.400]   of some things that I think you need to research
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.320]   and some programs to investigate
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.900]   and a broad brush stroke of how they work to see,
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.220]   to see what may or may not be available to you.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.740]   But the key is you've got to become a researching hound
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.600]   to find the information that you need.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.720]   It's not served up to you on a platter
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.320]   anywhere that I've ever been able to find.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.260]   First of all,
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.120]   you said that your father was a Korean-American.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.300]   This is good.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:48.700]   Okay.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.900]   Because there may be some veteran benefits,
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.200]   although it's usually unlikely.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.320]   So first of all,
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.260]   what about veteran benefits of the traditional,
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.620]   you know, the health insurance benefits?
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.220]   You should know by this point
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.520]   what benefits your father is entitled to.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.680]   And in general,
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.120]   the Veterans Administration
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.220]   will provide some long-term care benefits.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.000]   And real quick,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.760]   a quick thing you need to understand.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:13.940]   Long-term care,
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:14.740]   when I use that word,
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.600]   what long-term care refers to
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.100]   is long-term care
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.200]   refers to something called a chronic illness.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.980]   And a chronic illness is for something
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.340]   that's not expected to get better.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.960]   So the example here would be Alzheimer's.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.340]   Okay.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.280]   Alzheimer's is not expected to get better.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.380]   There's no cure that anyone that I'm aware of,
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:33.600]   anyone has found for Alzheimer's.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.480]   There's not really any treatment that I know
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.100]   that can be expected to improve it,
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.600]   although maybe it could be slowed down
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.940]   through brain stimulation and physical exercise.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.180]   I've read some of the studies on that.
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.580]   But I'm not aware of somebody saying
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.360]   we can improve the situation
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.080]   through this certain treatment.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.900]   So something like Alzheimer's,
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.340]   once you're diagnosed with Alzheimer's,
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.200]   it's something you have.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.520]   And you're not going to get any,
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.800]   it's not expected to get better.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.820]   Now, that would be compared with
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.060]   falling and breaking your leg.
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.440]   Well, that's considered to be an acute illness.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.220]   And it's something that is going to get better.
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.940]   So when I say long-term care,
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.060]   I'm talking about ongoing,
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.680]   what's called custodial care.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.780]   Care with the activities of daily living.
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.300]   Care with bathing, dressing.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.680]   Help assistance with toileting,
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.260]   with transferring between a bed and a chair.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.060]   Those types of things.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.340]   Those are all considered to be activities of daily living.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.940]   And if you spend some time,
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.360]   so that's custodial care.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.560]   So when I talk about long-term care,
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.200]   I'm talking about ongoing custodial care.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.640]   Not, okay, you went into the hospital.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.760]   Your father is covered under the veterans system
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.560]   and also under Medicare.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.360]   So that's going to take care of some of the hospital benefits
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.320]   based upon what part Medicare is he in.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.800]   Does he have a supplement plan or not?
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.720]   That's all, you should be familiar with that by this point.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.500]   But the Veterans Administration
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.040]   provides a lot of information
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.580]   about what's going on in the military.
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.480]   And so they do it based upon priorities.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.160]   And so as you should be familiar with by now,
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.280]   the veterans benefits are divided into eight tiers.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.280]   So tiers one through eight with some sub tiers
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.320]   based upon whether or not
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.380]   a veteran has a service-related disability.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.880]   And so a disability that was related
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.300]   to their service in the military.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.520]   And so priority group one
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.760]   is veterans that have a service-related disability
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.020]   that is 50% or more disability-related.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:17.480]   So that's the priority group one.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.140]   And then priority group two is veterans
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.200]   who are determined by the VA to be unemployed
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.400]   due to service-related, service-connected conditions.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.680]   So if you are extremely disabled
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.520]   because of some injury that you receive
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.320]   while being in military service,
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.940]   then you're in priority group one.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.260]   And in this situation, there's a very high chance
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.260]   that you will qualify for long-term care benefits
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.460]   under the veterans system.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.480]   Priority group two would be veterans
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.940]   with service-connected disabilities
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.860]   rated 30 or 40% disabling.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.000]   Priority group three, veterans with service-connected disabilities
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.980]   rated 10 or 20% disabling.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.560]   Veterans who were former prisoners of war.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.000]   Veterans awarded the Purple Heart.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.280]   Veterans whose discharge was for a disability
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.580]   that began in the line of duty.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.140]   Veterans who were disabled because of VA treatment
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.960]   or participation in a VA vocational rehabilitation program.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:06.560]   And it goes on down through the eight lists.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.120]   And if you go down into groups six, seven, and eight,
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.100]   there's sub-priorities.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.980]   So in group eight, for example,
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.860]   priority group eight,
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.900]   veterans who agree to pay a specified copayment
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:16.980]   with service-connected disabilities
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.100]   with income and or net worth
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.820]   above the VA means test threshold
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.940]   and the geographic means test threshold.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.020]   Sub-priority A, non-compensable 0% service-connected veterans
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.680]   enrolled as of January, blah, blah, blah.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.040]   So there's all these sub-priorities.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:29.720]   Go Google it.
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.720]   You'll find it right on the Veterans Administration website,
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.600]   all this information.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.100]   You want to find out what group your father is in
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.580]   and just see if there's any chance of getting benefits.
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.600]   I do not know how far down this list
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.540]   they are currently providing benefits.
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.140]   In the past, when I have researched it,
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:46.880]   it was only,
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.640]   the first few,
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.500]   and basically as the costs have gone up
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.060]   and as the budgets have gotten more thin,
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.240]   the VA has had to cut back on benefits.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.660]   The best thing to do there
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:02.000]   is just become very close to the VA consultants
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.880]   that are at the VA
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.600]   and see if there's some program that they know of.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.800]   Now, one thing that would not necessarily be connected
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.620]   to that priority system
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.500]   would be what's called the aid and attendance,
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.820]   the aid and attendance special pension.
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.300]   And so what this is,
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.020]   is the special pension that will pay
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.120]   for additional amounts of money for a veteran
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.160]   who is receiving care at home.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.600]   So I will put a link in,
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.600]   I'll put a link in the show notes here.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.840]   I'll put two links here,
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.700]   one from veteranaid.org
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.900]   and the other from benefits.va.gov.
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.820]   And so the veteranaid.org says,
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.920]   eligibility for the aid and attendance pension.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.780]   Any wartime veteran with 90 days of active duty,
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.180]   one day beginning or ending during a period of war,
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.880]   is eligible to apply for the aid and attendance
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.760]   improved pension.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.320]   A surviving spouse,
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.540]   marriage must have ended due to death of a veteran
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.500]   or of a wartime veteran,
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.660]   may also apply.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.980]   The individual applying must qualify
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.540]   both medically and financially.
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.280]   To see the periods of war that have been qualified by Congress,
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.080]   follow this link.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.400]   To qualify medically,
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.260]   a wartime veteran or surviving spouse
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.140]   must need the assistance of another person
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.360]   to perform daily tasks,
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.440]   such as eating, dressing, undressing,
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.200]   taking care of the needs of nature, etc.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.960]   Being blind or in a nursing home
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.540]   for mental or physical incapacity,
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.760]   or residing in an assisted living facility,
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:17.700]   also qualifies.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.620]   And it goes on and talks about how to get eligibility.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:24.200]   So this is an additional pension benefit
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.740]   that you may be eligible of
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:29.800]   in addition to the other monthly pension benefits.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.820]   So you would want to research this.
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.040]   You need to be housebound.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.860]   And so this might be an option
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.820]   where even at housebound with in-home care,
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.680]   if your father needs in-home care,
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.940]   this may be something where you may be eligible
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.060]   for an additional pension.
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.200]   Now, depending on the income limits,
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:46.680]   you need to,
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.320]   you need to check out the income limits on this program
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.480]   and need to look at the eligibility limits.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.100]   But this would be something that would be
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.780]   something to research
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.440]   and see if you would qualify or not.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.300]   As far as any TRICARE benefits,
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.280]   TRICARE doesn't cover long-term care.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.440]   Basically, that's the broad brush stroke
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.760]   because TRICARE is similar to health insurance.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.820]   So let's just leave it there
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.440]   and not talk about any exceptions to any of that.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.940]   So the next program, Medicare and Medicaid.
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.580]   So in broad strokes,
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.860]   Medicare will not provide any long-term care
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:17.360]   benefits.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.560]   So now that I've said that,
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.400]   here's what they will provide.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.700]   Long-term care, excuse me,
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.260]   Medicare will provide long-term care benefits
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.480]   if care is received in a nursing home
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.500]   following, I think it's a three-day hospital stay.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.880]   And the way they do that is
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.940]   they will pay for the first 20 days of care
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.100]   that are needed in a nursing home
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.220]   after a hospital stay.
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:40.140]   They'll pay for the first 20 days each 100%.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:43.980]   And then they will help pay for days 20 through 100
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.480]   as long as you pay a daily copay.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:46.840]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.000]   I think the current daily copay rate
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.700]   is in the vicinity of about $150 a day.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.840]   So if your father is getting out of the hospital
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.460]   and he goes into a nursing home,
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.220]   Medicare, because he's in the hospital for a stroke,
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.780]   Medicare will pay for the first 20 days.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.620]   And then for days 20 through 100,
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.020]   you'll pay $150 a day copay
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.360]   and Medicare will pick up the balance.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.980]   After 100 days,
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.280]   there are no more Medicare benefits available.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.300]   So after the first 100 days,
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.040]   there are no more Medicare benefits available.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.520]   So in general,
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.820]   Medicare is not a solution for all of us.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.180]   They're ongoing long-term care.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:20.000]   That's why I say Medicare doesn't provide
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.160]   any long-term care benefits.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.440]   Now, Medicaid,
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.760]   which is financial assistance
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.180]   for people for their health situations
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:31.380]   who are broke and who don't have any money
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:32.260]   and don't have any assets,
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.120]   Medicaid will provide long-term care benefits.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.140]   In general,
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.320]   Medicaid will provide long-term care benefits
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.660]   primarily in nursing facilities,
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.380]   primarily in nursing homes.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:44.380]   Now, there have been some changes in this situation
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.460]   over the last few years
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.800]   where Medicaid has been tested
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:46.840]   and there have been some changes
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.600]   in various programs in different states
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.020]   to try to provide more in-home health care.
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.620]   And there's something that's,
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:55.280]   this is a challenging area of government policy
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.080]   because when they try to provide in-home health care,
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.800]   that's cheaper.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.740]   It's cheaper for the,
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.600]   it would be cheaper for the government
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.640]   to provide in-home health care for many people
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.480]   more so than providing for facility-based care
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.820]   such as a nursing home or an alternate living facility.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.100]   So let's go with nursing home
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.900]   versus in-home health care to simplify our example.
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.080]   It's cheaper to provide in-home health care.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:16.620]   Now,
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.140]   the concern is that if those benefits are too generous,
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:20.680]   then what will happen is that
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.380]   because the majority of people receiving care
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.420]   are currently,
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:25.820]   are currently
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:30.020]   doing it informally with no compensation,
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.560]   so this would be your mom caring for your dad at home,
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.340]   she's not going to get any compensation for that.
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.280]   Because,
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.540]   because they're currently receiving care informally,
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:41.920]   if Medicaid starts paying for people to receive
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.840]   in-home health care,
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.200]   the concern is that,
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:44.440]   you know,
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.960]   there's going to be caregivers coming all out
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.760]   from home health care
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.540]   from all over the place,
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:48.880]   coming out of the woodwork and saying,
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.420]   hey,
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:50.200]   pay us money,
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.940]   or just pay for me to keep my family member at home,
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.760]   and that way I can do less of the physical work of the care,
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.500]   and yet they can still be at home.
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.100]   They actually call this the woodwork principle,
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.640]   and it's a big deal in government policy
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.680]   to try to figure this out.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.180]   Now,
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:05.860]   Medicaid is a state-run program,
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.760]   so each individual state will have their own benefits,
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:09.880]   and again,
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.340]   various programs are testing,
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.960]   various states are testing their programs.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.800]   I don't know which state you live in.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:15.780]   I live in Florida,
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:16.740]   so I'm somewhat familiar
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.040]   with Florida's Medicaid laws,
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.100]   but I'm not familiar with your state,
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.560]   and so I'm not going to make any comment
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.640]   about what your state will do.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.200]   Just remember that as a big,
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.400]   broad brushstroke.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.140]   In general,
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.460]   Medicaid will provide for care.
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.040]   Most of the care they'll provide
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.800]   is for a nursing home,
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.720]   and this is kind of the constant challenge
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.700]   because very few people want their family members
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:35.700]   to be in a nursing home.
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.680]   Most people would prefer their family members
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.140]   to be in the comfort of their own home
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.960]   where they're familiar with the surroundings
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:42.700]   and they're comfortable
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.000]   and have the things that they value around them.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:45.640]   However,
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.720]   there are very few governments
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:47.720]   that are going to be able to provide
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.020]   for that.
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.240]   So you want to make sure
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.700]   that you are aware of that.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.540]   If you feel that Medicaid
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:53.940]   is going to be a solution,
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.680]   if you check out your services
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.080]   and you check out the information
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.680]   on your state's Medicaid programs,
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.780]   you need to find out the qualification
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:04.280]   and how do you qualify it
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.060]   and what are the restrictions
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.000]   on qualifications.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.220]   In order to qualify for Medicaid,
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.840]   you have to have income and assets
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.100]   under certain strict numbers,
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.700]   and then you have to qualify Medicaid.
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.700]   So you have to have income and assets
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:19.560]   under certain numbers.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.340]   And with each state,
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.220]   it's a little bit different.
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.440]   But in general,
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.280]   there are three different categories of assets.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.180]   There are what are called countable assets,
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.940]   which are called non-exempt
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.680]   or available assets in some states.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.740]   There are non-countable assets
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.040]   or exempt assets,
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.100]   and then there are inaccessible assets.
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:40.060]   And so the key is to look at your parents' asset mix
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.080]   and figure out which of their assets
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.660]   under your state's Medicaid laws
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.100]   would be countable assets
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.680]   versus non-countable assets.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.380]   So countable assets are any personal resources
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:50.500]   that are owned or controlled
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.720]   by an applicant for Medicaid benefits.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.680]   So these must be spent on care
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.200]   before qualifying for Medicaid.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.740]   Usually this would include stocks, bonds, cash,
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:04.360]   investments, pension plans, annuities,
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.920]   a primary residence, life insurance,
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.460]   vacation properties, investment properties,
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.540]   basically any assets.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.480]   With a primary residence,
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.540]   there's almost always an exception for a spouse.
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:16.620]   Okay, so we'll talk about
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.000]   that in a second.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.980]   Then you have the non-countable assets,
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:20.280]   which would be a small amount of money,
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.580]   usually a few thousand bucks,
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.120]   primary residence,
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.860]   especially if there's a spouse
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:28.020]   that is surviving a community-based spouse,
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.340]   maybe some life insurance,
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.500]   some term life insurance,
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.180]   or some kind of business assets
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.940]   and maybe an inexpensive car for personal use
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.220]   and then various personal items.
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.580]   In general, Medicaid,
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.180]   you're going to have to get rid of all of your assets
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:42.900]   except for those non-countable assets.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.560]   And so as far as the primary residence,
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.040]   there may be a state,
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.740]   a cap on an amount of value that's set by your state.
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.080]   It's usually either about a half a million
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.380]   or $750,000.
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.140]   So under this scenario,
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.200]   your dad's house would be fine.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.960]   And then also there's usually exceptions for the spouse.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.480]   So the laws are generally written such that
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.980]   you're not going to be required to impoverish your mother
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.600]   in order to provide for your father.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:15.780]   And so that's in general going to be the situation.
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.900]   Now, again, there are exceptions.
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.900]   So check your state's Medicaid laws
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.160]   to see what your actual situation would be.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.780]   And then you're going to look at inaccessible assets.
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:30.620]   And so inaccessible assets would be
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:34.780]   anything that the government says
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.280]   this has to be provided for the care.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.860]   And so they're trying to,
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.420]   maybe if this would be where you get into the situation
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.980]   where someone's trying to transfer assets to their children
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.440]   or transfer assets to a friend,
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:50.500]   and then the Medicaid administrator looks at it and says,
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.660]   well, this is a fraudulent transfer.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.700]   Even though this asset isn't accessible to you,
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:54.840]   it has to be spent on your care
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:57.140]   before you're eligible for Medicaid.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.080]   There is now a five-year look-back period
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.160]   for Medicaid eligibility.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.520]   So what that means is that on the date that you go
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.580]   to apply for Medicaid,
[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:06.920]   there is a five-year look-back period
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.260]   under which the Medicaid administrator
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:11.440]   can technically undo any financial transactions
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.000]   that you have done
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.180]   or count them towards your,
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.140]   your Medicaid bill.
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:21.140]   So for example, if you have a half a million dollars of cash
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:23.140]   and you transfer that to your son,
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.140]   and then you go and apply for Medicaid the next day,
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.140]   well, that transfer is going to,
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.140]   you're going to have to spend that half a million dollars.
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.140]   It's going to have to be spent on your care
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.140]   before Medicaid will provide you with the care that you need.
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.140]   So this is a much longer transfer period.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.140]   So you would want to consider doing some Medicaid planning.
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.140]   Now in your situation, it's going to sound pretty simple.
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:41.140]   But once you research your estate's financial status,
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.140]   you're going to find that you're going to have to spend
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:44.320]   half a million dollars on your care.
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.320]   And that's going to be a lot of money.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.320]   And if you're going to be spending half a million dollars
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.320]   on your care,
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.320]   you're going to have to spend half a million dollars
