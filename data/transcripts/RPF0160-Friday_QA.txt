[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.040]   Today on the show we dig into some Friday Q&A. I've got two questions lined up. Number
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.860]   one, Joshua, I've had an ideological change of heart and I no longer can do my job with
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.840]   a clear conscience. How on earth do I transition to another career? Number two, Joshua, my
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:19.920]   income is fluctuating greatly. How do I plan for a fluctuating income?
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.200]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and this is the show
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.300]   for Friday, February 27, 2015. It will not be released on Friday, but it is the show
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.880]   for Friday as promised. Life gets in the way sometimes and sometimes you have to make adjustments
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.540]   and that's what we're doing, but I've got a good one for you. It's useful to learn from
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:51.440]   other people's experiences and that's what we're going to do today.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.960]   I really love doing these Friday Q&A shows because over my lifetime I have learned so
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.280]   much from listening to other people's scenarios and other people's stories. There's something
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.980]   to be said for simply learning from someone else. In so many times it's easier to see
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.560]   what other people should do than it is to see what you should do. I know for me it's
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.640]   very much easier to see what other people should do, but not so easy to see what I should
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.600]   do in my own situation. I'm sure it's the same for you. That's why these Friday shows
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.840]   I think are super, super valuable. Real quick, as we get started, last night
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.520]   we had the first ever Google Hangout for the patrons of the show. I want to thank all of
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.620]   you who came. It was an awesome experience for me. I really enjoyed it. I know many of
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.440]   you were actually unintentionally frozen out of the Hangout. I apologize. There are two
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.620]   kinds of Google Hangouts that the Google Hangout system has. One of them has a system wherein
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.840]   you can allow everyone in and everyone can video chat and video conference. That has
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.600]   a total of 10 people that can be admitted to that call. The other one is Google Live
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.400]   where essentially it transmits a video feed of me to the internet. You can chat in a chat
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.920]   room, but it doesn't allow everyone to be seen.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.600]   I was trying to launch Google Live. I practiced in advance and I had everything ready to go,
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.040]   but I wound up somehow. I still can't figure out how I did it. I accidentally launched a
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.760]   Google Hangout. That allowed only 10 people into the Google Hangout and several of you
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.940]   were frozen out. I apologize to those of you who were frozen out. It was a really fun experience
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.560]   for me to be able to interact with 10 of you face to face and answer your questions and
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.040]   see your face and for us all to see each other. That was super fun. In the future, it'll be
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.880]   more of a scenario where I think you'll be able to see me and I'll be answering questions
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.240]   that you give in a chat room type of environment. We'll have that worked out for next month.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.280]   Thank you to all of those of you who came. I really enjoyed doing it with you. I really
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   did.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.080]   I guess I'll plug in the Patreon account here a couple of ways. Those Google Hangouts are
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.200]   available to you for everyone who supports the show at $10 per month or more. Every single
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.440]   month I'll do a Google Hangout for all the supporters of the show who support the show
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.280]   at $10 a month or more. There are also a bunch of other benefits, but that's one of the primary
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.040]   benefits that you get at that level. I'll try to answer all your questions. I'll try
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.400]   to give you all the details that I can.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.320]   Today also, in a Friday Q&A show, if you're supporting the show for $5 per month or more,
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.160]   your questions will go to the head of the line. I'll get your questions ahead of other
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.080]   people's questions on the Friday Q&A show. At this point, I have too many questions for
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.560]   me to ever answer them all on the show and more coming in all the time, which is great.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.280]   So I think this will help to prioritize it. I think it's in a fairly ethical way where
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.800]   I'm not saying I'm not going to answer everyone's questions. I'm not saying I'm not going to
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.720]   answer anyone who's not a supporting patron of the show, but it does help me to have a
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.560]   way of changing the flow of questions a little bit.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.320]   So I invite you to go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron. You can see all those benefits. So enough advertising.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.000]   Let's get to the questions. First question comes from Bill. Bill has a question about
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.200]   career planning. He writes me this question. "Joshua, the reason why I'm writing has nothing
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.560]   to do with finances but career advice. Did you or do you provide career counseling? If
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.280]   not, can you at least recommend someone you trust? I thought I heard you mention on a
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.960]   previous show that you were involved in that line of work, but unless I'm mistaken, it
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.320]   may have been a guest. Brief introduction. I'm 32 years old, a recent MBA graduate, and
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.840]   have a really unique professional background that makes career transitions exceptionally
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.480]   difficult. Suppose I were a client of yours who was considering a career change at a radical
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.200]   50% pay cut. There are huge financial and emotional considerations at stake. Would such
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.180]   a career change be consistent with my financial goals? I've been working in a specific industry
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.160]   since I started fresh out of college. I have recently undergone an ideological conversion
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.640]   to a different system of thinking, and I now face some cognitive dissonance over what I
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.240]   do for a living and who I do it for. I want out. In fact, this is the reason I went back
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.540]   to school for my MBA a couple years ago. I thought the MBA might help me push the reset
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.520]   button on my career, but the job market hasn't been kind to me. I've applied to all kinds
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.880]   of jobs that I've thought were similar enough to the work I currently do. Unfortunately,
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.100]   I find myself caught between a rock and a hard place. I'm too old to be considered for
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.440]   lower-tiered, entry-level positions. I'm also too inexperienced to be considered for
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.440]   more senior or mid-level positions. I am seen as a liability. Recruiters think I won't
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.240]   last very long if they bring me in at a lower level. Recruiters think I won't last very
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.720]   long if I'm brought into a new environment or industry. I'm stuck. I'm hoping to speak
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.240]   to someone who can help me do two things. One, better understand what marketable skills
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.040]   I have, and two, better understand what jobs exist that are the best match for my skills.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.140]   It gets a little crazier. Due to nondisclosure agreements I've signed, I cannot fully disclose
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.740]   the exact nature of my skills. This is perhaps the real pickle, which makes this ordeal much
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.460]   harder than it would normally be for other career changers. What are your thoughts, Bill?
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.980]   Bill, this is an interesting question, and I'm going to give you some referrals and some
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.940]   resources at the end, but first I want to give you just some ideas, some things for
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:13.180]   you to consider. I have a theme that I refer to continually in my own mind. I've been planning
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.120]   to do a whole show on this. I can't remember where it came from. It may have come from
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.680]   Charles Hugh Smith's books. I'm not sure where it came from, but the theme is how can I focus
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.480]   on working comfortably instead of retiring comfortably?
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.920]   This is probably, if you think this show is all about retirement or early retirement or
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.240]   something like that, that might sound like a bit of a disconnect for you, but I think
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.200]   both of these things are important. I think any time we have a career crisis, we should
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:48.920]   first in essence focus on fixing that. The reality is most of us will spend more time
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:55.920]   in our lives working, earning an income, than just about any other occupation or any other
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:03.120]   activity. Work, actually doing it and thinking about it, consumes a massive percentage of
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.760]   our time, and as such it's going to have a bigger impact on our life than just about
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.960]   anything else. For me, in essence, I've got kind of an almost
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:18.040]   small informal rule. If there's a problem with our career or our work or our income,
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.560]   our job, our business, whatever you want to call it, that's almost always going to be
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:28.160]   the first priority. It's important to change our mindset and not be so focused on this
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.900]   idea of how can I do something that I don't really like just so I can pile up a bunch
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:38.440]   of money and retire comfortably down the road, and rather just simply focus on working comfortably.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.680]   Again, I wish I could remember who I'm supposed to attribute for giving me that phrase. I'll
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.880]   just pawn it off as my own, I guess, because I can't remember it. If any of you know,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.960]   I don't know. I mean, it's the kind of thing that's not really original with anybody,
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.800]   but just remember this. Focus always on working comfortably, not retiring comfortably. Then
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.200]   in essence, you've achieved what most people are trying to achieve through retirement.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.220]   Now I personally was not always this way. I used to be very focused on the income and
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:10.240]   how to do well and have the highest income, but I've changed after years of doing financial
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.220]   planning and meeting with actual people and talking about their money. As far as I'm concerned,
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:20.400]   I've cracked the code on money. I've cracked the code. I don't care all that much about
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.820]   top line revenue. I don't care all that much about what the number is of the salary. It's
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:32.340]   not the most important thing. It does matter, but it's not the most important thing. Remember,
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:39.400]   you can build in today's modern world a life that is comfortable in every way, that has
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:47.760]   all of the conveniences of every kind, a life that is abundant and just wonderful for simply
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.860]   not much money. And you can also spend a lot of money on a life that's not really so abundant,
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:10:00.300]   not really so comfortable. So the primary focus being on top line revenue, on salary,
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:07.260]   is not a valid focus. It's a valid focus, but it's not the only thing. I think a better
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.980]   approach is to say, "How can I optimize my way of earning the income and then work out
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:17.580]   the planning on the back end?" The challenge is this. If a career doesn't fit your personal
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:25.340]   ideology, you can't possibly be world class at it. So that leads you to either you need
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:33.260]   to change your ideology or you need to change your career. There are a few ways to do this.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:39.460]   I would say first, one change I think is a good one to make is change your mindset about
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:45.820]   the nature of your career. I'm not defined by what I do for a living. Regardless of how
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:51.380]   people want to define me by that, I refuse to fit that definition. There are many things
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:57.600]   that I can do for a living, and these things do not define me. Whether I'm Mr. Successful
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:05.300]   Financial Planning Guru or whether I'm world class podcast host or whether I'm a guy who—what's
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.660]   the most menial task? I'm a guy who cleans toilets for a living or I'm a guy who swings
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:14.700]   a hammer for a living or I'm a guy who digs a ditch or who delivers pizzas. I'm still
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:21.340]   the same guy. I'll tell you one of my favorite scenes from a movie. I always loved the movie
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:26.260]   with Harrison Ford. It's called Sabrina. There's a character in that movie. I've watched it
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.980]   a couple times with my wife, and I really enjoy the movie. The character in that movie
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:35.820]   that I would most aspire to be when I was younger, it would have been to be whatever—I
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.420]   think his name was Linus. That was the main protagonist, the hero of the movie, the big
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.660]   business guy. That was who I wanted to be when I was younger. These days, I want to
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:50.180]   be the chauffeur. If you're not familiar with the movie, there's a driver. The chauffeur
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:54.820]   in the movie, he takes a job. It's clear at the end of the movie. It makes it clear. He
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.180]   takes the job of a chauffeur, so it gives him time to read and to learn. Whenever you
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.700]   see him in the movie, he's either driving or he's sitting in his home surrounded by
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:07.380]   his books. The natural outcome is when he's driving the car, when he's waiting for his
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:14.060]   passengers, he has time to read. That was why he chose that career.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.100]   It's funny to me because that to me is what I would rather make that choice and just have
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.740]   the time to pursue the things that are of interest to me and have enough money to support
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.900]   myself. Now, I say that simply because I'm not defined by what I do for a living, and
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:33.380]   neither are you. Our culture would love to define you that way. Our culture would love
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:40.380]   to define you as a cog in an economic machine. It's not true. You're not. I'm not. We're
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:46.540]   not humans doing. We're humans being. It's a big difference.
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.500]   Now, historically, throughout the history of civilization, we all did pretty much the
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:56.800]   same thing. A hundred years ago, the vast majority of us worked in the soil and provided
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:02.580]   for our means of living through the soil. Does that mean we were no different because
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.460]   we all did the same thing? No, we were incredibly different. We just happened to do the same
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:12.700]   thing. As far as I'm concerned, my career is simply a funding mechanism for my life.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:18.740]   It's nice if I can do that and earn my living in an agreeable way. That's really ideal.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:24.060]   But it's not a guarantee, and it does not define me. It's just simply a funding mechanism.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.940]   Now, it's taken me a little bit. I didn't have the confidence years ago to declare that
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:34.900]   quite as freely as I can declare it now. I remember when I got out of college and I had
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.580]   the fancy-sounding job with a fancy-sounding title that could sound really cool. I got
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.100]   to the point where I didn't like doing the fancy-sounding job. I didn't like doing it
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:48.740]   no matter how fancy the title was. I realized I don't really care. I don't need to be judged
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:54.700]   by somebody else's system of social ranking. One of my favorite sayings, "I reject your
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:59.660]   reality and substitute my own." So I just simply view a career as a funding mechanism
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.420]   for my life. That's it. So if you change your mindset about it, I think it can remove some
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:11.820]   of the fear and some of the associated baggage of emotions that's built into our careers.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:20.200]   Remember this. We are trained and conditioned as young, aggressive, career-minded people
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:26.680]   to spend all of our time thinking about our career. After all, a common meme in society
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.220]   is the purpose of schooling is to prepare you for your career. If you don't graduate
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.380]   from high school, you can't get a good job. You heard that. We have job counselors and
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.460]   career counselors that start talking to us from the beginning age. Then that became from
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.220]   getting a good job because you have a high school degree, that became getting into a
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.500]   good college so you can get a good job. So we spend 12 years preparing for college and
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.180]   we spend four years or more preparing in college to get a good job. Then once we get a good
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.340]   job, we're supposed to build out our resumes and you spend all your time focusing on getting
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:15:03.260]   a good job and managing career and you forget about your life. What a waste of time. It's
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:09.340]   a total waste of time. Now, do you need to support yourself? Yes.
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:14.540]   Does the intelligent management of a career make a play a part? Yes. I probably couldn't
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.580]   be doing what I'm doing now if I hadn't done a little bit of an intelligent job managing
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.740]   my previous career. So I'm not saying throw that out the window. I'm saying adjust the
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:29.860]   priority and realize that it may be tough. You may have to undo decades of training and
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.740]   thought about everything is about the career, everything is about the career. That's tough.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:38.300]   But if you get there, man, having been stuck in that career mindset and then also having
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:45.260]   been I guess freed of it, it's pretty liberating to realize that there are thousands of things
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.500]   that I could do quite happily because I'm not identified by my career. I don't care
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:57.460]   whether that's managing a surfer bar in Nicaragua or whether that is running a hostel in Turkey
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:02.380]   or whether that's setting up a business and working as an insurance agent in Hong Kong
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:07.180]   or whether it's working as an urban farmer in Atlanta, Georgia. It doesn't matter. I
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:12.300]   can build something great in any of those areas.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:16.580]   So I know I'm probably laboring at that a little too long, but it's a big factor is
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.180]   that we're scared to mess up our careers. We're scared to mar our perfect little resumes.
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.820]   People say, "I want to take a year off and travel," or, "I want to take two years off
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.340]   and travel, but I'm concerned about what it's going to do to my resume." What's it going
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.700]   to do to your resume? Everybody you ever interview with, that's going to be what they're interested
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:35.620]   in because you have the guts to say, "Forget this. I'm going to go follow my own path and
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.220]   chart my own course and I'm going to go travel."
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.260]   Now does that make you a highly qualified candidate? Probably not because it shows more
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:48.980]   of an independent streak and you might not fit quite so well as somebody with pressure.
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:54.900]   But to the right employer, that ability to think for yourself is going to be the selling
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:00.740]   point. Remember, I think most employers are at least in a small enough business where
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:07.100]   the business owner can actually have contact with many of the employees. Job skills are
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:13.820]   relatively easy to train. Character skills are not easy to train. Of all the business
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:17.720]   owners with whom I've interacted, I think the majority of them would rather have somebody
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:23.580]   that was poorly experienced in a specific area but were very dependable in their personal
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:27.540]   character because you can train most of the things that you need to do. It's hard to train
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.740]   somebody's character flaws.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.820]   So change and adjust and just recognize at least your mindset about the nature of your
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:41.700]   career. Now many people do change their ideologies in order to fit their career. A lot of people
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:49.900]   do that. I've had to think about this. For example, when I got into the financial planning
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:58.180]   world, one of the biggest things that I really struggled with was my ideology prior to becoming
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.580]   a financial planning about certain types of insurance, specifically whole life insurance
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.740]   because I had an ideology that whole life insurance was never an acceptable financial
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:11.060]   product and that was what I spent several interviews trying to figure out.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.300]   Well, then I had to go and I recognized that it wasn't necessarily the career that was
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:21.380]   wrong. It was rather my ideology was poorly informed. There was a lot that I didn't know
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.460]   and once I understood that, I was able to change my ideology and then enter into a new
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:30.060]   career on an ethical basis. So for some people, that might just need to learn something about
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.260]   a career. So just check your ideology and ask yourself, "Am I really violating something
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:42.220]   that's important?" If so, change the career. If not, you might change the ideology.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:47.020]   If you don't want to change the ideology or you can't, change the career. There are thousands
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:52.420]   of careers that I simply couldn't do and excel at for various reasons from the mundane to
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:58.140]   the pretty big. I've always been fascinated with trucking. From the time I was a kid,
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.460]   I wanted to be an over the road trucker. I thought that would be the coolest job in the
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:07.420]   world. Probably most boys, little boys do. But I couldn't do that today with a clear
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:13.260]   conscience. I couldn't do it. It would destroy my family and I'm not willing to do that.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:19.180]   So I simply am not willing to even consider that as an option even though I always thought
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:24.380]   it would be fun. By the way, for some of you, it's not a bad
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:29.100]   retirement plan. I've talked to some people who are husband and wife teams of truckers
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.420]   and they specialize in expedited freight or something where when it's got to get there,
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.660]   it's got to get there. But then there are other times where they can hang out and they
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.420]   live in their truck and they earn quite a bit of money for the two of them with low
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.620]   living expenses. In a few years, they've been able to salvage their retirement. I wish I
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.660]   could get some of them on the show. If any of you know anybody who has a story like that,
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.180]   then let me know. I've talked to some in person, but I've never been able to find someone that
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.220]   I could bring on the show. But it's kind of a potential retirement plan.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:59.380]   If you wind up broke and bankrupt at 55 years old, well, maybe you get on the road as team
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.140]   trucking. Do that for six or seven years, save all your money and you can change your
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.940]   future. But I couldn't be an over-the-road trucker.
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.780]   I couldn't – I don't know. I couldn't work and I couldn't serve in the military.
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.780]   I couldn't work for the federal government even though I thought it would be super cool
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.980]   as a kid. When I was a kid, I always loved reading spy novels and novels about that.
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.060]   I always thought – but a kid doesn't probably. I thought it would be fun to be a CIA agent
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:26.020]   or Jason Bourne or Jack Ryan. For me, I always loved Tom Clancy.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.380]   So I thought that would be fun. Then later on, as an adult, I just evaluated as an adult
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:36.540]   away from the romance of it and realized I could never serve in that capacity with my
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.540]   ethics and my belief system. I couldn't do it. Not saying other people can't do
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.700]   it. I couldn't do it. So I could never excel in that. So I would never be able to do that.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.980]   If I were in that, I would have to change my career.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:54.020]   So some of those types of things you may need to change. It's not that bad to change a
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:21:00.860]   career. A couple of pieces of good career advice that have really helped me and one
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.220]   of them – I just mentioned this on last night's Google Hangout actually with the
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:10.700]   listeners of the show. The source of this was actually John T. Reid's book entitled
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:16.580]   "Succeeding." In that book, he makes this statement and he says, "Go where you're
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:23.100]   valued and appreciated, not where you're merely tolerated." For some reason, when
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.020]   I read that book years ago – and it's a great book by the way. I highly recommend
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.020]   it. It will be on my list of recommended reading. I'll give you in a minute and I'll put
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:34.380]   links in the show notes. But when I read his book, I said, "Go where you're valued
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.860]   and appreciated, not merely tolerated." It just struck a chord.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:44.980]   Now, his example was that he started his career as an army officer. He went to West Point,
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.460]   graduated from West Point, was in the army. I think he was in the Rangers, something like
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:52.180]   that, was an army officer. But he didn't get along well in the army because he wasn't
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:58.940]   willing to play the political game. His army career, although he certainly had an honorable
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:04.780]   discharge and no external markings of that, but his army career was substantially short-lived
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:10.220]   and quite miserable as he relates it simply because he was not willing to bend to fit
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:17.860]   the environment around him. So he was destined to not be successful within that context.
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.700]   But over time, he was able to transition to a different career and he actually transitioned
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.060]   first to the career of a real estate investor and later to the career of a self-help author
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:31.420]   writing self-help books and instructional how-to books.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:37.660]   The exact same character quality which made him persona non grata in the army made him
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:44.100]   loved and valued and appreciated in his career as a how-to book author. Same person, different
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:53.380]   scenario. That was a huge thought for me because I've realized that, for example, in the mainstream
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:23:00.140]   financial planning world, I am, as a person, I'm more tolerated and people appreciate certain
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:05.060]   things but I'm more tolerated than I am appreciated and valued. I'm a bit of a maverick. I've
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:10.020]   got a bit of an independent streak. I've got strong ideas and strong ideology behind certain
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.300]   things and sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:18.100]   But in a world like this, in the world of radical personal finance, that exact same
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:22.960]   character trait instead of simply being – Joshua being someone to put up with, that same character
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.780]   trait can make me somebody that people appreciate. You may not agree with me. Usually, I can
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:32.220]   just give enough time. I'll give you something to disagree with me about. But at least you
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.920]   can understand and appreciate that and I can buff at your thinking a little bit. I get
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.620]   emails all the time from listeners saying, "I just like listening to your show because
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:43.180]   I'm challenged with my ideas." And so it's a strength of – it's just a character
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:47.900]   trait of mine that gets reflected in the world around. So check that book out. I'll give
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:52.900]   some recommended in a minute. But if you are in a place where your ideology doesn't fit
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:59.940]   what you're doing, you got to get out. You got to get out and go where you're valued
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:06.060]   and loved and appreciated, not simply tolerated. Where would you be that? Where would you be
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.140]   loved and appreciated and tolerated? Well, that would be where it sounds like you need
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:14.220]   some time to figure out and know yourself. I don't know a better way to do this than
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:19.700]   to spend a lot of time with a journal. What careers sound fun? Daily list making. Write
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:24.900]   down 30 jobs that to you seem super fun and super interesting. If I were making that list,
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.700]   it would be all kinds of wacky things. I was recently in a kind of a mentoring appointment
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.300]   with a young man that I've been mentoring a little bit and we were talking about this.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.140]   For me, I actually have these lists. But there would be things on there, everything from
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:42.260]   being a commercial sea fishing captain to working in a Starbucks restaurant to running
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:49.460]   a beef ranch to building a financial planning empire. Those things might seem disparate
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:54.460]   to somebody on the exterior. But I actually know specifically why each of those four different
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:59.740]   occupations appeals to me intensely. Now, some people, they say, "Why on earth would
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.340]   you ever want to…" I know the reasons why. So for you, you've got to know those
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.620]   reasons. So start with making lists. Write down what are the jobs that sound fun, what
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.860]   are the careers that are interesting, and then look at them and look for the common
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.000]   threads. What happens is we're often looking for an external solution to our problems instead
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.860]   of understanding who we are and what we want. We spend so much time, and I've been guilty
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.660]   of this, we spend so much time looking outside for someone else to tell us what we should
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:27.900]   do. We don't simply sit down and say, "What sounds good to us? What do I actually think?"
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:32.140]   Spend a lot of time with a journal writing down what are you skilled at? What are the
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:38.580]   skills that you have? What things do you like? Sounds a little airy-fairy, but it's really
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:45.340]   important. Many people have no idea, especially you sound like a motivated go-getter, MBA,
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.980]   getting jobs right out of college. Have you ever stopped to actually ask yourself what
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:55.060]   kind of person you are? The cool thing is you're only 32 years old. The bad thing is
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:59.300]   when you're 70 years old and you realize you've spent 40 years practicing medicine because
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.580]   your mom said it would be a good career for you, and then the reality was you wanted to
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:12.740]   go and, I don't know, travel the world as a vagabond artist. Figure out who you are.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.900]   Yeah, I think some people can help. Things can help. There's all kinds of interesting
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.300]   personality tests you can do. Some of them may be helpful. Some of them may not be.
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.660]   Now, here's the key, though. You do need to do a market assessment and figure out what
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.540]   does the market want. Oftentimes, I get very nervous about some of the career advice I
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:34.140]   hear because we're always focusing. Sometimes, it just feels like we're too much focusing
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:38.060]   on ourselves and what we like and what we want to do and not enough on what the market
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:46.060]   wants and needs. Supply has to meet demand. That's the reality. That's how the marketplace
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:49.940]   works. You need to look at the marketplace and say, "Okay, how could I use these skills
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:54.300]   and use this knowledge and use this ability and use these interests and use these natural
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:27:02.700]   inclinations and proclivities and apply it to a demand that exists in the marketplace?"
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.460]   Look at the trends. I love to teach would be an example. I like to teach, obviously,
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.980]   but I don't have any interest in going into formal academia. Academia is dying. It's going
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:20.100]   to be very slow and very long-lived, but A, I wouldn't fit well in academia and B, the
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:25.820]   trend is down. The trend is down. So I want to be here on the cutting edge of the so-called
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:30.720]   new media where the trend is up. So look at the trends and figure out where does my supply
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.860]   of labor and ideas and skills and knowledge, where does that meet the demand that's in
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.260]   the marketplace?
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.620]   If you spend a lot of time looking and thinking, you should be able to find a bunch of common
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:47.460]   threads in who you are, what you've learned, and what you've already applied and you should
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:53.540]   be able to smoke out those skills that are transferable. You have a wealth of skills
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:28:00.720]   that are transferable to any industry. I'm just using myself as an example because you
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.540]   probably at this point in listening to the show, you know me a little bit and sometimes
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.980]   it's easier to see an example in someone else, but my sales skills are transferable to any
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:14.140]   industry. The things I've learned in the sales of financial products, that's transferable.
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:18.980]   I don't care whether I'm selling cars or airplanes or boats or dog food or cutco knives.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.480]   Sales is a very simple process once you master it. All you need to do is simply find out
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.700]   what the product is that you're going to sell, find out who wants that product, and figure
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:33.900]   out a way to reach those people and convey to them the value of your product. Done. That's
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:38.340]   all you need to know about sales. Now, of course, the permutations of that are infinitely
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:43.420]   complex, but it's a very simple process. You measure the inputs, you measure the outputs,
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:48.180]   you adjust the inputs, you see how that affects the outputs. Done. Create a system of tracking
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:53.300]   it, create a system of actually producing that result and connecting the product with
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:59.060]   the people that need and value that product. It's very transferable.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:03.180]   That was why I wanted to learn sales originally when I was building my career. As I said,
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:09.260]   sales, highly compensated, highly difficult skill set to learn, and infinitely transferable
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.500]   to every business no matter if it's working for someone else or working for myself. That's
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:18.020]   why I set out to learn sales. My investing skills are transferable to any industry.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:22.220]   For example, I always thought it'd be fun to work for some kind of international mutual
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:29.300]   fund or hedge fund as an on-the-ground analyst. I enjoy traveling and I like business and
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.380]   I like finding things out about industries and looking at trends and things like that.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:38.740]   You hear that reflected in this show. I always thought it'd be really fun to be the on-the-ground
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:43.460]   guy traveling around Thailand on a motorbike trying to find where are the up-and-coming
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:51.060]   companies in the Thai economy. To me, that sounds like a tremendously perfect job description
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.060]   for me.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:57.220]   Now, the problem is it's attached to working for a company where, in general, the poor
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:03.860]   analysts are incredibly overworked and, in my opinion, underpaid and it's not a good
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:08.860]   lifestyle fit. Underpaid in the sense of too much work, yeah, they get paid well, but it
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.380]   would just destroy the rest of my life, so I've never pursued that. To me, that sounds
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:17.100]   super fun. That's the skill of business and investing. It's transferable.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:22.500]   It's no different whether I'm out analyzing commercial real estate or out analyzing trying
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:27.980]   to find good farmland for someone who's invested in wanting to buy farms. I have a skill and
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:33.220]   background and an interest in agriculture. I have an understanding and a basic understanding
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:37.860]   and experience with business and I have a real interest in investing and in trends,
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:42.540]   economic trends. So that's what I can take and I can take it out and use that to find
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:48.100]   farmland or I could build a career bird-dogging investment deals for local real estate investors.
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:55.100]   If I had no money, all I got to do is go out, put the hard work in to find local real estate
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.780]   deals. I know a bunch of investors right here in West Palm Beach where I live who, if I
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.740]   brought them deals all day long, the hardest thing is just finding the deals. I brought
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:07.220]   them deals, they put it through their filter, boom. There's thousands of dollars of finder's
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:13.320]   fees for finding the deals. That's a learnable skill and it combines the sales skills, building
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.900]   up the infrastructure. It all works together.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.280]   So once you understand what your skills are and what your interests are, then you can
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:25.140]   create dozens and dozens and dozens of potential careers. Many businesses are very similar.
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:29.940]   One thought I had for you when listening to your scenarios, I would say look at the anti-industry
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:34.820]   for your industry. If you've had an ideological change of heart, perhaps you should go on
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.500]   the attack against the industry in which you're now engaged.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:44.440]   Example, you hear this if you pay attention to the things that get advertised in financial
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:50.960]   media. Oftentimes you hear tax defense companies advertise people who are going to go with
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:56.880]   you against the IRS. Where do those people often get their start? They often get a start
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:03.980]   with a career with the IRS. Now, I personally, I could not – it would be a violation of
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:08.380]   my conscience at the moment for me to want to go and work for the IRS. But I could go
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.980]   and work and be a tax defender and have an excellent fit between my ideology, what I
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:21.220]   enjoy and my skills. A bunch of people do that. They work for the IRS and then they
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:28.020]   transfer over later to a tax defense firm of some kind and they represent people who
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.960]   are in combat with the IRS.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.060]   So is there an anti-industry? Another example comes to me. I don't know if you're familiar.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:38.580]   There's a guy online. You can check him out sometime. His name is Barry Cooper and
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:46.540]   he started off as a narcotics officer and he was working in the narcotics group for
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:50.820]   some law enforcement organization, some local police department I think. If you believe
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:56.100]   his legend in his PR, he was highly decorated and highly successful as a narcotics officer.
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.400]   He had a change of heart and he sat down one day and he's like, "Why on earth am I
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.980]   putting all my time into busting people who are just doing drugs? What is the ethical
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.500]   foundation of busting people who are doing drugs?"
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:14.080]   And he switched and now he is the anti-narc guy. He has a whole website and he provides
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.620]   expert witness testimony. He has a whole site called Never Get Busted where he teaches people
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:24.380]   how to avoid the drug laws, how to avoid getting arrested for drug violations, how to avoid
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:31.940]   prosecution, how to get out, how to pull apart legal cases. He's built a business on it.
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:37.460]   Now I don't know how successful it is. My point is look for the anti-industry, for the
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.260]   industry that you have the ideological heart from. It doesn't get much more obvious than
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:48.060]   to go from being a narcotics police officer to representing everybody against narcotics
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:51.620]   violations and having a website where you teach people and YouTube videos where you
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.660]   teach people how to not get busted for drug violations.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:34:00.060]   Years ago I remember reading a book by John Perkins called Confessions of an Economic
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:06.860]   Hitman. In essence, Perkins describes in his book that his job for years and years was
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:15.940]   to travel the world as an agent of various organizations, the World Bank, just travel
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:22.100]   the world as an agent of various financial institutions and construct deals with various
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:26.580]   countries around the world, financing deals through the World Bank and through the USAID
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.080]   program and set up financing deals with them.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:36.440]   But the goal of his work, the ultimate effect and the goal of his work was to create a system
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:43.100]   of pressure that the United States could bring to bear on those countries to further the
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:47.700]   political goals of the United States. Well, he does this for years and then according
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:51.700]   to his book and according to his story, finally decides, "You know what? This is not right.
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:56.820]   I'm going to change this." At that point in time, comes out and writes the Confessions
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:03.500]   of an Economic Hitman and becomes the anti-political manipulation guy, exposing what he was previously
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.020]   doing and leading the charge against it.
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:11.740]   So whether it's Barry Cooper or John Perkins or more recently Edward Snowden, work for
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:17.980]   the enemy and then go out and expose the enemy or whether it's Julian Assange, not a great
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:23.700]   example but remember – by the way, remember though when you become the anti-industry,
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:27.020]   Bradley Manning, the guy who provided all of the documents for Julian Assange and the
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:33.300]   WikiLeaks stuff, that guy is in jail. So be careful what you do. You'd be winding up
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.300]   in jail.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:39.300]   My point is, is there a way that you can leverage your experience in the anti-industry for the
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:46.220]   industry in which you're ideologically opposed now? I would also say look for work in the
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:49.980]   non-published, non-public job market.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:53.540]   So first, you've spoken with recruiters. Awesome. That's a whole topic in and of
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:58.780]   itself of how to effectively work with a recruiter. I like the idea of using recruiters to find
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:04.180]   work. But if you've not found a good fit with a recruiter or you're not finding success,
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.740]   then you need to create an opportunity for yourself.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:13.180]   Easy one is this. Man, if you are unqualified for jobs, then stop looking for a job and
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:21.020]   go create a business. Sounds silly, but it's not. Here's an interesting thought process
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.780]   for you. What would you do if you were an illegal immigrant to the United States of
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:31.260]   America and you had no ability to legally get a job? How would you do that?
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:35.100]   I've worked with a bunch of them in the agriculture industry when I was younger and I was fascinated
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:41.420]   by this. But one of the things you find is oftentimes you simply start a business. What
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:49.620]   would you do if you were an ex-convict and you had a criminal history in the past that
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:53.700]   made it difficult for you to find a job? I'd say one of the things you could do is just
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:59.180]   simply go look for something where that's not a factor. There are tons of industries
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:03.280]   in which you can do this. There's very consistent well-known industries.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.820]   Half the real estate agents that have a business selling real estate got started because they
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:11.660]   didn't know what to do and they could go out and spend some time studying and get a real
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:15.620]   estate license and start making stuff happen. I don't know if that's of interest, but it's
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.220]   like half the people that are involved in multi-level marketing companies have done
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.900]   exactly the same thing. They needed an ability and somebody came along and said, "Here's
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:27.940]   a product. Go sell it." I've worked with people. Fascinating to me, there are product
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.700]   representatives that just simply go out and find products and then go sell stuff. No one
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:37.020]   ever told them they could. They just set it up and they made the deal happen. Or start
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:41.460]   a business. There's all kinds of businesses. Don't restrict yourself to one specific thing.
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.860]   What happens if you're a corporate employee, you may only be looking in that perspective
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:49.380]   and you're completely forgetting about just going out and creating an opportunity for
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.300]   yourself. If you just go back and listen to all the
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:55.540]   shows that I've done, you'll find tons of examples of stuff like this. Remember, I interviewed
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:38:02.940]   a guy, was it Ryan Finley, who makes his entire living buying and selling stuff on Craigslist.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:07.580]   And he makes a good living, by the way. It took him a while, but he makes an excellent
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:12.220]   living, buying and selling appliances on Craigslist and now he runs an info marketing business
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:18.380]   where he teaches other people how to do that. If you can do it with that, you can do it
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:22.700]   with anything. Another flip side is, so create an opportunity
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.660]   for yourself. Another way to do that is just go into just about any other industry, any
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:30.240]   industry in which you're interested, just about any level and just show up and do hard
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.460]   work and you'll quickly get promoted and advanced to the place that you need to be
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:37.560]   and that you deserve to be based upon your skills and qualifications and work. As long
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.540]   as you're not working in the government, the government is the one place where actually
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:48.100]   performance isn't the basis of promotion. There is just show up, show up and go along
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.260]   to get along basically. But as long as you're not in a government
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:57.300]   entity, you can start at just about any level and if you demonstrate skill and hard work
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:00.980]   and work ethic and integrity and character and all of those good things that certainly
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:08.980]   I'm sure you have, you'll quickly be advanced. In reality, I would say you kind of focus
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.580]   on what industry do you want to be in and then just get in, get a foothold in and once
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:19.260]   you're inside the industry, then everything is going to be a lot simpler to you.
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.440]   Another thing that is you're looking for a job and this is why you have to start with
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:28.700]   skills and talents and what interests you have is just simply sell your way in. It's
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:34.980]   a real pity in my opinion that we don't teach sales skills to young people. As far as I'm
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:38.740]   concerned, we ought to scrap half of trigonometry or the whole year of trigonometry and teach
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:44.660]   sales skills. I think we'd have far more effective and happy and successful and richer
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:50.720]   and better adapted adults if we did that. But we don't teach sales skills. We teach
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:55.980]   resumes and we have classes in college on writing a resume. Writing a resume and trying
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:01.060]   to get a job with a resume is like trying to go out and sell a Ferrari with a written
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:06.980]   brochure. You don't sell a Ferrari with a brochure. You sell a Ferrari by tossing a
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:16.260]   rich guy the keys and saying, "Get in and see how it sounds." A resume might be a
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:22.220]   necessary box to check but it's not the way to sell a job. Go out and create an opportunity
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.460]   for yourself. So if you're going to do this, you need to know your target industry. You
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:29.480]   need to network your way in. You need to sit down and make a list of is there a company
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:34.180]   or there are a number of companies. Let me use this as an example. Let's use my IRS
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:37.900]   versus anti-IRS industry example. Let's say you're working for the IRS and you say,
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:42.420]   "I don't want to be a revenue agent anymore but I really would like to kind of change
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:49.700]   because I've had an ideological change of heart. By the way, I have some friends and
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:53.340]   actually clients, former clients who are revenue agents. No problem. I'm just saying for
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.500]   me that wouldn't be a good fit." But let's say for you, you want to transition from being
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:02.100]   a revenue agent for the IRS to something else. What you do is you make a list of all the
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:06.180]   skills and abilities and resources you have and you make a list of all of the firms that
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:10.020]   are the leaders in that space. You research and identify which are the firms that you
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:13.220]   actually want to work for, which are the ones that have a good reputation, which are the
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:17.780]   ones that are doing a good job, that are behaving ethically. You take that short list. You figure
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.420]   out who at these firms do I need to meet and do I need to know and you sit down and you
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.860]   call if they're small or medium-sized firms. You call the CEOs of every single one of those
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.120]   firms and you tell them, "Listen, I'm currently working in this capacity with the IRS. Now
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:34.460]   I want to transition and I want to work with you. I don't know if you're hiring. I would
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.660]   like to come by and give you an opportunity just to share with you a little bit of my
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:41.340]   story and see if I could be a fit for you in the future when you have opportunities."
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:47.180]   Don't wait for a job posting and apply. It's too late. Make it. Find out in advance or
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:51.620]   at least get on the list. Network your way in. Learn your way in. Promote your way in.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:57.180]   Start a whole business and start a whole website about it. Do something flashy and unusual.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.220]   There are dozens and dozens of ways to do this depending on the amount of time you have,
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.340]   but it all comes back to the stuff I've talked about tons of times. Become a leader in your
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:09.900]   field. Establish your reputation. Market yourself. Create for yourself a way to be highly in
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:10.900]   demand.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:14.780]   If you spend more time thinking about that and less time thinking on how do I effectively
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.300]   write a cover letter, I think you'll – yeah, the cover letter might be important because
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:24.420]   remember, the business owner has to check the box so that the Equal Employment Opportunity
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:28.500]   Commission doesn't get on their back. That's why they advertise jobs. I'm convinced half
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:33.140]   the jobs that get advertised purely get advertised just simply so that the head of HR cannot
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:37.220]   get fired or can have some legal standing.
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:40.900]   But man, I've never gotten a job off of a – job offer myself and I've never really
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:45.580]   seen anybody get a job off of a job offer. You're working in a – the problem is this.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:51.060]   Even if the company is legitimately advertising for a job, and I'm not saying they're not,
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:55.820]   you're competing at the point of massive competition instead of creating the demand
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:56.820]   up front.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:02.820]   Give an example. I have this – I've had this discussion with people in the financial
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:06.980]   planning industry and very few people of them understand. The big focus – and I think
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:12.060]   it's right, but a big focus is how do I get leads in financial planning industry?
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:15.100]   And so everyone is always focused whether it's – whatever aspect you're in, whether
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:20.340]   you're selling insurance or whether you're doing comprehensive, some kind of in-depth
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:26.940]   planning. A lead in my experience, I would generally not want just what most people market
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.100]   as leads. If you're in the financial planning business, if you sign up for information on
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.940]   a website, you're going to immediately get on a list of leads and you're going to be
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:33.940]   sold.
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:38.100]   And so agents and reps sometimes have to go out and buy lists of leads. And can it work?
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:43.220]   Yes, it can work. And I want to clarify a piece of information here. When I say lead,
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:47.700]   I'm talking about a non-qualified or only moderately qualified lead, someone who doesn't
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.900]   really know much about me but they're interested in – let's stick with insurance.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:54.220]   Somebody wants to buy life insurance. They put information into an online website for
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:59.040]   a quote – they're interested in a quote and that's it. I'm not talking about somebody
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.660]   who listens to Radical Personal Finance for an hour and a half a day and who knows me
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:05.540]   and who knows everything about me and then comes to me for information. That's not a
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:11.180]   lead. That is a highly qualified prospective client if I were doing that type of planning
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.180]   business.
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.620]   Let's just stick with a lead. I hate working with leads. I hate it. I hate it, hate it,
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:21.060]   hate it. You know why? Because now I'm in competition. I'm in competition with two
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:26.980]   or three or 15 other insurance agents and I've got to somehow beat them out. I've
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:31.620]   got to do some kind of dog and pony show. 100% of the time, if I've got to build my
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:36.180]   business on that, I would 100% of the time say no and I would go work with people who
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:41.020]   have no idea that they even want to buy life insurance. I would approach them out of the
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:45.260]   blue. I'd go cold call and approach them out of the blue and talk to them about life
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:51.580]   insurance and then through some skillful discussions and some good questions and some good discussion,
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:55.180]   ask them if they have any interest in buying life insurance because now it's just me
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.180]   and I'm not in competition.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:01.460]   Well, it's the same thing in finding a job. If I go out and I apply for a job and there
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:07.780]   are dozens of other highly qualified applicants, now I'm going to be sorted across stupid
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:14.780]   criteria. Like did I go to a more prestigious college or university than the other guy?
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:20.340]   Do I have an MBA after my name or not? I would much rather go out and create an opportunity
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:24.660]   where there is no competition, find what I want to do, go out and find who needs what
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.460]   I want to do and demonstrate to them that I can do it even if I've got to go work
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:33.620]   for free for two months and demonstrate it to them rather than following the clogged
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:41.620]   up mechanism of replying to job ads on monster.com. Not that it can't work, just I don't have
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.460]   any interest in dealing in that world. So I would suggest to you that my plan is a little
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:50.820]   bit – I don't know. For me, it's better but your mileage may vary. Check it out.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:54.700]   Couple of very important technical ideas for you. Number one, you got to have a sound financial
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:46:01.660]   plan and so here would be what I mean. All of your ability to do these things is built
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:07.740]   and is contingent on your flexibility. So do you have money? Do you have savings? If
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:12.020]   you don't have savings and you recognize you're at a career transition point, stop
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:20.180]   any kind of external investments and save money and pile up money. If you have debt,
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:24.100]   clear your debt because when you're talking about taking a 50% pay cut, if you're spending
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:28.560]   90% of your income, taking a 50% pay cut, there's no possible way to do it unless
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.540]   you get rid of a bunch of debt and you cut your expenses. But if you're spending 20%
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:37.580]   of your income or you could live on 20% of your current income in another scenario, then
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:42.460]   yeah, take a 50% pay cut any day, especially if you're going into a career that you actually
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:46.060]   want, that you actually want to be a leader in and you can go from that 50% pay cut over
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:50.100]   the next three or four years to making double or triple or quadruple what you're making
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:57.580]   at your current job. But if you remove all of the fixed obligations, so you clear your
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:05.460]   debt, you have savings and you're flexible on your lifestyle, maybe you can – then
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:12.060]   you can look at it as a comprehensive transition. If you move from New York City to rural Mississippi
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.500]   and you earn your income online, you might be able to build a way better lifestyle and
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:21.540]   way less money. So there are some very practical financial planning steps that you need to
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.540]   consider on this journey.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:29.140]   A couple of book recommendations and I hope this has been helpful for you. I hope it's
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:34.660]   just some ideas to spark your thinking. Realistically, I can't solve your problem but you can.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:41.300]   Just apply a system of discipline, focus, systematic thinking. Ask yourself, "If
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:48.180]   I were the president of this company and I'm putting all my fancy MBA knowledge to work,
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:52.260]   how would I do this?" and coach yourself through the process. Here are some books that
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.620]   might help you.
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.620]   The obvious one and kind of a good entry level one, a great one is Dan Miller's book,
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:03.400]   48 Days of the Work You Love. Some resonates with some – there are a bunch of mainstream
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:06.780]   job books. This is one. There's like What Color is Your Parachute is another famous
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:12.300]   one. Read them. Just look for inspiration but he does a good job. He has a good podcast
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:16.620]   if you're interested in career stuff. I've listened to it a little bit here and there.
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.820]   Check out Dan Miller's work. He's got a bunch of career coaches that he does some
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.740]   career coaching. He certifies career coaches and I think there's probably a big value
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:28.860]   for career coaches and there may be a huge value for you in that context.
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:33.140]   Next check out John T. Reid's book, Succeeding. It's just a good, really good general book.
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:37.660]   He doesn't really specifically talk about the job market but he does a little bit and
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:41.900]   I've just really enjoyed it since I mentioned it. Let me add that to the list. It's a
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:47.100]   good book. James Altucher wrote a book last year or the year before called Choose Yourself.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:52.060]   It's really an interesting, unusual book but he makes a big point of just simply like
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:56.220]   pick what you want to do. Choose yourself. Well worth reading. I enjoyed it when I read
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.220]   it.
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:02.260]   Then a good one which is pretty deep and pretty meaty but a well-written book. I don't
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:07.220]   enjoy a lot of the fluffy books because oftentimes they're just so fluffy and they hit at
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:11.180]   a point but the best book I've found that's kind of a comprehensive textbook on finding
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:17.460]   a job is by a guy named Charles Hugh Smith. His book on this subject is called Get a Job,
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:22.700]   Build a Real Career, and Defy a Bewildering Economy. It's kind of a comprehensive look
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:28.980]   at the whole idea of how to get a job, build a real career and how to defy a bewildering
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:33.500]   economy. So check that book out. I'll make sure there's links in the show notes.
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:38.900]   But man, listen, there are a world of incredible opportunities out there right now. So I say
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:44.140]   just get started and choose something you're passionate about and go focus on it. Go change
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.420]   the world. Choose something that interests you.
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:51.460]   I close this question with this scenario. Years ago, I don't remember where I heard
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:57.180]   it, somebody described to me the concept of the hallway. It's been a helpful concept.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:02.380]   And the idea is sometimes we open up a door and we look down a long hallway. We don't
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:06.420]   see anything except this long hallway. And we're a little scared to start walking down
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:12.700]   that hallway. And so we sometimes don't do anything. We just sit and we sit and we sit
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:17.740]   and we sit and we sit and we sit and we sit. But if you would stop sitting and actually
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:22.220]   take a step forward and start walking, all of a sudden, there's a door. And you didn't
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:26.460]   see it from the end of the hallway. But now you see the door and you can open up the door
[00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.940]   and you can look through it and see what's interesting on the other side. Maybe there's
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.120]   nothing there, in which case you close it and you keep going to the next one. Or maybe
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:36.340]   you go down that hallway or go into that room or whatever it happens to be.
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:44.180]   The point is if you start moving, whatever that looks like, things happen. Exposure creates
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:49.220]   opportunity. As a former boss of mine, beat into my head every day, exposure creates opportunity.
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:53.620]   It's kind of funny. When I started Radical Personal Finance, I had no idea. I still practically
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:57.260]   have, I'm figuring things out, but I didn't really know what I'm doing. I just kind of
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:02.620]   had an idea. But man, I've had so many opportunities that have come to me since doing it. But they
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:08.940]   wouldn't have come if I hadn't taken action. So just get started and start exploring, start
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.140]   reaching out to people, start networking. If you have a target industry, start writing
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:17.660]   down lists of target industries or start talking to people. Make a podcast about your job search.
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:21.300]   Call people and say, "Hey, listen, I'm trying to find out what do you love about your job
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:25.340]   or I'm trying to figure out what's right for me." Write a blog series about it. Do something.
[00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:29.580]   All of a sudden, some opportunities will emerge that you'll be really excited about. But if
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:34.020]   you're in a situation where you are hurting your conscience every day in what you're doing,
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:38.500]   you got to get out. Otherwise, you're going to wind up in an unhealthy place. Hope that
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.500]   helps, man.
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:43.620]   All right. Next question. It's a good thing I only grabbed two questions for today. I
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:47.740]   knew that one would go for a while. Next question comes from Brandon. He says, "Hey, Joshua.
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:51.780]   Thanks so much for the show. It's really helped me and my fiancé get our finances in order
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:56.060]   and to start us thinking about how we could become financially independent. Even as a
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:59.180]   Canadian, I've gotten a ton out of the show and I've tried to hook as many people as possible
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:03.520]   as I can." Thank you, Brandon. That is a huge deal. If you want to help the show, the biggest
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.440]   thing you can do, just tell people about it. Tell them about the show and then tell them
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.980]   just go to the App Store and search "radical personal finance" and you can listen. I made
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:14.220]   it super easy. Just go to the App Store, search "radical personal finance." Keep going.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:17.720]   "I was wondering if you might be able to touch on tips and tricks for someone who doesn't
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:23.100]   earn a consistent or regular income. I do video work and while it's consistent right
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:27.740]   now, I've spent most of my career either working every day in a month or not working at all
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:31.940]   for weeks at a time. I was just curious if there might be any wisdom you can impart on
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:37.260]   those kinds of situations. Luckily, my fiancé has a very stable job and makes good money
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:40.820]   so it gives us the ability to plan at least a bit. Thanks again for the show. I look forward
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:46.100]   to it whenever I walk the dog and on the way to work. Brandon." Brandon, thank you for
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:53.100]   the question. This is fun. So I would give you two simple answers. You said, "I was
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:55.760]   wondering if you might be able to touch on tips and tricks for someone who doesn't earn
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:00.520]   a consistent or regular income." The first answer, the big one, is start earning a consistent
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:06.000]   or regular income. I know that sounds kind of smart, Alki. It was meant to a little bit.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.720]   I'm serious. Change your income from an irregular income to a regular income and I'll give you
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:13.120]   a bunch of ideas on that. That would be the first way that I can go with answering this
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:17.560]   question and I'm very serious about that even though there is a bit of tongue in cheek.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:23.360]   Just simply stop earning an inconsistent income. It is hard to budget for an inconsistent and
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:29.720]   irregular income. It's hard to make that work. So make your irregular income a regular income.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:34.240]   We'll talk about that. Number two would be, yes, you can adjust the budgeting system but
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:39.880]   this is tough. So let's focus most of our time and attention on how to change from an
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:46.680]   irregular income to a regular income. The big thing I would focus on is simply increasing
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:55.880]   the demand for your services, whatever those are, so that you can pick and choose and schedule
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:54:04.480]   the work when you want to have it. If you simply focus on that, you can solve your inconsistent
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:11.320]   and irregular income problem. How do you do that? Well, it probably comes down to how
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.860]   good is your product. Do you have a really excellent product? Also, how effective is
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:20.480]   your marketing? Probably the disconnect, which is for most of us, is how effective is your
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:26.520]   marketing? But the key is create the demand for your products or services so that you
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:33.600]   have the choice over when and where you fill it. There is somebody in your industry, no
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.840]   matter the industry, and especially in the video industry, there's somebody in your industry
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:44.880]   who picks and chooses when they want to work. Become that person.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:49.520]   You can do this in just about any business. One of my favorites, let's see, probably one
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:55.400]   of my favorite examples here would be a guy named Joe Girard. I came across Joe Girard
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:55:00.320]   years ago. I don't even know how. I've researched all these weird arcane things. Joe Girard
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:04.320]   is most famous for being recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:10.160]   greatest salesman. He trumpets that high and loud, which is awesome. Good for him. Guinness,
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.520]   the year that he was done was the last year they ever awarded that. He was amazing. He
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:22.440]   sold over 13,000 cars. He sold 13,001 cars at a Chevrolet dealership between 1963 and
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:29.600]   1978. In case you're interested, that's 15 years, which means he sold an average of 866
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.200]   cars per year over his entire career.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:36.800]   Now, interestingly, I actually have reached out to him for an interview. He's declined,
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.520]   so I'd love to get him. If any of you know him, tell him. I'd like to interview him on
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:45.720]   the show. For now, I'll just recount his story. When Joe Girard started working, he was broke
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.640]   and he couldn't feed his family. He tells this. He was completely broke. He'd been a
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:57.040]   total failure. He went down to an auto dealership. It was in Michigan. He went to a car dealership.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:02.760]   He said, "Listen, I need a job." This ties in perfectly to the first question. I'll give
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:06.480]   you a few details on the story. If I get anything wrong, it's just because I last read his books
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:09.440]   five, six, seven, eight years ago, something like that.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:13.440]   He walks into this car dealership and he says, "I need a job." The sales manager said, "I'm
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:17.560]   not going to hire you." He says, "I don't need any more people." If you're not aware,
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:27.000]   in the car sales industry, there needs to be a certain number of salespeople. You know,
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.480]   it's a ratio of people that come in because most of the salespeople get most of their
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:35.320]   business based upon walk-ins, walk-ins to the dealership. People walk in. The next salesperson
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:39.880]   who's up walks out and takes them. If they sell them a car, they get the commission on
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:45.260]   that car. Joe was desperate. He strikes a deal with the guy. He says, "Listen, I won't take
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:50.120]   any walk-ins. I don't need any walk-ins. Just give me the ability to sell some cars. I won't
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:55.960]   take anybody from the floor." The sales manager says, "Well, I guess if that's the deal, you
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:00.960]   can do it." He gives him a desk upstairs. Joe Gerard goes up and he starts cold calling
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:05.800]   out of the white pages or yellow pages to sell cars. As memory serves, he spent all
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:10.240]   day cold calling. He didn't get many leads. He called and called and called and he was
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:15.800]   desperate. Late at night, it's 7.30 at night or something, he walks downstairs. The guy
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.880]   had no training. He walks downstairs and sees a customer there in the showroom. He looks
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:23.040]   around and there's nobody there. There's no other salespeople there. He goes over and
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:27.920]   he starts helping the customer. He sells the guy a car. He didn't know what he was doing,
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:33.360]   but he went ahead and he sold the car. That started his career. He sold a car on his very
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.920]   first day, but it was pure happenstance. It was actually a technical violation of how
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:42.320]   he had started. It gave him the courage to keep going. He just kept on calling and calling
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:47.400]   and calling. As memory serves, a few months later, he had sold so many cars that all the
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:51.640]   other salespeople were jealous. The dealership ended up firing him. Now, he went to another
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:57.040]   dealership and that was where he worked his career at a Chevrolet dealership. The key
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:01.280]   that I remember, if you know anything about car sales or if you ever talk to car salespeople,
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:09.240]   the average car salesperson sells very few cars. Joe Girard, in one year, he sold over
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:16.800]   1,200 or 1,300 cars one year. In his career, he sold 13,000 cars. That's 866 cars per year,
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.520]   but he was slower at the beginning than at the end. In one year, I think he sold over
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:24.680]   1,300 cars or about that number. These were all, as he puts it in his books, person to
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:30.320]   person, belly to belly, cars at fair prices with people, fair prices without—it wasn't
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:34.360]   fleet sales where he's selling 200 cars at a time, although that's not a bad strategy,
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:37.960]   by the way, if you're in sales. There's an interesting story I heard one time about
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:42.360]   the Cutco, one of the Cutco leaders who took that strategy. We'll save that for another
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:49.920]   time. He told the story. He had customers lined up outside of his office to buy a car
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:58.320]   from Joe Girard. Over time, he got to the point where he had so many people coming to
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:03.360]   buy a car from him that he had them lined up, he hired staff, and ultimately, in the
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:11.280]   end, he only sold cars by appointment. I'm serious. He only sold cars by appointment.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:15.560]   He had people lined up. He had a team of people. He had a couple of assistants that handled
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.720]   all the paperwork for him. He had somebody that came in, and when somebody was going
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:22.280]   to come in and trade their car in, that person would do the appraisal and get all of that
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:26.360]   prearranged. They get their financing prearranged, and Joe would just simply do the final sale
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:31.320]   right there in his office. You say, "How on earth did he do that?" Well, that's—you
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:36.320]   go read his books, and you'll see how he did that. Listen to his audio. He did it with
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:41.280]   a comprehensive system. For example, he sold good quality cars at a fair price. He took
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:45.520]   care of his customers. He was aggressive with his marketing and his advertising. He would
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:49.440]   go to football games, and he would take a briefcase full of business cards, and he would
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:53.900]   throw them around. He would just throw them in the air and say, "Buy a car from Joe
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:59.600]   Girard." He would send all of his customers away with a massive stack of business cards
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:03.320]   in their glove box, and he would tell them all. He would call them all a couple of days
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.600]   later and say, "Has people been admiring your car? Who are those people?" He would
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:10.480]   call those people and come and buy a car from Joe Girard, and he would give them a great
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.360]   deal. He had the whole service department. He took care of, in essence, a lot of his
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:18.080]   own service to make sure that his customers were happy and they came back every single
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:23.080]   time. He had a whole comprehensive mailing system set up where every single month, every
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:27.840]   person that ever bought a car from him, every single month received a card from him. It
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.080]   would be, "Happy New Year," and "Happy Valentine's Day," and "Happy March,"
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.880]   whatever you do in March, and "April," and "May," and "June," and "July,"
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.800]   "Happy Birthday." He was constantly top of mind. He would constantly stay in contact
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.840]   with his customers, and from everything, from all appearances, his customers loved him.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:48.640]   By the way, from financial planning, interesting financial planning tip, he got rich in 15
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:55.480]   years and retired. He didn't want to do it forever. He got rich in 15 years and retired.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.960]   Saved a bunch of money, retired, did a little bit of corporate speaking and things like
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.840]   that after retiring, but he didn't want to do that for the rest of his life. He was
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.240]   working hard. It was hard work.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.560]   What was my point? My point is that you can probably do that in just about any industry
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:16.160]   if you figure out how to do it. The key is to go from ho-hum, same as every other video
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:22.520]   person, to being in the upper echelon of your field, getting to the top 20%. How do you
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.240]   do that? I don't know. I don't know how you do it in your industry, but all you need
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.040]   to do is get started studying and learning and applying what others have done and see
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:36.640]   what works. Just apply. Go down the road map that others have already gone down and apply
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:41.960]   what they've done and see if it works for you. I'll use myself as an example.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.080]   In the past, I wanted to increase the demand for my financial planning services. I wanted
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.680]   to spend less time working with people who weren't a perfect fit for me. I wanted to
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:54.920]   spend more time working with multimillionaire entrepreneurs and people who were close to
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:01.920]   retirement. That was what I wanted to do. One of the motivations I was starting a show
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.120]   was I sat down and I said, "You know what? If Dave Ramsey did individual financial planning
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:11.480]   and financial coaching, he would be booked solid morning to night at any rate he wanted
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:18.320]   to charge. He could charge $10,000 an hour and he would be booked solid from day to night."
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.960]   I said, "What did he do? He's got nothing on me other than a 20-year head start."
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:29.280]   So I said, "Well, I've got this desire to do this show and worst case scenario, the
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:34.080]   show becomes an excellent marketing vehicle for my personal financial planning services.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:41.520]   Best case scenario, it becomes its own profitable business." So I focused on marketing. I started
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:48.800]   doing this. As I do it, I'm simply copying and modeling and learning from the people
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.400]   who are the best in the business. Why is my show here Monday through Friday? It's because
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:58.200]   I just with Dave Ramsey and Clark Howard and Jim Cramer on TV and Suzy Orman. That's what
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.920]   they do. They do a show five days a week, so I'll do a show five days a week. I'm studying
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.520]   them and applying all the fundamentals. I'm copying them, but I'm making it better.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:10.480]   I studied Dave Ramsey's business model. I say, "Where does his income come from?" I
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:13.520]   look through his products and I figure out, "Okay, he's got this. He's got this. How
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:17.240]   does his business work?" Well, at this stage, originally, he just started with an idea,
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:26.360]   but the radio program simply serves as an outlet for people to find out about him. That
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:31.800]   leads them into his sales funnel. The radio program is presented to them free, but he
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:37.640]   makes money on the radio program with advertising. This is his business model. He produces a
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:42.520]   radio program. It's broadcast across the nation. People like listening to it. It's interesting,
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:46.480]   so it's picked up by more stations that pick up and pay him for it. Then it's also paid
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:55.120]   for with advertising. His listeners are listening to his show and they're listening to his advertising,
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:01.240]   so they're actually paying him for his show. Then as they consume the content, then at
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:04.080]   some point they say, "You know what? I need something that's a little bit more specific,"
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.640]   so he's advertising his specific books and his courses.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.560]   I say, "I'm going to go ahead and buy Total Money Makeover. I'm going to go ahead and
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:13.480]   buy this new book on kids' finances." They go ahead and buy it. Well, this starts the
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:17.600]   deeper relationship. They're working through the sales funnel. Then he's constantly on
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.840]   the show. He's constantly referring to his book. He's sending them out to his listeners.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:25.600]   He's referring to his courses, so he's setting up Financial Peace University classes and
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:30.240]   sending people to those classes. Then he's creating and marketing those classes to other
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:35.760]   demographics. He sells it to churches and he sells it to businesses. Then he creates
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.800]   a kids' curriculum, so he's building out more markets to reach more people. It's all built
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:46.120]   upon the core and the foundation of the verbal radio show.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.080]   But he's got dozens and dozens and dozens of lines—well, probably not dozens and dozens,
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:56.160]   but he's got over a dozen individual distinct lines of income. He's got seminars. He's going
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:00.000]   and speaking at seminars. Then he creates other seminars. Some people listen to how
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.440]   an A-list client of the Dave Ramsey empire goes through their program. They start with
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:11.680]   listening on the radio. Their listenership creates income for him from the radio station
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:16.360]   paying for his program and also for them listening to their commercials. So that starts. Then
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.440]   they go ahead and they probably buy a book. They may or may not read it, but they probably
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:22.280]   buy a book. Then they'll probably give that book away to their friends and they'll buy
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.800]   more books. At some point, they'll probably go to a Financial Peace University class if
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.680]   they have a good experience there, which by the way is a brilliant business model because
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:36.080]   Dave Ramsey sells the curriculum and other people do all the work and he has no responsibility
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:41.640]   for paying them to do the work. So he's got a bunch of people who are proctoring the class
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:45.540]   because of their desire to help. He's getting rich from selling the product. They're helping
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:50.480]   and they're creating and building more customers for the business. It's brilliant. It's absolutely
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.760]   brilliant. It's amazing. He's an amazing business guy.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.840]   So then they become interested. They come to a live event, a live seminar to bring their
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.760]   reluctant spouse along is usually what it is. Then they go to one seminar. They go teach
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:06.520]   another class. They buy more books. He serves them with four or five new books depending
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:11.000]   on the situation. They buy the envelopes for their – the envelope system and the fancy
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:18.480]   little vinyl thing that you stick in your pocket for your managing your cash and he
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.240]   sells them. He's got a whole other source. So the business owner doesn't necessarily
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:26.480]   need my information on how to get a credit card debt, but how can I teach people what
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:31.080]   I'm doing with his Entree Leadership Program and high-end exclusive events and just look
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:36.600]   at it and you sit back and you say, "What a brilliant business model and what a brilliant
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:42.840]   business mind." It's absolutely amazing.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:47.200]   He's doing a job that is desperately needed. The market is desperate for his work and for
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:54.720]   his information. I just judge that by the numbers and by the sheer volume of his success.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:07:02.880]   He's helping a ton of people who are committed, passionate, not only customers but advocates.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:08.800]   He's an evangelist and they're advocates and they would defend him and his philosophy,
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:18.440]   many of them, extremely vigorously. I know because I once did that.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:30.580]   He's built an empire little at a time, consistently, and he is the number one guru in this space.
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:35.800]   So all I'm doing is copying what he did. He didn't get that. He got there in 20 years.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:41.200]   So I can't expect to do the same thing in 20 months, but I can get there in 20 years.
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:45.800]   So what am I doing? I create – trying to create really great written – excuse me,
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.840]   verbal content. Trying to create it, working hard. Okay, that's the first thing I got
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.600]   to do. That has been working.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.560]   Next, I need to get paid for that verbal content. I don't particularly want to go out and
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.880]   build out advertisers. That's why I came to you, the audience, and I established the
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.980]   Patreon program. That allows me to get paid for creating that content.
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.720]   Now what am I trying to do on the back end? Well, I'm trying to build the systems and
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.980]   the support to build me – to create for me the bandwidth so that I can create other
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:15.680]   additional products to scratch the itches that the audience has. So that will be additional
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:20.400]   books, additional information products, additional courses, additional seminars. Who knows? At
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.000]   some point, maybe I'll find the right fit and we'll start a new financial planning
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.600]   firm. I don't know. So I don't know where all these things are, but my point is by understanding
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:32.320]   what did the leaders in the industry do, I can start.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:39.680]   So go and do that likewise. There's someone in your field who's booked solid all the
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:44.680]   time, completely high in demand. Go copy them. Call them up on the phone and it's better
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.760]   if you go and find a dozen people in your industry. Call them up on the phone and say,
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:52.600]   "I'd like to take you to lunch. You don't know me, but I've been observing your level
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:56.320]   of success and you certainly don't owe this to me, but would you be willing to let me
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.040]   take you out to lunch and ask you a few questions? I'd really benefit from the career advice
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:03.280]   if you're willing." Who's that in your industry? Is it Steven Spielberg? Will he
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:08.000]   go out to lunch? I don't know. Maybe he will. Is it Phil – what's the guy that
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.800]   does Lord of the Rings? You know, big famous producer. Will he go out to lunch? I don't
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:15.040]   know. Maybe he will. He eats lunch and he usually eats lunch with other people. So maybe
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.880]   you need to make a couple of connections. Maybe you need to reach this agent. I don't
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:21.880]   know. But maybe it's just the guy or gal in the next town over that has a really successful
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:26.120]   video business. Connect with them and learn from them.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.960]   So thing one is focus on increasing the demand for your services so that you can schedule
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.320]   it consistently. Now, it is possible that you could have an industry that simply doesn't
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:42.440]   lend itself well to being booked solid. If your job is shoveling snow, you don't have
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:46.800]   any business the rest of the year when there's no snow on the ground. So that's not going
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:50.640]   to work. If you're a farmer, you probably have a big payday in the fall when you sell
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.720]   your crops or your cattle into the market. If you sell jumbo jets for Boeing, your sales
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:02.160]   cycle is probably extremely slow and extremely lengthy. No matter what you're doing, the
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.240]   world doesn't have the capacity or need for jumbo jets such that you can sell one every
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:13.240]   day or such that you can sell – Joe Gerard, if he sold 1,200 in a year divided by 365,
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:16.520]   he sold three and a half cars a day. You're probably not going to sell three and a half
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:21.800]   jumbo jets a day. But you should still look for consistency in your income. So if you
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.560]   look for it, you might be able to create it. So look at the market around you and see what
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:33.560]   other people do. That's why landscapers shovel snow in winter and mow lawns in summer
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:40.800]   so that they have consistency and continuity of income.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:45.080]   A farmer who focuses and says, "I'm tired of being paid just every year," can build
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:50.400]   out a business model to create year-round cash flow. So compare the business model of
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:57.400]   a guy who is running thousands of acres of corn in Iowa and basically he has a payday
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:02.640]   twice a year. He has a payday when he gets his subsidies and he gets a payday when he
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.880]   sells his corn into the market. That's it.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:11.360]   Now compare that to somebody like Joel Salatin who's kind of the hero of the local farmer
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:17.760]   movement. Joel Salatin has dozens and dozens of businesses that operate on his farm. Amazing.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.640]   All of them create revenue and all of them are all kinds of different times of year.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.760]   So he has consistent income all year round. And he's built the marketing empire around
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.920]   that such that he can pick and choose what he's doing and what he's selling into. That's
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:35.860]   business. That's what all of us need to be doing is creating all kinds of services, marketing
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:41.020]   them effectively to build demand for them, and then profiting off of them.
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:44.720]   So a farmer doesn't have to sit back and say, "I'm just going to get my cash flow in the
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:50.480]   fall and then spend the rest of the year." You can create year-round cash flow. Now,
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:53.720]   it may be some of those may be every year. Joel Salatin, I think he has a buyer's club.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.440]   He has books that he's selling. He has all kinds of different things but some of his
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:04.440]   businesses will be only every couple of months. Here's the season when his chickens are ready
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.800]   and they're grown and he's ready to sell them into the market. Eggs might be for a longer
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.480]   season but maybe larger chickens are a smaller season.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.760]   So you build that out and you look at your business and analyze it. So here are some
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:18.560]   ideas in the video business. I've never been in the video business so it could be that
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.440]   I don't have a clue. That's why I'm saying go find the people who do. But here are just
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:25.720]   a bunch of ideas I made up off the top of my head. Let's say you're a wedding videographer
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.600]   and that's your core reason. So for some reason, it's either feast or famine for you. You're
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.920]   either working every day or you're not working for a month at a time.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:41.920]   What you need is you need some kind of non-correlating income streams and a non-correlating asset
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.380]   class. Here's how we're applying the principles of investing and asset allocation to a business.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:50.760]   So maybe that's corporate work. So I'm making this up to illustrate the point. Don't get
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.400]   bogged down in details but maybe all of your weddings are in the summertime. So in the
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:58.400]   summertime, you're working every single day. But in the winter, you're empty. Well, maybe
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:03.200]   all the corporate meetings in your town are in the wintertime or the corporate conferences.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.540]   So you can go and do the video work there. Or maybe what you find is that there are no
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:11.320]   corporate conferences or corporate meetings that you can videotape in your town but there's
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:17.400]   a lot of editing work. So you can set up a scenario with somebody in Florida where all
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:21.520]   of the conventions that happen in Florida seem to happen in Orlando for some strange
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.400]   reason and they seem to happen in the wintertime for some strange reason.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:29.160]   Well, guess what? People, the business executives in Chicago want to get out of town and they
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.200]   want to take their families and go to Disney World. So now you've got a dry winter so you
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:38.880]   build a business doing freelancing editing work instead of videotaping. That builds out
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.560]   your winter income. Maybe it's the other way around. All your business is in the winter
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.760]   and nothing is in the summer. So you say, "Maybe I can build a business niche out of
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:53.520]   making beautiful sales videos for high-end real estate listings and high-end real estate
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:58.960]   agents." Not just the ho-hum, the $50,000 houses for sale. Maybe it's the 500,000 or
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.480]   the million-dollar houses and you can do that for a few hundred bucks.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.800]   Man, if I'm selling a million-dollar house, I don't know what your real estate commissions
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:12.240]   are in Canada but in the US it's about 3%. If I'm selling a million-dollar house and
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:18.680]   I'm going to have about a $30,000 commission, a 3% commission before broker's fees and all
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:25.280]   that come out, I can spend 500 bucks on a beautiful video that will really enhance my
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:32.280]   property. Maybe that's the thing that works in the summer.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:37.400]   So you build out a little business doing that. You get some marketing built and you get a
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:41.480]   client base of real estate agents that love you and refer you. Now you look at that and
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.920]   you say, "What's another area?" Everyone is taking movies with their phones constantly
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.280]   but nobody has the time to sit down and create something special off of them.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:55.640]   Maybe another business niche is I'm going to edit home movies for the middle class and
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:00.760]   piece together all of the clips of film that are on their iPhones and create that into
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:07.320]   a business and market that because filming is easy and editing is not. People need Christmas
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:11.200]   presents for their families and it's hard to figure out what to buy a mom who has everything
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.800]   in the world that she could ever need but she would love a video.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:20.720]   You market that to busy middle class or mass affluent clients who just want to do that
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:26.280]   and you say, "Send me, upload all your files off of your iPhone into this Dropbox account
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:29.920]   and I'll edit it together." You do a little bit of post-production magic and create this
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.960]   beautiful film and you charge them 500 bucks for it.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:36.520]   It probably doesn't take you that long. You could charge a really nice premium off it.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:40.880]   You can maybe hire some of your video work done externally, the upfront editing, and
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:45.240]   you just add the final tweaks and now you've created a business that is active around the
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:50.640]   holidays or is marketed for Valentine's Day. You know, "Okay, I need Christmas work and
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:57.640]   I need Valentine's Day work," and you build this out and that's an opportunity for you.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.240]   So you're building out and saying, "Here's when it's famine so how can I build a business
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.960]   that's going to bring it in?"
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:09.080]   Maybe you can figure out how to build a stream of consistent income by hiring out editing
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:14.400]   services to some prominent YouTubers or better yet, here's an idea, find some local businesses
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.400]   and help them understand and implement new media and strike a deal with them where you
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.440]   do the upfront work but then you get a percentage of the increased sales that come from it.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:27.640]   So now you want consistency and you find a stable of 20 local businesses, all of whom
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:33.480]   you're going to help and create a weekly or bi-weekly YouTube video for their marketing
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.120]   platform that's going to be well done but they don't have to deal with it.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:42.240]   I desperately want to do video for Radical Personal Finance. I desperately want to do
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:46.480]   it. I think it would be really great. I haven't learned the skills yet but I would love to
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:52.200]   do it. I don't have the space in my day to do it. I would love to walk into a studio,
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.880]   shoot the content and somehow split that business opportunity with a partner. No one's approached
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:02.800]   me with that and I bet there's people in your town who if you approach them could do that.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.320]   There's a big – the stuff that seems easy to you is incredibly daunting and overwhelming
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:10.960]   to other people. So maybe you're great at creating the productions but you're bad at
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:16.760]   the content. I'm brilliant at creating content. I have no shortage of content ideas. I just
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:20.440]   don't have the bandwidth yet. I haven't made it. I'm making it but I don't have
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.720]   the bandwidth to create it.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.400]   So you pick one of those and if those aren't good ideas – I have no idea if they're
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.280]   not. I haven't tested them. I made them all up off the top of my head but if those
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:34.840]   aren't good ideas then figure out a good idea that is and implement it. Then maybe
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:39.320]   here's your real consistent income is you create a – you sell the course. You create
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:44.680]   a continuity product of some time where you're building a course and maybe your vision is
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:49.060]   you get really successful with taking those iPhone clips off of people's phones and
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:53.760]   charging them $299 to create a home movie for mom for Christmas.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:59.200]   Now you take that and you teach local home educated kids how – Kennedy probably don't
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:05.520]   have those. You teach local high school kids how to do this themselves and now they can
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:09.600]   do this on a Saturday once a week and they can make $300 in a Saturday. That's a lot
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.600]   better than wasting their time working down at the local fast food franchise for minimum
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:21.400]   wage or maybe you master the real estate agent video marketing scenario and you can sell
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:26.760]   a high priced course teaching other people how to replicate that business idea or have
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.960]   a membership side of some kind.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:34.740]   So those are just hopefully things that will spark you to figure out what is it actually
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:38.560]   in your business and again, none of those are market tested ideas. I just made them
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:45.020]   all up but that type of thinking I think will get you closer and the simplest way to handle
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:50.900]   the problems created with your inconsistent and irregular income is going to be to create
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:56.520]   regular and consistent income that's ample and in excess of what you need for your expenses.
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:01.040]   It might sound a little silly but that is the answer to your problem.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:06.520]   Now as far as how to actually change and create a budgeting system to handle the irregular
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:12.960]   income, that's tough. It's probably simple but it's not necessarily easy and I've
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:18.320]   struggled with this for years myself. So when you – because I've had inconsistent and
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:23.880]   irregular income for – ever since I was laid off from the corporate job that I had
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:27.240]   before and got into the financial planning business.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:32.680]   And so it's very difficult to so-called budget under this kind of scenario. Now you
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:35.640]   may have to prioritize and say, "Okay, sometimes I'm going to pay this and not,"
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:38.640]   but it's very difficult to do this idea of monthly budgeting. "All right, now I'm
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:42.040]   going to spend $3,000 next month and so I'm going to write it all down and end up with
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.920]   zero and have a zero-based budget." It's a great idea if you make $3,000 a month but
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:50.680]   what if you make $30,000 in one month and then nothing for the next four and then $15,000
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:55.520]   and then nothing for the next 13 months. So that's why I spend so much time on the other.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.720]   That's the bigger problem and more challenging.
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.640]   Now the only way I've been able to solve this problem is with a buffer account and
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:05.880]   I think you need a buffer account if your income is inconsistent and irregular. You
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:10.160]   need a buffer account with lots of money in it and that's more important to your actual
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:15.760]   ability to execute on ideas than any of your long-term investment dollars, than any of
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:20.240]   your long-term IRA dollars, things like that. You need a lot of money just in savings accounts
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:24.880]   and it helps if you can have or develop a sense of timing with regard to your income
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:30.720]   to actually know when it will come in. If I earn $0 this month, $30,000 the next month,
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:35.360]   zero for the next three and then $11,000 and then zero for the next 18 months, that is
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.760]   very difficult to plan around.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:42.320]   But if I know that, "Okay, I've got some history now and yes, there's a cycle where
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.760]   my income is down and my business is down during the winter months but it comes back
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:50.880]   during the summer months. Now I can plan," is what farmers do. Farmers are usually – they're
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:55.040]   planning based upon the depth of their bank loan. I come from a family of farmers. They're
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:58.680]   usually planning based upon the depth of their bank loan. My grandfather always had a sign
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:08.480]   on his wall. He said – this is a non-profit enterprise. He said, "Taxes and banks keep
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:17.000]   it such," I think, something like that, a very empowering message. I got waylaid.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.720]   So the point is that if you know, "Okay, I'm going to make – here's my income.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:23.360]   We're going to sell our crops and we're probably going to have a half a million dollars
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:26.040]   of income," then you sit down and you budget out the coming year.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:30.000]   But every farmer I've ever met and done work with, you need a lot of money in the
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.960]   cash and cash just to fund those things. That's about the only way I know to do it. So if
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:39.640]   you know the cycles, then you can figure out what's the real amount of money. But I think
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:43.600]   you just simply need deeper savings accounts than many other people. You need accurate
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:47.800]   records of what you're actually spending and so that you can have a sense of what does
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:52.600]   $30,000 in the bank mean. Does that mean three months of expenses or does that mean 30 months
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:56.640]   of expenses? Big difference between your planning in those two scenarios.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.160]   You need to have an idea of a buffer amount that you're focusing on and that would be
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:05.600]   different for every industry and every situation. Maybe you need three months of cash in the
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:12.640]   bank and maybe you need three years, very much dependent on what your expectations are.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:16.800]   If you can find a way to budget off of your steady income, that would be awesome. So let's
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:23.280]   say that all of your expenses are from your fiancé's income and you budget based upon
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:29.640]   that. But all of your extra fun and all of your real investments are from your income.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:34.540]   That would be really, really great. What I have worked towards is my goal and I almost
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:38.200]   hit it before I left the firm I was with. But my goal was to get to the point where
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:43.120]   I could always budget from my renewals and my residual income from my investment accounts.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:48.320]   So instead of ever relying on new commissions, which can come in in big chunks and be some
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:53.440]   consistent and some are not, then I could focus on, "Okay, I've got this level of base
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:57.840]   and I'll always budget off of that and save all of the new commissions." So then over
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.760]   time that was my very simple guidelines of how I would be able to make sure that I was
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:08.200]   always saving a lot of money but I was still increasing my lifestyle to a certain point
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:11.200]   where I didn't feel like I was just starving all the time.
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:15.040]   Then in the early years I was focusing heavily on that, "How do I create more business
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:19.580]   so that I can get enough upfront commissions coming in until the renewals and the residuals
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:22.880]   and the size of the investment portfolios that I was managing got to the point where
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:29.280]   I could run my lifestyle off of that?" So now, under a different scenario, now my focus
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:35.080]   is to budget based upon my consulting income and the membership side income and my goal
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:40.880]   is to build that as the foundation of my business so that I can budget off of that regular income
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:47.080]   and then have different one-off business projects be the big, big money that I can save off
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.760]   of that I can invest off of.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:55.080]   Again, this is all relative to scale. If I'm making $2,000 of residual income and my expenses
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:24:02.080]   are $5,000, I can't do that. I got to be making big chunks. But if I'm making $20,000 of residual
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:07.600]   income then maybe I'll go ahead and just keep living on five or ten and save half of it.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:12.200]   So this is all relative. Hopefully you get the concept and the idea and then you've got
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:14.400]   to figure out what to do.
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.160]   The last piece of advice I would have for you in this situation is keep your fixed expenses
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:25.040]   and your fixed obligations low and your margin high. You can get away with living close to
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:30.400]   the edge if you have regular income. Many people do. If you have a nice regular income
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.560]   that's a very consistent paycheck, you can go ahead and you can max your life out. You
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:41.520]   can borrow a bunch of money. You can do well. But you can't if you have irregular income
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.000]   and expect to keep your business going.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:50.200]   The number one cause of business failure is usually cash flow problems. Kind of self-evident,
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:55.560]   right? If businesses fail because they run out of money which means there's some extra
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:59.840]   problems. Is the problem a lack of sales or is the problem expenses too high or what?
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:05.840]   But the problem is cash flow management. So if you can keep fixed expenses down then you
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:12.840]   can have a bit more margin. I could not be doing what I'm doing now if I had an extremely
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:18.080]   high fixed cost lifestyle. I've told you all how much money I make off the show so
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:24.200]   far. It's not enough to support my lifestyle. But it's a long way away from the $5,000
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:29.180]   or $6,000 I need gross of business expenses to support my lifestyle. It's a big difference
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:34.280]   between creating $5,000 a month versus $15,000 a month in the short term.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:39.000]   So then in the early years while I invest and build a business, in the early years that
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.520]   will compound later on down the road and I'll have more flexibility. But those are some
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:47.480]   thoughts that I have. I hope that's helpful to you, Brendan. That's the best guess I have
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:51.920]   and you'll have to figure out and take that and interpret it for your situation. As with
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:55.960]   all financial advice, this really is the big deal. As with all financial advice, you have
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:00.400]   to figure out how to apply this and interpret it to your situation. Everything, you hear
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:06.040]   these things, the details of your situation are fact dependent. That's a big deal. They're
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:11.240]   fact dependent. There's a big difference between somebody saying, give you an example. I did
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:15.000]   planning work for one time for an attorney and he's at variable income. I asked him,
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.880]   how much money do you make? He said, it varies. Some years, last year it was $3.5 million.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:24.800]   This year it's looking like a $1.2 million. He says it kind of wanders around next year.
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:30.520]   I don't know. But he was winning big cases and so the income was extremely variable.
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:37.320]   Now, is it such a big deal to be budgeting if your income is between $1.2 million and
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:42.520]   $3.5 million? Well, if you're spending $2 million every year, then it's a big deal.
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:49.160]   But thankfully, this guy wasn't. He was spending a few hundred thousand. He was certainly living
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:53.760]   fine. But it's not a big deal for him if it's between $1 million this year and $5 million
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:59.040]   the next year. So the question is not just about irregular income. The question is, what's
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:03.000]   the scale? What is the actual scenario? What's the irregularity? So that's why I have to
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.520]   spend all this time talking about concepts and ideas and hopefully this has been helpful
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:12.560]   to you. So that's today's show. I'm sorry the show will be going out late, substantially
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:15.760]   late. It's still in line. It's just, well, we'll get into that another time as far as
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:20.280]   the reasons. I'm still learning my own business and then learning how to buffer for the details
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:23.920]   of life and the details of life have been challenging the last few days. But here it
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:27.800]   is and I hope it's been helpful to you. If you would like to get your questions answered
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:31.840]   on a show like this, feel free to email them to me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com. And
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:36.440]   then I do always give priority to the patrons of the show. So if you email me, one thing
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:40.800]   I check actually, but the names, but it would be helpful to me if you email me a question,
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.720]   just make a note if you're a patron or not. And that way I'll just be able to more easily
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:50.600]   prioritize and make sure that I'm prioritizing those of you who are patrons. And if you want
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:55.280]   to find out and become a patron, check out all the benefits at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:02.600]   I've got a bunch of things there set up for you and hopefully you can benefit. But we're
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:08.040]   doing well, but we're working hard to get to 6,000 a month of income for the show by
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:12.720]   June 1. And if we can do that, I can keep the show commercial free for you. So that's
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.280]   it. I'm out of here. Have a great weekend. Have a great day. Bye.
