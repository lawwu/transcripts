[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   - I think something a lot of people struggle with is
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.900]   what's a reasonable amount?
[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.640]   How do you know that you're saving a reasonable amount
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.200]   and not spending too much?
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.760]   - This is the hard part with retirement planning in general
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.340]   because you don't know what inflation is going to be
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.320]   in the future, what financial market returns are gonna be,
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.040]   what interest rates are going to be,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.240]   how your income is going to change over time,
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.680]   if any other life events are going to impact you.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.880]   You have this savings rate you think
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.720]   is going to be there forever,
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.640]   but then you need to take those savings
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.080]   and use them for something 'cause life gets in the way.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.560]   I think then you kind of turn the dials up
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.800]   depending on how well things are going for you.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.600]   Personal finance, people always talk about lifestyle creep.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.320]   This is the biggest enemy is lifestyle creep.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.920]   As you make more money and your career progresses,
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.440]   I think you should introduce a little lifestyle creep,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.960]   but have the savings creep up too, right?
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.240]   So have it be a certain percentage of your income.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.920]   So if your income goes up
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.920]   and you're still saving a similar percentage,
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.660]   your savings will go up as well, right?
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.800]   So your spending and your savings
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.480]   should both go up commensurately.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.960]   I think that's a good way to give yourself some benefits
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.080]   of your fruits of your labor,
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.880]   but also increasing the savings over time.
