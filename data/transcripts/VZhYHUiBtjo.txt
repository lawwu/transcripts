[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900]   - And you have this fundamental vision of optimism.
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.840]   You call yourself an optimist.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.600]   I mean, in this world, I have a sort of,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.880]   I see myself a little bit as the main character
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.800]   from "The Idiot" by Dostoevsky,
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.540]   who is also kind of seen by society as a fool
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.800]   because he was optimistic.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.700]   So, one, can you maybe articulate
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.040]   where that sense of optimism comes from
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.740]   and maybe also try to articulate your vision
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.320]   of the future where people are inspired,
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.960]   where optimism drives us?
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.640]   It's easy to forget that when you look at social media
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.520]   and so on, where toxicity and negativity
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.520]   can often get more likes,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.720]   that optimism has a sort of a beauty to it.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.520]   And I do hope it's out there.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.720]   So, can you try to articulate that vision?
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.760]   - Yeah, so, I mean, for me, optimism and being an optimist
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.160]   is just seeing the silver lining in every cloud.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.700]   You know, even in tragedy, it brings people together.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.100]   And the question is, can we see that?
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.260]   Can you see the beauty that is in everything?
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.860]   I don't think optimism is foolishness.
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.400]   I don't think optimism is blindness,
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.420]   though it probably involves some naivete,
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.140]   the belief that things will get better,
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.920]   the belief that we tend towards the good,
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.400]   even in times of struggle or bad.
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.620]   You know, you can't sustain war, but you can sustain peace.
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.060]   You know, I think things that are stable
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.180]   are more sustainable, things that are optimistic
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.520]   are more sustainable than things that are chaotic.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.260]   - So you see people as fundamentally good.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.940]   I mean, some people may disagree
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.860]   that you can sustain peace, you can't sustain war.
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.940]   - I mean, you don't have to, I think war is costly.
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.740]   You know, it involves life and money,
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.900]   and peace does not involve those things.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.180]   It requires work.
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.140]   I'm not saying it doesn't require work,
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.540]   but it doesn't drain resources,
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.660]   I think, the same way that war does.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.460]   - You know, the people that would say
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.940]   that we will always have war,
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.260]   and I just talked to the historian of Stalin,
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.420]   is, you know, would say that conflict
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.300]   and the desire for power and conflict
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.940]   is central to human nature.
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.260]   - I concur.
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.340]   - But something in your words also,
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.520]   perhaps it's the naive aspect that I also share,
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.860]   is that you have an optimism
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.300]   that people are fundamentally good.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.460]   - I'm an idealist, you know,
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.860]   and I think idealism is good.
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.220]   I'm not a fool to believe that the ideals
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.860]   that I imagine can come true.
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.900]   Of course there'll never be world peace,
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.220]   but shouldn't we die trying?
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.580]   You know, I think that's the whole point.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.620]   That's the whole point of vision.
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.980]   Vision should be idealistic,
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.920]   and it should be, for all practical purposes, impossible.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.820]   But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try,
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.340]   and it's the milestones that we reach
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.660]   that take us closer to that ideal
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.820]   that make us feel that our life and our work have meaning,
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.860]   and we're contributing to something bigger than ourselves.
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.660]   You know, just because it's impossible
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.160]   doesn't mean we shouldn't try.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.120]   As I said, we're still moving the ball down the field.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.540]   We're still making progress.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.080]   Things are still getting better,
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.680]   even if we never get to that ideal state.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.940]   So I think idealism is a good thing.
