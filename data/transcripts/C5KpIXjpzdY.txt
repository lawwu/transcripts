[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.880]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.560]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.520]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.040]   My guest today is Dr. Zachary Knight.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.460]   Dr. Zachary Knight is a professor of physiology
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.040]   at the University of California, San Francisco,
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.600]   and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.080]   For those of you that don't know,
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.320]   Howard Hughes Medical Investigators are selected
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.400]   from an extremely competitive pool of applicants
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.160]   and have to renew in order to maintain
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.400]   their investigatorship with the Howard Hughes
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.380]   Medical Institute every five years or so,
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.680]   placing him in the most elite of categories
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.040]   with respect to research scientists.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.560]   His laboratory focuses on homeostasis,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.760]   in particular, what drives our sense of hunger,
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.560]   what drives our sense of thirst,
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.680]   and what controls thermoregulation,
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.120]   which is the ability to maintain body temperature
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.240]   within a specific safe range.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.360]   Today, we mainly focus on hunger.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.000]   Dr. Zachary Knight explains the biological mechanisms
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.080]   for craving food, for consuming food,
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.440]   and believe it or not, you have brain circuits
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.520]   that actually determine how much you're likely to eat
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.980]   even before you take your very first bite.
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.160]   And he explains the biological mechanisms for satiety,
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.520]   that is the sense that one has had enough
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.560]   of a particular food or food group.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.120]   Dr. Knight also explains the role of dopamine
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.280]   in food craving and consumption,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.000]   which I think everybody will find very surprising
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.280]   because it runs countercurrent
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.760]   to most people's understanding of what dopamine does
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.600]   in the context of eating and other cravings.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.000]   Today's discussion also includes a deep dive
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.800]   into GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide,
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.120]   and the novel class of drugs such as Ozempic and Monjaro
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.500]   and other related compounds that are now widespread in use
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.820]   for the reduction in body weight.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.680]   Dr. Knight explains how GLP-1 was first discovered
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.360]   and how these drugs were developed, how they work,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.440]   and importantly, why they work,
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.240]   and how that is leading to the next generation
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.280]   of so-called diet drugs or drugs to treat obesity,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.400]   diabetes, and related syndromes.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.220]   We also discussed thirst and the intimate relationship
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.640]   between water consumption and food consumption.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.060]   And we also talk about the relationship
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.680]   between sodium intake, water intake, and food intake.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.980]   By the end of today's conversation,
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.260]   you will have learned a tremendous amount
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.960]   about the modern understanding
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.280]   of hunger, thirst, and salt intake,
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.380]   as well as this modern class of drugs,
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.480]   such as Ozempic and related compounds,
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.640]   all from a truly world-class investigator
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.080]   in the subjects of researching hunger,
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.140]   thirst, and thermal regulation.
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.960]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.400]   that this podcast is separate
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.640]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.540]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.640]   to bring zero-cost to consumer information
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.840]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.120]   to the general public.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.200]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.080]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.460]   Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.260]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.860]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.140]   I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.700]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.520]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in high school,
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.140]   but quickly I realized that therapy
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.060]   is an extremely important component to our overall health.
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.020]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.060]   as important as getting regular cardiovascular exercise
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.580]   and resistance training,
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.900]   which, of course, I also do every week.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.600]   Now, there are essentially three things
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.160]   that great therapy provides.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.180]   First of all, it requires that you have
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.940]   a really good rapport with the therapist,
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.860]   somebody that you can trust and talk to
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.980]   about what's really going on in your life.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.460]   And of course, an excellent therapist
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.380]   will provide you support in moving towards the things
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.060]   that are going to grow your life in the best ways.
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.460]   And third, and this is the one that people often overlook,
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.640]   an expert therapist is somebody
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.140]   who can really provide you useful insights
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.220]   that would not otherwise be obvious to you.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.740]   With BetterHelp, they make it very easy
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.740]   to find the therapist with whom you can have
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.940]   those three essential and highly effective components.
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.240]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.020]   you can go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.040]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.100]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.420]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.140]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.000]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.460]   Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.900]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.980]   of quality sleep each night.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.380]   One of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.900]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.300]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.340]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.780]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.460]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.540]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.420]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.380]   Eight Sleep makes it incredibly easy
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.880]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.620]   by allowing you to program the temperature
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.820]   of your mattress cover at the beginning, middle,
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.100]   and end of the night.
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.980]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.620]   for well over three years now,
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.860]   and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.100]   Eight Sleep recently launched
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.540]   their newest generation pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.420]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.580]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.740]   and it also has snoring detection
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.020]   that remarkably will automatically lift your head
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.140]   a few degrees to improve your airflow
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.260]   and stop your snoring.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.260]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.420]   to save $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.380]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.700]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.220]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.440]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.980]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.420]   that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs,
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.800]   mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and more.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.660]   I started practicing meditation when I was about 15 years
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.740]   old, and it made a profound impact on my life.
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.100]   And by now, there are thousands
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.460]   of quality peer-reviewed studies that emphasize
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.940]   how useful mindfulness meditation can be
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.660]   for improving our focus, managing stress and anxiety,
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.960]   improving our mood, and much more.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.260]   In recent years, I started using the Waking Up app
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.720]   for my meditations because I find it to be a terrific
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.180]   resource for allowing me to really be consistent
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.980]   with my meditation practice.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.940]   Many people start a meditation practice
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.380]   and experience some benefits,
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.140]   but many people also have challenges
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.780]   keeping up with that practice.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.300]   What I and so many other people love
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.380]   about the Waking Up app is that it has a lot
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.140]   of different meditations to choose from,
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.680]   and those meditations are of different durations.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.260]   So it makes it very easy to keep up
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.780]   with your meditation practice,
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.680]   both from the perspective of novelty.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.380]   You never get tired of those meditations.
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.940]   There's always something new to explore
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.180]   and to learn about yourself
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.620]   and about the effectiveness of meditation.
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.300]   And you can always fit meditation into your schedule,
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.100]   even if you only have two or three minutes per day
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.220]   in which to meditate.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.860]   I also really like doing yoga nidra
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.260]   or what is sometimes called non-sleep deep rest
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.820]   for about 10 or 20 minutes,
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.060]   because it is a great way to restore mental
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.260]   and physical vigor without the tiredness
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.700]   that some people experience when they wake up
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.980]   from a conventional nap.
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.520]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.380]   please go to wakingup.com/huberman,
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.460]   where you can access a free 30-day trial.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.340]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.500]   to access a free 30-day trial.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.900]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Zachary Knight.
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.860]   Dr. Zachary Knight, welcome.
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.420]   - Great to be here.
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.580]   - Today, we're going to talk about hunger, appetite, thirst,
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.100]   other motivated behaviors, the role of dopamine,
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.940]   the vagus nerve.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.620]   These are terms and topics
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.860]   that a lot of people hear nowadays,
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.020]   and for which there's a ton of interest.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.200]   But just to march us in sequentially,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.940]   could you describe some of what's happening in the brain
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.940]   and/or body as we get hungry, decide what to eat,
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.500]   and then decide that we've had enough to eat?
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.700]   I think most people just assume that,
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.180]   okay, that my stomach's full, is what we say.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.120]   I've had enough.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.060]   Or we self-regulate it for some other reason,
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.740]   caloric restriction or monitoring in some cases.
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.640]   What's happening in the brain in terms of the circuitries?
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.980]   And what have you discovered
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.220]   about what that process looks like
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.860]   in terms of its kind of universality across people?
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.660]   And then maybe how it sometimes differs between people.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.940]   - Okay, well, there's a lot in that that I'll try to unpack.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.420]   - And I can remind you of some of the nuances.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.620]   In other words, as a biologist, as a neuroscientist,
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.600]   how do you think about this thing
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.620]   that we call hunger and feeding?
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.860]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.060]   So I think at a very high level,
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.380]   a good way to think about the regulation of food intake
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.300]   by the brain is that there's two systems,
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.900]   a short-term system and a long-term system,
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.740]   that are primarily localized
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.460]   to different parts of the brain,
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.740]   operate on different timescales,
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.000]   one on the timescale of a meal, so 10, 20 minutes,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.380]   and the other on the timescale of sort of weeks
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.740]   to months to years and tracks levels of body fat.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.180]   And these two systems sort of interact
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.500]   so that these short-term behaviors we do eating
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.760]   are matched to our long-term need for energy.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   And so I think one of the initial experiments
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.860]   that really led to this idea
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.460]   is this great experiment by Harvey Grill
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.220]   about 50 years ago.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.940]   It's called the decerebrate rat.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.000]   And so essentially what he did was he made a cut
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.840]   in the rat brain.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.660]   So he took these rats in the lab,
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.740]   made a cut so that he separated the brainstem,
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.260]   so the most posterior part of the brain,
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.300]   from the entire forebrain.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.060]   Basically got rid of 80% of the rat's brain.
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.420]   So basically creating these zombie rats,
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.980]   all they have is a brainstem,
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.260]   and asked what can these rats still do?
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.180]   And as you might imagine,
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.140]   they can't do a lot of things, right?
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.860]   Because they basically have lost most of their brain.
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.980]   But he discovered that one thing they can still do
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.780]   is regulate the size of a meal.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.620]   And so--
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.380]   - A very informative experiment.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.660]   - And so, and you have to be careful
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.500]   how we talk about this,
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.340]   'cause the way this meal works
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.260]   is you have to actually put food into their mouth,
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.160]   and then they'll swallow it as you put food
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.000]   into their mouth.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.340]   But eventually at some point,
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.700]   they'll start spitting it out.
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.300]   And that basically is an indication
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.180]   that in some sense, they're becoming sated.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.900]   And they're just using the brainstem that they have left,
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.540]   they're able to sense those signals from the gut
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.740]   and drive the termination of a meal.
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.300]   And he did other experiments showing
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.940]   that many of these signals that come from the gut,
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.700]   gastric stretch, hormones that come from your intestine
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.780]   in response to food intake, like CCK,
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.740]   these desirabate rats just have a brainstem.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.060]   If you inject those or manipulate the gut in those ways,
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.620]   it can, in an appropriate way,
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.120]   change how much the rat eats.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.100]   Now what can't the rat do when it doesn't have a forebrain?
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.540]   The thing it can't do is it can't respond
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.020]   to longer term changes in energy need.
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.700]   Meaning, if you fast the rat for a couple days,
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.380]   this desirabate rat, then start putting food in its mouth,
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.220]   the amount that it eats doesn't change.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.860]   So basically, it doesn't eat a larger meal
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.060]   the way you would if you were fasted for several days
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:46.940]   and then refed.
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.900]   And that experiment along with other evidence
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.580]   has led to the idea that in the brainstem,
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.300]   and then the most posterior part of your brain,
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.980]   there are neural circuits that control sort of a meal.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.260]   And then the timescale of 10 minutes or 20 minutes
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.880]   deciding when a meal should end.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.700]   And in the forebrain, primarily in the hypothalamus,
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.380]   there are neural circuits that then track
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.020]   what is my overall level of energy reserves?
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.180]   What is my level of body fat?
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.700]   Things that would fluctuate on timescales,
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.420]   say days when you're fasting.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.460]   And those forebrain centers feedback
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.300]   to talk to the brainstem and modulate
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.780]   those brainstem circuits that are controlling
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.960]   the size of a meal to sort of match these two timescales.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.540]   So that's at the highest level how I think
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.960]   about the neural circuitry that controls feeding.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.900]   There's obviously a lot more going on underneath that.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.380]   - Fascinating.
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.180]   You mentioned body fat and that somehow the brain
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.260]   is tracking the amount of body fat.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:42.260]   That caught my ear because while it makes total sense,
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260]   I'd like to know how that happens
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.200]   if we happen to know the mechanism.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.020]   And the second question is why body fat
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.780]   and not body fat and muscular mass
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.020]   or body fat and overall body weight?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.320]   What is being signaled between body fat and the brain
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.240]   that allows the brain to track body fat?
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.680]   And why do you think body fat is the critical signal?
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.360]   I realize it represents an energy reserve,
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.800]   but certainly there are other things
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.480]   about the bodily state that are important.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.820]   - Yeah, well, there are certainly other things
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.080]   about the bodily state that are important.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.400]   And there are other things about physiology
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.960]   definitely that are regulated other than body fat.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.500]   But body fat is unique because it represents
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.620]   this energy reserve.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.960]   So the neural circuitry that regulates eating behavior
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.320]   is in some ways very unique
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.000]   because it has this reserve of energy.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.520]   So if you, we also study thirst in my lab and drinking
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.560]   and you don't have a reserve of water in your body, right?
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.600]   And that's true for basically everything else.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.260]   But for fat, we have this reserve of energy.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.040]   And so it's very important that the brain know
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.800]   how much remains and then adjust behavior
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.920]   in coordinates with that so that, you know,
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.680]   you know how urgent it is to get the next meal.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.240]   And so the thought is that the major signal
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.040]   of the level of body fat that we have is leptin.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.800]   It's this hormone.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.800]   It was discovered, it was cloned in 1994,
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.240]   actually by my postdoctoral advisor,
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.720]   a scientist named Jeff Friedman at Rockefeller University,
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.040]   although its history goes back way before 1994.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.520]   So the sort of story behind leptin
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:15.040]   is that there's a facility called Jackson Labs
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.800]   that you I'm sure are familiar with in Maine
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.440]   that since the 1920s has been raising mice
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.720]   and selling them to academics,
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.280]   basically who study physiology and behavior.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.040]   And so they breed thousands of mice.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.080]   So there's sort of a nonprofit organization
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.400]   that distributes mice to the scientific community.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.960]   And at some point in the 1950s,
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.600]   they spontaneously just because they were breeding
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.120]   so many mice, they came across some spontaneous mutations,
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.180]   mutant mice that were extremely fat,
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.580]   like the fattest mice they had ever seen.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.760]   These mice just eat constantly.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.520]   They're just enormous, three times the size
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.960]   of a normal mouse.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.920]   And it's all body fats.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.360]   They're just these huge fat mice.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.440]   And they came across several different mutant strains
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.800]   that all had the same phenotype
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.520]   in the sense that they were all extremely fat,
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.200]   all extremely hyperphagic,
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.400]   but they could tell even in the 1950s
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.360]   that these mutations were on different chromosomes.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.840]   They didn't know anything about how to identify the genes
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.320]   at that point, that was just science fiction,
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.520]   but they knew that there were chromosomes
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.520]   and they were on different chromosomes.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.640]   And so they labeled one obese,
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.840]   one of these mouse strains obese,
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.040]   and the other one diabetes,
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.800]   but they're basically the same.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.760]   As people wonder for a long time,
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.000]   well, what's going on in these mice?
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.040]   Then there was a scientist at Jackson Labs, Doug Coleman,
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.040]   who had the idea, what if we do an experiment
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.240]   where we connect the circulations
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.000]   of these two different strains of obese mice
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.040]   and test the hypothesis
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.920]   that maybe there's a circulating factor,
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.680]   a hormone that is produced by one of these strains
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.840]   and that controls appetite.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.640]   Because at that point, insulin was known,
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.000]   glucagon was known, there were some hormones
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.440]   that were known that were involved in metabolism.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.560]   So it was logical that there could be a hormone
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.600]   that perhaps regulates body fat levels.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.000]   And what they found, which was remarkable,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.600]   when you attach the OB strain to the DB strains,
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.920]   you basically connect their circulation,
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.480]   so hormones are transmitted between the two.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:07.160]   The OB mouse, that strain dramatically loses weight.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.840]   In fact, within a couple of weeks,
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.040]   it looks like a normal mouse.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.560]   It just stops eating, it loses almost all of its body fat,
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.520]   and it essentially in all aspects becomes a normal mouse.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.760]   The DB mouse, nothing really happens.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.880]   It still remains obese, it still remains hyperphagic.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.520]   And based on just that piece of data,
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.640]   Doug Coleman hypothesized that what was going on
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.960]   is these two mutations were mutations
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.700]   in a hormone and a receptor.
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.560]   The OB mouse had a mutation in the hormone
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.760]   that comes from fat, so it couldn't produce this hormone
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.400]   that comes from fat and signals to the brain
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.240]   how much fat you have.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.320]   And the DB mouse has a mutation in the receptor,
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.800]   so it can't sense the hormone.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.920]   And that was just an idea, it was a hypothesis.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.280]   But in the 1980s, as technology advanced,
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.560]   as molecular biology had been invented,
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.240]   it became possible to clone genes.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.120]   A number of people tried to identify
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.080]   what are the genetic mutations that are occurring
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.800]   in these mice that make them so obese.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.200]   And Jeff basically cloned leptin and showed that in fact,
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.440]   Doug was exactly right.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.200]   The OB mutation is a mutation in this hormone, leptin.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.160]   And later, millennium pharmaceuticals showed
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.800]   that the DB mutation is in fact a receptor.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.040]   And it was an important discovery for a couple of reasons.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.920]   One, because this OB gene is just expressed in fat.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.240]   It's exclusively expressed in adipose tissue.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.880]   And how much it's expressed is directly proportional
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.680]   to how much body fat you have.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.760]   So as you gain weight,
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.360]   the expression of this hormone increases in a linear manner,
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.880]   and then it's secreted into the blood.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.640]   So the level of leptin in your blood
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.960]   is a direct readout of your body fat reserves.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.080]   This receptor for leptin, leptin receptor,
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.960]   the functional form of it is expressed
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.000]   almost exclusively in the brain.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And it's expressed in all of the brain regions
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.360]   that we knew from previous work were important for appetite.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.080]   So basically the expression of this receptor
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.400]   gives you a map in the brain
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.360]   of the neurons that control hunger.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.200]   And so what happens is basically when you lose weight,
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.760]   the levels of leptin in your blood fall
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.440]   because basically you've lost adipose tissue.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.080]   The absence of that hormone sends a signal
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.960]   to all these neurons that have leptin receptors in the brain.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.440]   They're not getting that signal that I'm starving.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.800]   And basically that initiates
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.880]   this entire homeostatic response to starvation.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.600]   So a big part of that is obviously increased hunger,
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.520]   but it's also decreased energy expenditure,
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.760]   decreased body temperature, even decreased fertility,
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.880]   because you don't wanna reproduce if you're starving.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.440]   - Less spontaneous movement.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.520]   - Less spontaneous movement, all of this.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.960]   And so the thought is, which I think is absolutely correct,
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.320]   is that this hormone leptin
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.280]   is part of this negative feedback loop
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.080]   from the fat to the brain
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.480]   that basically tells you about your level
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.440]   of body fat reserves and how urgent it is
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.720]   to find the next meal.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.760]   - Fascinating.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.960]   As I recall, Amgen Pharmaceuticals
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.800]   owned the patent for leptin
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.880]   in hopes that it would become the blockbuster diet drug,
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.080]   the logic being that if you were to take this hormone
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.080]   somehow or activate this pathway,
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.640]   that the brain would be tricked into thinking
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.160]   that there was more body fat,
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.680]   more energy reserves than there was,
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.640]   and then people would basically be less hungry,
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.720]   eat less, and lose body fat.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.160]   What happened with that?
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.760]   Do we know why it did not work?
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.560]   - Yeah, so that's a great question.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.200]   So there was a lot of excitement when leptin was cloned
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.800]   'cause it was thought basically we've cured obesity.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.900]   There was an auction for the patent, Amgen won,
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.220]   I think it was something like $20 million up front payment,
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.240]   plus royalties, which at the time was,
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.240]   I mean, it still is a lot of money,
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.080]   but even more money.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.720]   - In other ways, it would be a drop in the ocean
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.800]   compared to what companies
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.400]   will invest into a potential diet drug.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.720]   - Exactly, but at the time,
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.360]   and still a lot of money today,
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.320]   and they did a clinical trial,
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.560]   gave obese people leptin,
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.800]   subcutaneous injections of this hormone,
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.560]   and they didn't lose a lot of weight,
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.080]   and the question was why.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.200]   And so what was subsequently revealed
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.480]   is that the challenge with leptin
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.720]   is that individuals who are obese
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.400]   do not have low levels of leptin for the most part.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.240]   They actually have high levels of leptin,
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.440]   and so what they have is a state of leptin resistance.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.920]   So it's analogous to someone who has type 2 diabetes.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.320]   It's not because they lack insulin,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.940]   it's because they actually have, over time,
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.440]   a high level of insulin,
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.640]   and so target tissue stopped responding to insulin,
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.280]   and the thought is that it's the same way
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.880]   in obesity and leptin.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.800]   Now, subsequently, they went back
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.240]   and did a reanalysis of that clinical trial
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.320]   and asked what if you take all of these people
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.960]   and stratify them according to their starting leptin level.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.000]   So some people have relatively low levels of leptin,
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.660]   some have higher, some have really high levels of leptin,
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.760]   and then ask, if we reanalyze the data,
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.760]   how effective is leptin?
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.620]   And as you might expect,
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.920]   the people with the lowest levels of leptin,
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.880]   they lost the most weight when you gave them this drug,
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.480]   and the people with the highest levels of leptin
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.800]   lost the least weight.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.280]   So there is a rationale there for why,
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.360]   for a scenario in which leptin could work,
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.900]   either among the subset of people
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.920]   who just have, for some reason, lower levels of leptin,
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.680]   these aren't people with mutations like the OB MALS,
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.520]   they have some leptin,
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.560]   they just don't have unusually high levels,
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.080]   or alternatively, after weight loss.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.360]   So after you've lost a lot of weight,
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.540]   your leptin levels plummet, they become very low,
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.800]   and that part of the reason,
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.080]   it's a big part of the reason
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.340]   it's so difficult to keep weight off
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.480]   is because those leptin levels are so low.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.480]   And so it's been thought for a long time
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.680]   that that is a scenario where treating people with leptin
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.680]   could be really useful to help them keep the weight off.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.540]   Why it never made it as a drug for that application,
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.520]   I really don't understand.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.520]   It has something to do, I think,
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.400]   with the pharmaceutical industry, with the economics,
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.200]   with a bunch of other issues
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.960]   that aren't necessarily scientific.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.600]   But I think there's still, in the future,
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.880]   is a possibility that it could come back for that indication,
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.880]   especially now that we have these GLP-1 drugs,
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.360]   and now there's just millions of people losing so much weight
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.560]   and perhaps they want to transition
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.040]   to a different kind of drug to keep the weight off.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.760]   - We are definitely going to talk about GLP-1, Ozempic,
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.440]   and some of the related compounds in a few minutes,
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.020]   but before we do that,
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.800]   I'd love to get to this issue
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.240]   of what's happening in the brain as we get hungry,
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.000]   approach a meal, decide what to eat,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.280]   and decide when we've had enough.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.640]   Are there separate circuitries,
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.960]   or at least separate neurons for each of those steps?
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.000]   And if you would, could you walk us through
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.940]   what that process looks like since we do it every day?
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.040]   Most people do it every day unless they're fasting,
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.640]   multiple times per day.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.400]   What's going on in our brain and body
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.080]   as we think about and approach a meal,
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.280]   consume a meal, and decide enough?
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.720]   - Sure, so there are different neurons
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.920]   that are preferentially involved
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.840]   in different aspects of those processes.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.400]   So I think we often divide feeding behavior
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.700]   and many other kinds of motivated behaviors
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.160]   into appetitive and consummatory phases.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.680]   So appetitive is the phase of the behavior
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.160]   where you're, for example, searching for food.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.040]   It's foraging.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.320]   It's all the actions that lead up
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.560]   to the actual behavior itself,
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.200]   which then we call the consummatory phase.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.040]   That's actually putting the food
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.720]   in your mouth and eating it.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.040]   And the general thought is that these four brain circuits
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.040]   in the hypothalamus are more important,
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.180]   particularly in the hypothalamus,
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.220]   but other parts of the forebrain as well,
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.160]   are more important for the appetitive phase.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.440]   And the brainstem circuits are more important
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.340]   for the consummatory phase,
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.360]   the actual putting it in your mouth
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.420]   and licking, chewing, swallowing, and all of that.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.140]   Within the hypothalamus, there's a population
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.520]   of neurons called AGRP neurons.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.600]   So it's just an acronym, A-G-R-P,
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.760]   and it stands for agouti-related peptide,
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.760]   but it doesn't really matter.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.920]   They're absolutely critical for that appetitive phase,
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.360]   for the searching for food,
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.040]   for the desire to find food
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.740]   and consume it when you're hungry.
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.960]   - Sorry, just to touch on the AGRP neurons
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.880]   and this appetitive phase,
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.800]   are they known to connect to areas of the brain and body
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.800]   that stimulate the desire to move?
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.760]   Because I think about when I get hungry,
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.340]   if I'm at my desk or something,
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.420]   I need to get up and find food.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.500]   I need to walk to lunch or go to the refrigerator.
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.160]   Are they somehow linked to the circuits
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.760]   that promote locomotion?
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.300]   - Well, they have to promote those things,
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.460]   but they're not directly linked to any of those circuits.
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.980]   They're linked directly to other forebrain circuits
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.020]   involved in motivation.
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:14.080]   So the way we think about what these kinds of neurons,
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.620]   like AGRP neurons, are doing,
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.720]   they're not directly talking to the motor circuits
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.300]   to tell you to move your legs or arms
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.020]   to pick up the sandwich or whatever.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.500]   They're rather creating this general problem
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.660]   that the animal has to solve,
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.980]   which is that I'm hungry, I need to get food.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.940]   It would be really great if I could have a sandwich.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.740]   And then the animal uses all of its mental capacities
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.760]   to solve that problem.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.260]   So they're just there to set the goal,
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.020]   not so much to direct the solution.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.740]   But these AGRP neurons,
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.260]   there are a few thousand neurons
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.500]   at the base of the hypothalamus.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.500]   So basically the most ventral,
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.740]   the most bottom part of the forebrain.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.580]   So tiny population of cells,
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.540]   but outsized importance for the control of feeding behavior.
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.300]   So if you stimulate these cells in a mouse or a rat
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.700]   that's not hungry,
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.200]   the animal will voraciously eat like it's starving.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.140]   If you silence these cells, animals will starve to death.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.400]   So you can basically give them food.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.540]   They just won't eat it voluntarily
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.360]   until basically you have to euthanize them
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.480]   because they've lost so much weight.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.380]   And the activity of these AGRP neurons
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.220]   is thought to track the body's need for energy.
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.180]   One reason that's thought
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.220]   is that they express these receptors for leptin,
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.620]   this hormone that I was just talking about
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.740]   that comes from fat
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.160]   and signals the level of body fat reserves.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.340]   And leptin inhibits AGRP neurons.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.980]   So as you might expect, if you have lots of body fat,
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.180]   then a neuron that expresses,
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.000]   that controls hunger should be less active
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.500]   than if you have very little body fat.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.300]   So that's one mechanism by which leptin controls hunger.
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.660]   We in my lab have investigated
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.380]   the role of these AGRP neurons
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.820]   from a slightly different perspective,
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.060]   which is, and this relates to your question
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.620]   about what happens when we approach food,
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.420]   when we start a meal.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.940]   And to ask, what are their activity patterns?
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.640]   What is the natural sort of firing
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.260]   of this population of neurons when an animal eats a meal?
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.900]   It's a very basic question.
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.020]   Something I think we've wanted to know for a long time
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.300]   was not really addressable until about 10 years ago
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.980]   because the technology didn't exist
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.820]   because these are such a tiny population of cells,
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.940]   so deep in the brain.
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.540]   So one of the very first experiments we did in my lab
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.340]   was to investigate that, to ask for the first time
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.380]   what happens to these AGRP neurons when an animal eats.
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.820]   And so one of my first graduate students, Yiming Chen,
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.240]   he used a technology called fiber photometry,
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.940]   which allows us to put a fiber optic into the mouse's brain.
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.820]   So then we could record fluorescence
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.000]   from these AGRP neurons,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.100]   which we could use as a readout of their activity.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.620]   It's basically using a calcium sensor.
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.740]   So calcium is a surrogate for neural activity.
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.980]   And one of the very first experiments he did,
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.300]   he said, let's make the animal hungry.
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.820]   These AGRP neurons will be very active
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.640]   'cause the animal's hungry.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.480]   And then let's give it some food
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.380]   and see what happens during a meal.
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.940]   And our expectation was that these AGRP neurons
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.420]   would gradually decline in activity as the animal eats
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.720]   and levels of hormones in the blood start changing,
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.680]   feeding back to inhibit these neurons.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.060]   What we found was really surprising.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.900]   I remember that when he made this discovery,
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.340]   basically him running into my office and saying,
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.180]   "Zach, I gave the mouse a piece of food,
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.520]   "but the weirdest thing happened.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.220]   "The neurons shut off almost immediately."
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.320]   And I said, "Yiming, you've made a mistake.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.160]   "It's okay.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.340]   "You're just starting off in graduate school.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.180]   "This happens.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.320]   "Go back and repeat the experiment
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.660]   "and then we'll discuss it."
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.500]   But he did several times.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.320]   He said, "You know, Zach,
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.160]   "every single time I do this happens,
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.020]   "I give a hungry mouse food and the AGRP neurons,
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.020]   "within just a few seconds,
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.000]   "their activity has greatly diminished
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.640]   "back to the level it would be in a fed mouse,
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.380]   "even before they take the first bite of food."
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.020]   And so Yiming then went to do a series of experiments,
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.500]   tried to understand what was going on.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.220]   And what he basically showed by changing the kind of food
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.220]   he gave them or the accessibility of the food
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.420]   or how hungry the mouse was
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.420]   and measuring the response of these AGRP neurons
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:53.360]   was that what the neurons were doing was predicting.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.060]   The mouse looks at the food,
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.420]   it looks at how palatable it is,
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.180]   imagines how hungry the mouse is, how accessible it is.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.360]   And then within a few seconds,
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.220]   these neurons predict how much food the mouse is going to eat
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.780]   in the forthcoming meal.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.780]   And so essentially these neurons know
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:06.860]   how much the mouse is going to eat
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.900]   before the mouse even takes the first bite.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.260]   And you can show this by a very simple analysis
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.140]   in which you give the mouse different foods
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.660]   and you look at how much these AGRP neurons drop
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.420]   when the mouse sees and smells the food.
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.260]   And then you plot that against,
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.060]   this drop happens in three seconds, four seconds,
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.020]   something like that.
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.060]   Then you look at how much does the mouse go on to eat
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.020]   in the next 30 minutes.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.200]   You can just draw a straight line.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.780]   So this was one of the first results from my lab
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.100]   and it was really surprising to all of us,
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.560]   and I think everyone.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.900]   But it illustrated a theme
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.400]   that we've now seen again and again,
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.620]   which is that these circuits that control internal state,
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.940]   control things like hunger and thirst,
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.780]   what they're constantly doing is predicting the future.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.820]   They can sense these signals from the body
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.020]   that tell you about what's happened,
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.220]   but those signals are slow.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.980]   And you don't want to wait 20 minutes
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.060]   from the food that you ingested to reach your stomach
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.740]   and then slowly start entering your intestine
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.460]   to figure out what was the nutrient content of the meal.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.260]   You want to try to figure that out as soon as you can, right?
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.020]   And so the animals learn presumably through just experience
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.380]   that, okay, something that smells like this
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.140]   and looks like this, it has about this many calories
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:06.980]   and I know I'm this hungry,
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.260]   I'm gonna eat about this much.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.260]   And then that information is all transmitted
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.540]   to these circuits to start the process of satiation
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.300]   before the meal begins.
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.300]   - Is it satiation or it's ceasing of foraging
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:23.320]   so that the animal, or if I translate to a person,
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.820]   decides, okay, now I'm going to consume this sandwich,
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.020]   this package of food.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.060]   - That's a great question.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.580]   So we don't fully know the answer.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.320]   So one interpretation of the data I just showed you
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.720]   is exactly what you said,
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.760]   is that what these neurons do
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.220]   is they control foraging alone.
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.220]   They don't control eating.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.100]   And so this is perfect.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.900]   You see the food, you know that it's got enough calories,
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.980]   the neurons shut off and then you stay there and eat it.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.100]   You transition from this appetitive
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.420]   to this consummatory phase.
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.540]   But that doesn't seem to be the whole explanation
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.420]   because if you artificially stimulate these neurons,
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.380]   so prevent that drop from ever happening,
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.000]   just stimulate them continually,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.380]   the mouse will just sit there and eat.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.100]   So you can't fully separate,
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.400]   although we'd like to make this distinction
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.740]   between appetitive and consummatory,
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.940]   and we know that in different parts of the brain
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.580]   there's more important for one versus the other,
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.700]   the reality is that the entire behavior is linked
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.780]   and you can't fully separate them.
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.280]   So there's a number of ideas about what this means.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.940]   So one idea that I just mentioned
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.400]   is that starting the process of satiety
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.660]   before the meal begins.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.700]   Another idea which you mentioned,
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.260]   which could be part of the answer,
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.440]   is that it is reducing this appetitive drive
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.900]   and allowing the transition to consummatory behavior.
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.740]   Another idea is that,
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.620]   and I call these ideas
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.020]   because we don't really fully know the answer yet
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.460]   for exactly what the purpose is.
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.520]   In biology it's always hard to answer why something happens.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.580]   You can figure out what does happens,
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.460]   but then you can,
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.860]   the reason why it evolved that way is challenging.
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.180]   Another idea is it's involved in these,
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.460]   what we call cephalic phase responses
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.820]   that are necessary to prepare you for a meal, right?
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.020]   So the famous example, this is Pavlov, right,
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.380]   basically trains the dog to associate the ringing of the bell
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.540]   with the presentation of food,
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.380]   and then eventually the ringing of the bell alone
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.340]   causes the dog to salivate in the absence of any food.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.980]   And salivation is one example of a cephalic phase response.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.540]   The purpose of that is to have enzymes in your mouth
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.860]   that basically are gonna digest the food
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.740]   and get them there right before you need them.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.820]   But there's also some other things,
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.940]   like basically the secretion of insulin occurs
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.820]   in response to food cues,
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.120]   changes in gastric acid, gut motility,
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.460]   all these things are getting ready for the meal to happen.
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.940]   And so another idea is it could be part of that,
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.260]   but probably it's doing all of these things.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.140]   - As many of you know,
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.020]   I've been taking AG1 for more than 10 years now.
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.500]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.220]   To be clear, I don't take AG1
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.260]   because they're a sponsor,
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.380]   rather they are a sponsor because I take AG1.
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.780]   In fact, I take AG1 once and often twice every single day,
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:45.500]   and I've done that since starting way back in 2012.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.060]   There is so much conflicting information out there nowadays
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.260]   about what proper nutrition is.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.220]   But here's what there seems to be a general consensus on.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.560]   Whether you're an omnivore, a carnivore,
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.260]   a vegetarian or a vegan,
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.460]   I think it's generally agreed
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.980]   that you should get most of your food
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:03.000]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.500]   which allows you to eat enough, but not overeat,
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.080]   get plenty of vitamins and minerals,
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.100]   probiotics and micronutrients
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.500]   that we all need for physical and mental health.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.300]   Now, I personally am an omnivore,
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.860]   and I strive to get most of my food
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.660]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.620]   But the reason I still take AG1 once
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.340]   and often twice every day
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.820]   is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins,
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.980]   minerals, probiotics, et cetera,
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.820]   but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.100]   It's basically a nutritional insurance policy
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.800]   meant to augment, not replace quality food.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.000]   So by drinking a serving of AG1 in the morning,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.040]   and again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.680]   I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.380]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1,
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.400]   report feeling much better in a number of important ways,
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.560]   such as energy levels, digestion, sleep, and more.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.000]   So while many supplements out there
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.120]   are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome,
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.880]   AG1 is foundational nutrition
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.080]   designed to support all aspects of wellbeing
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.580]   related to mental health and physical health.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.000]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.440]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.860]   to claim a special offer.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.980]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.600]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.440]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.400]   It's so interesting.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.540]   I have a number of questions,
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:20.360]   but I think the one that I'll put at the top of the list
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.840]   is the other night we were out to dinner in New York
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.920]   and I was very hungry.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.460]   I hadn't eaten much that day
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.400]   and I was looking forward to a nice steak.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.840]   They brought out bread, French bread.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.720]   It was a French restaurant.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.560]   I took one bite.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.540]   I realized it was absolutely delicious French bread.
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.400]   The butter was fantastic.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.600]   And so I had some bread and butter, which I love.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.680]   Then they brought more.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.040]   And then they started bringing out,
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.520]   I don't know who ordered them 'cause I didn't, appetizers.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.140]   And I realized that this was going to be
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:53.400]   a much more extensive calorically dense meal.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.280]   And suddenly my appetite for the appetizers,
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.120]   it sort of went down
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.900]   because I knew there was more food coming.
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.360]   Had I not known that there was more food coming,
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.840]   I think I would have consumed more of the appetizers,
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.160]   which also looked great.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.460]   So clearly there's something going on
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.280]   with these AGRP neurons at the moment.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.600]   You're sort of integrating based on new information.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.440]   - Exactly.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.720]   - On the other end of the spectrum,
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.160]   I did a solo episode about eating disorders
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.920]   and anorexia nervosa in particular.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.840]   And one of the things that I learned from experts
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.240]   in that field, the psychiatrists who work on this
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.920]   and the scientists who work on this,
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:32.920]   is that people with anorexia are unbelievably tuned
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:38.480]   to the caloric content of food.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.400]   That their visual system and presumably other systems
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.400]   have become like almost hyper-accurate calculators
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.340]   of the amount of calories in food.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.260]   They've devoted a lot of cognition to it.
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.140]   It sometimes can border on
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.420]   or be placed within the obsessive realm,
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.560]   but that they see food and they can tell you
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.920]   a tremendous amount about the caloric amounts
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.400]   with these foods, even food combinations,
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.920]   with a very small margin of error.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:14.360]   And that drives in that condition, obviously food avoidance.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.880]   So I have to assume that these AGRP neurons
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.200]   are involved in this kind of thing.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.800]   One represents a regulation,
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.080]   in the case of the example I gave,
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.000]   and in the other case, let's just call it what it is
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.240]   because anorexia nervosa is the most deadly
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.260]   of the psychiatric conditions, sadly,
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:32.300]   a pathologic dysregulation, a maladaptive dysregulation.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.780]   So what is known about these AGRP neurons in humans?
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.460]   Meaning, do they exist in humans?
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:42.780]   Presumably they express the leptin receptor.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.620]   Sounds like they are able to integrate information,
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.200]   both cognitive, based on immediate experience,
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.820]   visual, olfactory, but also a lot of prior experience.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.940]   A hamburger patty,
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.500]   I can't tell you how many calories it has.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.740]   All I know is that it's mostly protein and some fat.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:05.140]   What are these neurons doing?
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.260]   What do they have access to?
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.060]   They sound like, anytime I hear about hypothalamus,
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.160]   I think very basic drives,
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.600]   but you're talking about a pretty sophisticated analysis
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.460]   of a real-time event that is driving
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.760]   fairly nuanced behavioral decisions and updating that,
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.420]   which is a big deal.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.340]   We're both neuroscientists,
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.580]   but for everyone listening and watching,
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:27.440]   this is a big deal.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.360]   This is as nuanced as deciding
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.880]   whether or not somebody is friend or foe
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.160]   or deciding whether or not you like a movie or you don't.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.380]   I mean, this is some pretty sophisticated processing.
[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:41.280]   This isn't eat, don't eat, or eat less, eat more.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.480]   These aren't switches.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.320]   - Exactly.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.240]   - These are dials.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.320]   - Exactly.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.480]   Yeah, so there's a lot there.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.360]   I'll try to unpack that.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.620]   So the first thing I would say is they are present in humans
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:54.680]   and humans have AGRP neurons.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.240]   Human AGRP neurons express the leptin receptor
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.440]   and we think the functions are very similar.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.480]   So one of the nice things actually
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.340]   about studying these kinds of things,
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.960]   like basic mechanisms of hunger, thirst,
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.920]   because these things are so important for survival,
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.600]   they've been under really strong selection, right?
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.040]   And so many of the components of these systems
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.200]   are genetically hardwired,
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.760]   meaning these are cell types that have a single purpose,
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.200]   in this case, to control hunger.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.880]   They're labeled by specific genes
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.980]   and those are conserved through evolution.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:27.040]   We also know that this pathway, this AGRP neuron pathway,
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.960]   is important in humans due to human genetics.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.560]   So just to add a little bit more information here,
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.860]   there's a companion set of neurons called POMC neurons
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.960]   that promotes satiety.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.920]   So there's sort of the yin and yang of hunger.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.400]   AGRP neurons promote hunger.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.400]   POMC neurons promote satiety.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.800]   They're intermingled in the same part of the hypothalamus.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.560]   They're axons that project
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.640]   to the exact same downstream brain regions.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.840]   Then it's thought that these two neurons
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.160]   compete with each other to control appetite.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.760]   And that competition occurs through neuropeptides
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.640]   that they release, one of which is an agonist
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.560]   for a downstream receptor
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.660]   and the other one of which is an antagonist.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:11.600]   We know from human genetics that among severely obese people
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.280]   mutations in this pathway, AGRP, POMC neurons,
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.160]   and their direct downstream targets are quite common.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.000]   - Really?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   So is it fair to say that some amount of obesity is genetic
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.540]   in nature at the level of neuronal firing or circuitry?
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.640]   - I think a lot of body weight regulation is genetic.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.760]   It's highly heritable.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.600]   There's a question of how much of it is due to single genes.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.680]   And the number of people quote,
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.520]   and this is among people who are severely obese.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.320]   So not just people who you've seen someone
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.760]   who's overweight, but people have sort of syndromes
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.200]   where they're very obese from a very young age.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.920]   Among those people, something on the order of 10%
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.940]   have mutations in this pathway.
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:56.040]   And it can either be this hormone POMC
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.840]   or an enzyme within those cells that processes POMC
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.520]   into the right form, or in the downs,
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.920]   and this is the most common mutation
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.800]   in the downstream receptor for POMC,
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.420]   it's called the melanocortin-4 receptor.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.320]   And so among the severely obese,
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.720]   people who have sort of genetically inherited
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.900]   severe obesity from childhood,
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.700]   something on the order of 10% have mutations
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.540]   in this pathway.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.800]   So it's very clear that this pathway is involved
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.720]   in body weight regulation in humans.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.660]   Most obesity, although there is a very strong
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:30.440]   genetic component, is not associated
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.040]   with single gene mutations like this,
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.020]   it's associated with effects of many mutations.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.880]   But we know that even in that sort of polygenic obesity
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.160]   that has many different genetic causes,
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:44.200]   that the brain is important.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.400]   And one of the reasons we know that,
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.320]   so if you look at the genes
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.000]   through genetic association studies
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.320]   that have been associated with body weight,
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.920]   and there's been lots of genetic association studies
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.720]   trying to find mutations that are associated
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.480]   with whether you're lean or obese.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.400]   Something on the order of 1,000 genes
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.200]   have been linked to body weight regulation.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.680]   And the vast majority of those are expressed in the brain.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.360]   They're highly enriched for brain processes,
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.160]   which makes sense because body weight
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.320]   is controlled by food intake, right?
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.160]   And the brain controls behavior,
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.640]   and also the brain controls energy expenditure.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.720]   So maybe it's not so surprising,
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.720]   but it's clear that mutations in genes in the brain
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.760]   are important for body weight,
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.080]   which is consistent with the results of twin studies.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.240]   So if you look at monozygotic versus dizygotic twins,
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.480]   the estimates for the heritability of body weight
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.400]   is something on the order of 80%.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.600]   - We should explain monozygotic, dizygotic,
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.000]   which I've talked about before on the podcast,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.400]   just to brush people off.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.720]   - Just identical versus fraternal twins, basically.
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.040]   And so, and by comparing their,
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.720]   basically their body weight when they become adults,
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.880]   you can get a sense for how much of this
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.000]   is genetic versus environmental.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.280]   And something on the order of 80% is thought to,
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.720]   the variation between individuals
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.160]   is thought to have a genetic component.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.440]   - Wow.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.360]   I don't think most people appreciate that.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.400]   - Yeah, it's- - And a lot of the debate
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.200]   we hear nowadays is because there are things
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.960]   that people can do to lose body fat,
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.400]   exercise, eat differently, et cetera,
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.480]   maybe embrace pharmacology if that's appropriate.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.860]   There seems to be this, to me, silly debate
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.680]   as to whether or not people should be eating better
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   and exercising or assuming that all of the obesity
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:26.680]   they might have arises through genetic causes
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.720]   and therefore take a prescription drug.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.480]   I mean, why wouldn't it be a combination of things?
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:35.600]   Like, to me, it just seems like why wouldn't people embrace
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.240]   some or all of the tools that they could afford
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.200]   and that are safe for them?
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.320]   So, I just want to get that out there
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.440]   because the moment this comes up,
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.040]   people start thinking, "Oh, well,
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.560]   "the moment we assign a genetic source to something,
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.640]   "we're removing personal responsibility."
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.320]   But of course, there are people,
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.280]   I know people who have struggled with their weight
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.120]   their entire lives, for whom some of these new
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.880]   pharmaceuticals like Ozempic have provided them
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.080]   the opportunity to finally be able to lose weight
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.240]   and feel better and exercise safely, for instance.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.880]   - I completely agree with that.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.000]   I think there is a misconception out there about this,
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.040]   about what it means for something
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.040]   to be genetically heritable.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.360]   And I think this gets to the root of why
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.320]   so many people find this sort of hard to believe
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.640]   that there's such a strong genetic component to body weight.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.320]   And that's the idea that if you look at people,
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.280]   say, 75 years ago, they were much leaner, right?
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.240]   And you look at people today and there's been this,
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.080]   starting sometime around the 1970s,
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.440]   there was this explosion in body weight
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.640]   and increase in obesity.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.440]   - Is that when, that's when it started, mid '70s?
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.880]   - Sort of the 1970s is when a lot of that started happening.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.720]   - Snacking.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.360]   - So there's lots of explanations.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.200]   - Seed oil, snacking.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.520]   By the way, I don't think that's the reason, folks.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.780]   I think there are a lot of reasons,
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:43.600]   but the theories that abound right now on social media
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.920]   are, I have a list of theories
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.840]   as to why the obesity is increasing.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.000]   You get everything from seed oils to snacking
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   to smartphones to conspiracies to, it's wild.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.440]   It's wild.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.160]   The range of hypotheses is wild.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.320]   - Yeah, I mean, and the challenges,
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.280]   I mean, some of them could be true,
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.520]   but it's just very hard to test those things experimentally
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.640]   'cause they're happening in the whole population, right?
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.100]   But so I think the thing that people find hard
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:07.940]   to wrap their heads around,
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.520]   because it is a little bit of a confusing idea,
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.600]   is that how can it be that in, say, 50 or 75 years,
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.440]   there's been this explosion in obesity,
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.400]   which is, the environment has changed,
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.280]   but human genetics has not changed in that amount of time.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.760]   It's just not fast enough for people to evolve.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.600]   So it can't be due to mutations in humans.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.400]   - What about devolve?
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.200]   My understanding is that within a species,
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.160]   evolving new traits is very slow.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.000]   - Yes.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.160]   - But mutations arise, like the OB mutation,
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.000]   and then you can get very fat versions
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.920]   of an animal very quickly, right?
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:42.680]   All you need is, if it's a recessive allele,
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.280]   you need two copies, and the next thing you know,
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.900]   you've got a mouse that's four times larger
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.080]   than a typical mouse,
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.080]   and it's all explained by increased body weight.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:52.560]   So that can happen very quickly within a species.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:57.080]   What's rare to find is an entire new branch of a species
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.800]   that has a very, a new adaptive function.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.360]   That seems more rare.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.200]   - So that's true.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.440]   So definitely, there's some things
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.600]   that take longer to evolve than others,
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.600]   but with humans, we're talking about just two generations.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.080]   There just isn't enough time for any evolution
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.560]   of any significance to happen.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.000]   - Baby boomers, right?
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.840]   Generate X. - Generate X.
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:15.660]   - That's new, right?
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.400]   And then whatever is YZ millennial.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.760]   - Exactly. - I lose track after that.
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:19.600]   - Exactly.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.080]   So I think the thing that people find hard
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.320]   to wrap their heads around is how can it be
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.560]   that that increase in body weight
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.920]   is clearly environmental, right?
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.800]   'Cause that's all that's changed is the environment.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.160]   Nothing has changed genetically.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.480]   Yet it's also true what I said,
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.320]   that body weight is extremely heritable.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.440]   It's one of the most heritable features,
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.280]   and something on the order of 80%.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.200]   One of the only things we know about
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.800]   that's actually more heritable than body weight is height.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.560]   Most diseases are not as heritable as body weight.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.400]   How can you explain that?
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.320]   And the idea is this.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.720]   There's a distribution of body weights among people.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.200]   So in any given society at any point in time,
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.560]   some people are gonna be leaner,
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.720]   some people are gonna be more obese.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.200]   That distribution, where you lie on that distribution
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.280]   is determined primarily by genetics.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.600]   So you may be the person who has the thrifty genes,
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.280]   so that basically cause you to save energy,
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.160]   and so you would be more on the obese side.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.640]   Or you may be a person who has different genes
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.080]   that cause you to be a little bit less hungry,
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.640]   so you would be on the leaner side.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.720]   What environment does is then it shifts
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.560]   that whole distribution, so that basically the mean shifts
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.160]   so that everyone becomes, or most people become heavier.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.720]   And so sort of a phrase that people sometimes use
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:26.320]   is that genetics loads the gun
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.960]   and environment pulls the trigger.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.880]   So basically genetics sets your propensity,
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.400]   and then environment can basically unmask that.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.300]   And so as we've had this change in environment
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.340]   where there's all of this,
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.680]   and we don't know exactly what the things are
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.840]   that have changed that are important,
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.400]   but there's all this ultra-processed food,
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.760]   highly palatable food, just various other things
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.780]   that you mentioned, seed oils,
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.280]   who knows if that's important.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:52.520]   Certain people had these latent mutations
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.320]   that made them, say, very sensitive to palatable food.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.840]   And in an earlier time, they may have been lean,
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.700]   but now because they have that latent capacity
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.160]   to be sensitive to ultra-processed food,
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.120]   they now gain tons of weight
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.720]   in the environment that we're in.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.040]   It's still because of genetics,
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.080]   but it also requires the environmental component.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.480]   I mean, just take a step back, right?
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.720]   You can make anyone lean by just putting them in prison
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.240]   and just only feeding them 1,500 calories.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.520]   I mean, we've done those kinds of experiments.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.560]   There's this famous experiment,
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.600]   the Minnesota starvation experiment, right?
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.000]   They basically, they didn't put people in prison,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:22.840]   but this is in World War II.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.160]   They took a bunch of healthy volunteers,
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.560]   fed them 1,600 calories a day,
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.000]   and just asked what would happen
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.400]   if you basically semi-starved people.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.280]   And unsurprisingly, they lose an incredible amount of weight.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.320]   All they think about is food.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.760]   They basically, their body temperature goes down,
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.880]   their heart rate goes down.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.440]   They just become obsessed with food.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.160]   And you could always do that for anyone, right?
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:41.720]   But in a given environment where you're not
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.280]   in that kind of situation,
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.600]   then your propensity to gain weight
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.160]   will be determined by genetics.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.160]   So that's the idea.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.220]   - I very much appreciate that description.
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.880]   And I know a great number of other people will as well,
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:57.200]   because the explanation for the increase in obesity
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.640]   has not been described with that level of accuracy
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.360]   and detail with respect to the interactions
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.200]   between genetics and the environment.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:09.120]   Is it fair to say that what's changed in our environment
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.520]   is the free availability of food?
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.320]   You know, I was walking through an airport yesterday
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:15.680]   and every 20 meters or so,
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.240]   there's a vending machine or a restaurant.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.720]   The cost of calories is fairly low, right?
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.640]   Getting high quality nutritious food
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.760]   that tastes great is expensive, I would argue.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.720]   But getting calories is fairly inexpensive.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.280]   - Yeah, I think that's a plausible hypothesis.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.080]   It's one of several plausible hypotheses
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.040]   and it would be surprising to me if it didn't contribute.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.960]   But the reality is these population level questions
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.240]   are just so hard to actually know
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.880]   because you can't do an experiment, right?
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.840]   We can't create a parallel society
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.240]   where we manipulate one of these variables
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.120]   and see if the people become obese.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.880]   So I think probably the availability of food,
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.920]   the free availability, the low cost is one part of it.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.000]   Another part of it is probably,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.680]   although again, it's not proven,
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.400]   is that these ultra processed foods
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.080]   have a number of features
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.400]   that make people prone to gain weight.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.480]   And there's really beautiful work,
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.320]   I don't know if you know this,
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.480]   from Kevin Hall at the NIH who's investigated this.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.240]   He's really, in my opinion, the best person
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.680]   doing this kind of human obesity research today.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.040]   And he does these experiments
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:20.880]   where he takes people into the NIH, into the hospital,
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.240]   hospitalizes them for several weeks
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.040]   so he can exactly control what they eat.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.600]   And he did this beautiful experiment
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.680]   where basically he had chefs prepare two kinds of food,
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:32.200]   one ultra processed and the other not ultra processed,
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.840]   sort of more whole foods, more healthier foods,
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.080]   but had them take a lot of care
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.640]   so that when they gave the foods to independent raters,
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.480]   to people to test,
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.720]   they would say this is about equally palatable.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.560]   So I like this ultra processed dish
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.800]   as much as this non-ultra processed dish.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.440]   - What's an example of an ultra processed dish?
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:50.600]   Like a out of package macaroni and cheese?
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.440]   - Exactly, that kind of stuff.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.580]   - With bacon kind of thing?
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.420]   - Exactly.
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:55.960]   - Versus some pasta sitting next to a vegetable
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.760]   and a nice piece of salmon or something?
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.240]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:05.200]   And took people into the hospital,
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.720]   basically allowed them to eat
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.360]   just as much as they would like,
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.640]   first of the ultra processed meals.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.760]   So they had the selection of ultra processed meals
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:13.840]   for a couple of weeks
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.880]   and then switch them to the non-ultra processed meals.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.040]   And then also did it in the reverse order.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:18.880]   So the other half of the people,
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.880]   they got the regular food first,
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.640]   then they got the ultra processed food.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.280]   And what he found is that even though
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.320]   people rated the foods as equally palatable,
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.320]   they ate much more of the ultra processed food.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.560]   And they actually gained weight
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:30.640]   during that two week period
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.600]   when they were being given the ultra processed foods.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.660]   And then when you switch them, they lost weight.
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:37.720]   So the idea being that you can have two sets of food
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.560]   that you have equal preferences for,
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.240]   but something about the ultra processed food
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.640]   is making you eat more of it when you actually consume it.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.600]   And there's a number of ideas about why that could be.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.440]   So one idea is that these ultra processed foods
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.680]   have been optimized to have the right percentage of fat
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.640]   and sugar and protein to sort of promote more consumption
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.600]   once you start eating it.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.000]   So that could be part of it.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.640]   Another idea is that a big thing about whole foods
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.800]   is that they take more energy to digest
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.640]   and they have more volume.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.560]   So one of the striking things from that study
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.080]   is if you just look at the pictures of the meals,
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.280]   they're the same number of calories,
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.400]   but there's so much more food seemingly
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.680]   on the non-processed food versus the ultra processed food.
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.400]   And that's just because whole foods are bigger
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.720]   because they're not so energy dense.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.520]   So, and we know that for example,
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.600]   volume is a major signal in the short term
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.640]   for regulating food intake.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:27.040]   So if you just eat more volume, that could be valuable.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.240]   And there's lots of things like that.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.800]   So I think that's another plausible hypothesis,
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.760]   but the truth is we don't really know.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:33.800]   - I have a hypothesis
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.960]   and I don't wanna force you into speculation,
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:39.760]   but given that you've studied and discovered
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.520]   that the neurons and circuits involved in appetitive
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.760]   and consummatory behaviors can learn
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.920]   based on experience and expectation,
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.680]   I think it's fair game to at least ask your thoughts
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.520]   on this.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.240]   So I've been paying a lot of attention to the landscape
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.380]   of what the general public think about,
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.800]   let's call them elimination diets,
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.000]   where people will just eat meat.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:03.840]   - Yes.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.760]   - Or will go into a vegan diet
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.080]   or do some time restricted feeding
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.840]   or do any number of different things
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:14.280]   that have been shown to promote weight loss,
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.920]   provided people obey the laws of thermodynamics
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.440]   and consume fewer calories than they burn.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.280]   - Yeah.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.040]   - Right, I do believe in calories in, calories out.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.880]   And there are a number of different routes to get there
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.820]   and some are more painful, some are less painful,
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.320]   and it depends on the individual lifestyle exercise
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.800]   and on and on.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.400]   But let's just suppose for a moment,
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.720]   based on Kevin's work on highly processed foods
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.360]   versus whole foods,
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.960]   that there's a learning that takes place when we eat.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.800]   - Yes.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.400]   - And that this learning takes place over time
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.520]   such that our brain and appetite
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.720]   start to link the variables of taste,
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:55.880]   macronutrients, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates,
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.600]   sort of knowledge about macronutrients.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.280]   A piece of fish is mostly protein, has some fat.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:04.840]   A bowl of rice is mostly carbohydrate, has some protein.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:05.920]   - Yeah.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.280]   - Put a pat of butter on it, has some fat also, right?
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.000]   It's sort of obvious.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   But taste, macronutrient content,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.280]   calories, which we already know people with anorexia
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:23.960]   are exquisitely good at counting with their eyes.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.840]   So it's possible they represent, again,
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.500]   a pathologic extreme of this.
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:33.380]   And micronutrient content, maybe even amino acid content,
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:35.200]   like how much leucine is there.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.280]   Now, most people aren't thinking about
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.080]   how much leucine is in a meal,
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.720]   but we know that leucine is important
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.840]   for certain aspects of muscle metabolism.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:45.460]   It's present in certain proteins and not others.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.800]   You're going to find less of it in a vegetable,
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:51.500]   typically, than you would in a piece of chicken and so on.
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:55.640]   And that when people eat mostly non-processed
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.760]   or minimally processed foods and not in combination,
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.880]   so we're not talking about stewing all this together
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.260]   or blending all of it together,
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.000]   which sounds disgusting, right?
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.440]   Broccoli rice and a chicken breast
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.800]   blended together just sounds horrible,
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.600]   but eating them separately, if there's some olive oil
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.720]   and a little pat of butter involved,
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.520]   like that sounds pretty good.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.160]   But a highly processed food in some ways
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.760]   is a blending together of macronutrients,
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.700]   micronutrients, if there are any,
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:23.140]   and other features of the food
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.640]   that neurons in the brain seem to pay attention to,
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:29.280]   and then giving it a unified taste, a Dorito, right?
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.120]   - Yes.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:34.240]   - A candy bar that we attach to the product,
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.440]   we attach to the name of the processed food,
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:37.940]   to the packaging.
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:40.360]   But I could imagine, and here's the hypothesis,
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:44.500]   that that is quote unquote confusing to our neural circuits
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.520]   in a way that doesn't match up well
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.740]   with our thermodynamic requirements
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.320]   of how much we're burning versus how much we need to eat.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:57.240]   Whereas when I eat a piece of steak and a vegetable,
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.600]   I actually want less carbohydrate afterwards.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.200]   If I eat the carbohydrate first, for me, it's difficult
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.600]   'cause I love the taste of carbohydrates,
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.120]   especially when they're combined with fat.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:09.260]   But there seems to be an easier time regulating food intake
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:10.840]   when people step back and say,
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:14.480]   "I'm going to consume minimally processed whole foods."
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.400]   And I'm guessing it's not just because
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.440]   they're trying to be healthier,
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.080]   that might be what stimulates the shift,
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.820]   but that the brain starts to learn the relationship
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:27.220]   between food volume, smell, taste,
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:29.600]   what these things look like,
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.340]   and satiation at the level of,
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:33.700]   oh, that's enough amino acids because I had a piece of fish.
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:34.960]   So maybe I don't need to consume
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:35.920]   as much of some other things.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.800]   Or the vegetables provide volume and fiber,
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.400]   and often vegetables can taste really delicious too.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:45.920]   So that there's a linking of nutrients, calories, and taste
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.280]   in a way that's more appropriately matched
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:51.200]   to the energetic demands of the organism,
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.360]   in this case, us humans,
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:56.600]   that highly processed foods bypass.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:00.120]   Okay, now I realize that was long-winded and forgive me,
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.720]   but my audience is used to that.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:04.220]   Whenever I'm trying to table something for,
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:07.500]   no pun intended, for discussion that I would like to think
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.640]   can at least stimulate some additional thinking
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.060]   about a landscape, in this case,
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.020]   nutrition and feeding behavior,
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:16.500]   that for a lot of people is just really confusing.
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:18.300]   And here's why, and this is the last thing I'll say.
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:21.900]   I have several friends who have been very overweight
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.420]   their entire lives,
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.000]   for whom the following diet has worked exceptionally well.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.940]   I'm not a diet coach, I'm not a nutritionist.
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.720]   I don't pretend to be one.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.760]   I say, eat proteins like meat, fish, eggs,
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.020]   vegetables, and fruit,
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:40.040]   and do that for a couple of months,
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:41.520]   and then add back in starches
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:44.840]   as you see fit based on your food intake.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.900]   And without fail, they all lose a ton of weight.
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:49.640]   They're very happy with that.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:52.060]   They add back in a minimum of starches.
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:56.220]   They keep the weight off, and they're also exercising,
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:58.920]   but not more than they were before in most cases.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.180]   And I don't think that it's meat, or fish,
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:02.620]   or vegetables per se.
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:06.060]   I think it's that they finally develop an appreciation
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.640]   for what different foods have
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.900]   in terms of what they actually need.
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.600]   And without fail, they all say,
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.620]   "Oh, you know, I went to this party,
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:14.460]   "and I had a piece of cake,
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:17.060]   "and it didn't taste good to me after three or four bites."
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.400]   So that's interesting too.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.860]   So I just would like your thoughts on this.
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:21.300]   We're not defining any new diets.
[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:22.560]   I don't sell any diets.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:23.680]   I don't do any of that.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.400]   But I find it amazing that when people start eating
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.740]   minimally processed whole foods,
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.360]   I have to assume that their brain changes
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.840]   as it relates to appetite, craving,
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.460]   and just kind of an unconscious understanding
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.540]   about what food is providing them or not.
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:39.580]   And that highly processed foods
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.600]   basically bypass all of this,
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.580]   and just get you to consume more,
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:45.300]   perhaps in hopes of getting something
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.240]   that you probably aren't getting at all,
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.820]   or that you need to consume a lot of this food
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:50.660]   in order to get.
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:53.700]   - There's several interesting ideas there.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.020]   So there's two that come to mind,
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:56.980]   just thinking about what you just said.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.940]   So the one is the idea of what's going on
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:02.460]   when these people consume simpler diets,
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.540]   more of whole foods.
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:08.140]   And one thing I think that's very likely going on
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:10.820]   is this phenomenon of sensory-specific satiety
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:11.900]   as being engaged.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.580]   And so sensory-specific satiety is just the idea
[00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:17.740]   that as you expose yourself repeatedly
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:20.020]   to a certain flavor or taste,
[00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:22.880]   you basically lose appetite for that.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.940]   You get specific loss of appetite for that flavor or taste.
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:27.220]   This is why, as you said,
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:29.100]   basically if you start off eating the protein,
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:30.540]   after a while you're, "I don't want any more salmon,
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:31.980]   "but I would like some carbohydrates now,"
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:34.540]   because you have this sensory-specific satiety.
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:36.940]   And so it's well-known, actually,
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:38.220]   that if you simplify your diet,
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:40.900]   make your diet really simple so there's just a few things,
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:42.500]   then sensory-specific satiety alone
[00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:44.820]   can cause you to eat less,
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:46.640]   basically because there's just less variety in your diet,
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.780]   and you don't wanna eat more of that same thing.
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.500]   And so I think a lot of diets actually,
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.300]   it's not about the specific macronutrient
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:54.440]   or the specific food.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.420]   It's just that they're reducing the variety in the diet.
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:00.480]   Eventually you just get sick of eating the same thing.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.740]   And the thought behind that idea
[00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:04.340]   is that it's important evolutionarily
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:05.660]   so that you eat a diverse diet.
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.300]   It's the reason probably that you want sweets
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:09.820]   after you've eaten a savory meal and so on.
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:11.900]   A second idea, though, that comes to mind
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:14.180]   is just, as you mentioned, this idea of learning.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:18.860]   And so much about our preferences for food are,
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.420]   they're not innate, they're driven by learning, right?
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.180]   And so there are some things that are innate.
[00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:26.340]   So if you put sugar on a baby's tongue, it'll smile,
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:27.380]   indicating that it likes it.
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:29.900]   And if you put something bitter, it'll frown.
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:32.860]   And a rat will do the same thing, a neonate rat.
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:36.660]   But most of flavor and the perception of food
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:38.820]   is not just sweet or bitter.
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:40.600]   It's this much more complex sensation
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.200]   that involves smells, it involves tastes,
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:46.940]   and then it involves how those tastes and smells interact
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:49.300]   with the post-ingestive effects of the nutrients.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.220]   So the sensing of those nutrients in your stomach
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:54.760]   and in your intestine, primarily in your intestine,
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.420]   are thought to then feed back
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:58.220]   and then change your preference for these foods.
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:00.600]   And so there's lots of examples of this
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.020]   that you can just imagine from everyday experience.
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.660]   Most people, the first time they had a beer
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:05.180]   or the first time they had a glass of coffee
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:06.260]   found it repulsive, right?
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.960]   Because it's extremely bitter.
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.420]   But then we come to crave these things
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:10.720]   because we know what they do to our body,
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.080]   we like what they do to our body.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:14.660]   And that doesn't just make us take them like they're medicine
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:16.840]   we actually somehow change our very perception
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:17.740]   of how that flavor is.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.580]   We actually come to savor that flavor
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:20.740]   we previously found disgusting.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:22.660]   And it's because our sensation of
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:25.460]   whether something's good or bad
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:26.900]   depends on our internal state.
[00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:28.980]   And so it's an interesting idea.
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:30.860]   Perhaps if these ultra-processed foods
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:32.220]   that have so many different ingredients
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:34.260]   and such an unnatural combination,
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:37.940]   perhaps this process of learning about the nutrient content
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:41.980]   of different foods and flavors becomes impaired
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:43.380]   because it's just the brain is not used,
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:44.500]   the brain's used to saying, you know,
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.980]   this is a piece of chicken and this is primarily protein
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:49.220]   and so I can gauge, you know, from this flavor,
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:51.300]   I can connect this flavor to an amino acid content
[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:54.920]   but something that's so diverse, it might be harder to do.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:58.500]   - And isn't it the case that the neurons in the gut
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:02.260]   and the hormones that are produced by the gut
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.020]   as we digest food and that the neurons in the brain
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:07.500]   that control appetite and feeding
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:12.000]   have to be tuned to macronutrient content
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.840]   because those are the primary colors of nutrients
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.820]   and nutrients are the way in which we can persist
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:22.460]   on a day-to-day basis, right?
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.380]   I mean, I'm not trying to sound more sophisticated
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:25.860]   where simpler terms would suffice.
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:28.740]   What I'm basically saying is that the neurons in our brains
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.000]   that control these behaviors,
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.080]   both eating and cessation of eating an ingredient
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.740]   or an entire meal,
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:38.740]   can't be tuned to a particular food product
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:43.740]   or to chicken or to an egg or to a steak or to lentils
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:46.940]   but rather to amino acid content,
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:48.640]   essential amino acid content in particular,
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:50.260]   essential fatty acids.
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:51.340]   And in the case of carbohydrate,
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:53.580]   whatever is going to replace whatever glycogen
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:55.020]   we might've depleted, right?
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.820]   I mean, like if we really break it down into biology,
[00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:59.140]   eating is for a purpose.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.240]   And my understanding is that the purpose of eating
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.340]   is to replace those things as needed
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:10.240]   rather than to, you know, taste savory or taste-
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.260]   - Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.820]   Those sensory cues are just markers
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.220]   that tell the brain what might be in that substance.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:21.260]   I think if you look broadly at this difference
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:24.740]   between calories and macronutrients and micronutrients,
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.860]   I would say what you see is that most of the circuits
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:30.100]   that are controlling hunger are primarily calorie specific.
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:33.360]   So they can, like for example, an AGRP neuron,
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:37.900]   I can put sugar, fat or protein into the stomach of a mouse
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.380]   and to an equal extent, inhibit an AGRP neuron
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.780]   as long as they have equal calories.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:42.620]   - Really? - Yeah.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.020]   - So a little drop of olive oil into the belly
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.420]   that has, of an animal that has,
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:50.100]   let's drop, let's say a little bit more.
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:54.100]   Let's say 120 calories of olive oil
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:59.660]   is equal potent to 120 calories of chicken breast?
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.900]   - At the level of these AGRP neurons, it is.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.380]   - So they don't care about the macronutrient?
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.320]   - No, they're really concerned about,
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.220]   they're really concerned about energy.
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:11.620]   There are circuitries that are more concerned
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.180]   with macronutrients individually,
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.740]   although I don't think we know nearly as much
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:15.940]   about how that works.
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:17.180]   And I think the evidence is clear
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.220]   that the strongest defended macronutrient by far is protein.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:25.660]   So protein, I don't think really sugar and fat intake
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:29.200]   are strongly defended in the sense that you're fine
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.700]   if you go without eating sugar, right?
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.340]   Basically you can synthesize sugar from other,
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.220]   from amino acids, for example.
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:38.380]   And you don't develop a specific sugar appetite
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.900]   in the same way you do, for example,
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.060]   if you deprive yourself of hunger
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:43.060]   you develop a protein hunger or essential.
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.700]   I think the difference is that proteins
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.020]   consist of essential amino acids.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:49.220]   There's just this, I forget if it's nine amino acids
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:51.680]   that your body cannot synthesize.
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.720]   You absolutely need them or you will die.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.100]   And so, whereas sugar and fat can be interchanged
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.380]   with other macronutrients.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:01.260]   And there's other things also
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.460]   that you absolutely need to ingest
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:03.740]   like sodium chloride, right?
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:07.060]   So sodium, so there's very few,
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.840]   deprive an animal of sodium,
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.180]   they will develop this salt appetite
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.260]   that's incredible basically,
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.700]   and that's completely innate.
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:16.540]   But that's, I think salt appetite
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.820]   and protein appetite are the things
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.340]   that are probably the most strongly regulated
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:23.300]   at the level of the macro and micronutrients.
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:24.420]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.940]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Element.
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.220]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.620]   that has everything you need.
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:31.820]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:34.580]   and potassium in the correct amounts and ratios
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.880]   and nothing you don't, which means no sugar.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.620]   Now, I and others on this podcast
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:40.040]   have talked about the critical importance
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.500]   of hydration for proper brain and body functioning.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.420]   Even a slight degree of dehydration
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.940]   can diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:49.240]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:52.220]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:53.420]   are critical for the functioning
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:54.920]   of all the cells in your body,
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.000]   especially your neurons, your nerve cells.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.460]   Drinking Element dissolved in water
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.820]   makes it very easy to ensure
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.580]   that you're getting adequate hydration
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.180]   and adequate electrolytes.
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.660]   To make sure I'm getting proper amounts
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.380]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.220]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.200]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.440]   when I wake up in the morning
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.920]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.040]   I'll also drink Element dissolved in water
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.960]   during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.320]   especially in hot days when I'm sweating a lot,
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.360]   losing water and electrolytes.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.280]   They have a bunch of different
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.960]   great tasting flavors of Element.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.520]   My favorite is the watermelon,
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.080]   although I confess I also like the raspberry and the citrus.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.120]   Basically, I like all the flavors.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.580]   And Element has also just released
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:34.640]   a new line of canned sparkling Element.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.400]   So these aren't the packets you dissolve in water,
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.760]   these are cans of Element that you crack open
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.100]   like any other canned drink, like a soda,
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.400]   but you're getting your hydration
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.300]   and your electrolytes with no sugar.
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.440]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:48.320]   you can go to drinkelement, spelled L-M-N-T,
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.960]   .com/huberman to claim a free Element sample pack
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.800]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.840]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.080]   to claim a free sample pack.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.840]   If we could talk about body weight homeostasis
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.600]   for a moment, I think that would be useful.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.000]   So let's say somebody decides they want to lose some weight.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.600]   They caloric restrict slightly,
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.440]   either by exercising more or eating less or both.
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.760]   Their body weight drops by a bit.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.240]   Let's say they lose 10 pounds,
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.660]   eight of which are body fat.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:23.160]   They lose a little bit of lean mass also.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.760]   They're now at a new lower body weight.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.940]   Are the AGRP neurons motivated
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:29.340]   to have them seek out more food?
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:30.640]   In other words, are they hungrier
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.160]   and more motivated to find and eat food?
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.520]   Or do these AGRP neurons learn,
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.840]   "Hey, body weight is lower
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:42.640]   and I don't need to push to find so much food so often."
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.400]   - No, I mean, the idea is that the AGRP neurons
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.120]   are more active when you lose weight
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.800]   and that chronic activation of those neurons,
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.120]   in part because leptin levels are lower in the blood
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.520]   because you've lost weight,
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.240]   is that drive, that counter-regulatory drive
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.200]   that drives you to then consume more food.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.600]   - But then how do people ever keep weight off?
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.140]   - Well, so part of the answer is they don't.
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.800]   I mean, so there's so-
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.640]   - Really?
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.520]   'Cause I would argue like I have these friends
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.520]   who were very heavy.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:12.680]   Most of the excess weight was body fat for a long time.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.520]   They seem to be doing great
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.840]   eating the way that I described before.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.040]   And by the way, I'm not a proponent
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.960]   of any one particular diet.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.520]   I have vegan friends, carnivore friends, et cetera,
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.420]   but that pattern of eating I described before
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:24.800]   has been enormously successful for them.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.400]   I haven't run a randomized controlled trial.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.920]   It's not my job to do that in the realm of nutrition,
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.480]   but they're doing great.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.760]   They claim to be sated.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:36.160]   They are so happy with the way things are going.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.980]   And I don't hear that they're constantly hungry.
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.440]   I hear that they're constantly sated.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:46.440]   - Well, so I would say that there have been efforts
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.560]   for a long time to develop diets
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.800]   that would help people consistently lose weight.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.300]   And it has been very unsuccessful.
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.480]   There are some people who, for various reasons,
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.280]   can successfully lose weight and keep it off.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.360]   And I don't know that I have a good answer
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.520]   for what's going on in those individual cases,
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.920]   how they are the exceptions to the rule.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.200]   What about them is different that makes sense.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.040]   - Some also quit drinking alcohol.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.080]   - Yeah, so there's other things.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:07.920]   So, you know, I think-
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.400]   - So behavioral regulation is better
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.040]   when you're sober as opposed to-
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.380]   - You can change your environment.
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:15.120]   But, you know, so what this is sort of getting at
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.320]   is what is the counter-regulatory response to weight loss?
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.560]   And so this has been studied.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.760]   It was first studied in the context of energy expenditure.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.780]   And because energy expenditure
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.880]   is actually surprisingly easier to measure in humans
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.980]   than food intake, because people don't tell you accurately
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:31.820]   what food they eat.
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:32.880]   If they're free living humans,
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.540]   they have to fill out a questionnaire.
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:37.480]   But, and the idea is that
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.760]   for every kilogram of weight you lose,
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.580]   so it's about 2.2 pounds, I think,
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:45.120]   your energy expenditure decreases
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.720]   by about 30 kilocalories a day.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.460]   Now, so not a ton, but that is significant, right?
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:52.300]   30 calories.
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.580]   And then if you lose, as you said, 10 pounds,
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:57.580]   then that's 150 calories, and that adds up over time.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:00.420]   One interesting thing about that
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:03.380]   is that if you take people who were obese
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:04.700]   and then they've lost a ton of weight.
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.180]   So there's a study by Rudy Liebel
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:07.820]   about 25 years ago that did this.
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:11.340]   Take people who lost like 100 pounds
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.660]   and then take a control group
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:15.220]   that has the same height, weight,
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:16.580]   basically the same body composition
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:19.140]   as those people who've now lost 100 pounds.
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.300]   Compare their energy expenditure.
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:22.900]   The energy expenditure in the people
[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:25.220]   that lost all the weight is about 25% lower
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.900]   than the people who never were obese.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:30.060]   And so those people who lost the weight,
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.180]   we call them the reduced obese,
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:33.020]   or that's what they were called in those studies.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.460]   And the idea is that there's now this chronic deficit.
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.300]   They have to eat 25% less than someone
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.460]   who looks the same as them, is the same height as them,
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:41.420]   the same weight as them,
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:43.340]   in order to maintain that body weight.
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:45.880]   What's unclear is whether that's because those people
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.500]   simply always had a slower metabolism,
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.720]   they were always destined to be obese,
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.560]   and then you're just basically,
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:50.580]   you're comparing two different groups,
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:52.740]   or whether something about the process
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.100]   of gaining weight and being at a higher weight
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:55.940]   for a longer period of time changes the brain
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:58.780]   so that then once you lose the weight, it's irreversible.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:01.680]   But there have been studies looking at at least a year,
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.220]   and it doesn't seem to come back within a year,
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.500]   that difference in energy expenditure.
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.020]   Now, the question is, is that really the big effect?
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:09.700]   Is that why it's so hard to lose weight, energy expenditure,
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:11.860]   or is it because you're hungrier?
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.300]   And that's actually much harder to measure.
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.980]   But there was another really nice study,
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.500]   again, by Kevin Hall, investigating this.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:21.540]   He used a really clever approach, this drug.
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:23.260]   So basically what he wanted to do was,
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:26.580]   is he reasoned that you can measure people's body weight,
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:30.220]   and you can measure people's energy expenditure.
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.480]   And because calories in, calories out,
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.460]   if we can measure body weight
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.260]   and energy expenditure accurately,
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.860]   we can then back-calculate
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:38.900]   how much that person was actually eating.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:43.600]   So let's see what happens when you have people lose weight.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.340]   How does their food intake change?
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.460]   But the trick to this is, you need to do it in such a way
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:49.940]   that you don't just tell them to go run on a treadmill,
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:51.140]   because if you tell someone to go run on a treadmill
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:52.220]   and lose weight, then basically,
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.460]   they're thinking about the fact that they're doing this.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.980]   So you need to do it in some way covertly,
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:57.460]   so that you increase their energy expenditure,
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:58.660]   cause them to lose weight,
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.740]   but without them realizing that's what's happening.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:05.220]   So they gave them these drugs, these SGLT2 inhibitors.
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:06.780]   And it's a pill you can take.
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:08.300]   They're used for diabetes.
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:11.940]   They block this protein, SGLT2, in the kidney
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:13.380]   that is necessary for glucose
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:14.860]   to be reabsorbed into the blood.
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:16.340]   And so basically what happens is you pee out
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.780]   about like 90 grams of glucose a day.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.140]   But you don't know that you're doing that.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.540]   And that causes you to lose energy.
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.620]   So these people would lose some weight.
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:25.940]   And then measure how their food intake changes.
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:29.260]   And what that showed is that for every two pounds or so
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:31.140]   of weight you lose, your hunger goes up
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:33.440]   by a hundred calories per day.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:35.900]   So basically you've got a 30 kilocalorie decrease
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:36.980]   in energy expenditure,
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:38.880]   a hundred kilocalorie decrease in appetite
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.620]   for every two pounds you lose, on average.
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:41.620]   Some people will be exceptions, right?
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:42.500]   And they won't experience that at all
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.060]   for aspects of their physiology we don't understand.
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:48.060]   And so the increased hunger seems to be the main reason
[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.620]   people find it so difficult to keep weight off.
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.420]   - That seems the perfect segue to talk about GLP-1,
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.540]   glucagon-like peptide one,
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.080]   ozempic, monjaro, and similar drugs.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:02.940]   My understanding of the back history on these
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:06.440]   is that a biologist obsessed with Gila monsters,
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:11.700]   a reptile that doesn't need to eat very often
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:14.140]   discovered a peptide within their bloodstream
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:19.140]   called Xtendin that allowed them to eat very seldom.
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:24.300]   It curbed appetite in the Gila monster of all things.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:30.100]   And it has a analog homologue, you know, we don't know.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:31.980]   I don't know the sequence homology exactly,
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:36.620]   but there's a similar peptide made in mice and in humans
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.940]   that suppresses appetite.
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:41.020]   If you would, could you tell us what is known
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:44.060]   about how GLP-1 works to suppress appetite,
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:45.980]   where in the body and/or brain?
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:50.180]   And your sort of read of these drugs
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:55.180]   and what's happening there, good, bad, exciting, ugly.
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:57.420]   - Sure, I'd be happy to.
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.240]   - Anything else?
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.740]   - So the story of GLP-1,
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:02.240]   so the Gila monster is an important turn,
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.080]   and I'll talk about that.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.120]   It actually goes back before that quite a ways.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.080]   So I should take a step back and say, you know,
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.900]   these were developed as drugs for diabetes, right?
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.780]   And so, and diabetes is a condition
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:13.700]   where basically you have elevated blood glucose,
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:15.700]   either because you don't produce enough insulin
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:18.280]   or because your insulin is not effective.
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.580]   And so back in sort of the 1920s,
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:24.300]   right around the time insulin was discovered,
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.620]   there was this phenomenon discovered
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:27.120]   known as the incretin effect.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.980]   And what it was- - Incretin?
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:31.820]   - Incretin, yeah. - Not the cretin effect.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:32.660]   - Not the cretin effect.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.020]   - You can observe the cretin effect
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.980]   in numerous places in daily life and online, just kidding.
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:39.260]   - So it's called the incretin effect.
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:41.220]   You can think of it as increase insulin
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:43.140]   'cause that's what the effect is.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:45.860]   And the idea was that if you take glucose by mouth,
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.380]   if you consume glucose orally,
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:50.180]   versus if you have the same amount of glucose
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:54.420]   injected intravenously, more insulin is produced
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.620]   when you take the glucose orally
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:58.460]   versus if it's delivered intravenously.
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:59.660]   Suggesting something about the process
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:03.780]   of ingesting the glucose causes more insulin to be released
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:06.980]   and causes you to lower your body sugar more accurately
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:09.720]   and more strongly. - Interesting.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.000]   - Which is a little bit counterintuitive
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.460]   because in the pancreas, right?
[01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:13.700]   So insulin is released from the pancreas,
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.020]   from the beta cell.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.180]   The pancreas senses the glucose concentration
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:18.020]   in the blood directly.
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:20.140]   And so it suggests that insulin is being released
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:21.820]   not just in response to changes in blood glucose,
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.380]   but in response to a second factor.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.820]   And so they call that an incretin.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:29.420]   And through various experiments it was shown
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:31.780]   that this incretin effect comes from the intestine,
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:34.820]   that there's some substance being produced by the intestine
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:36.980]   that when you eat a meal,
[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:38.620]   sugar goes through your intestine
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:42.340]   that boosts this insulin response to glucose in the blood.
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:43.740]   And people immediately realized
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:45.180]   this could potentially be very valuable.
[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:47.300]   And the reason is that you can treat diabetes
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.420]   with insulin injections, but insulin is dangerous, right?
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:50.540]   'Cause if you inject too much insulin,
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.660]   you can kill yourself by making yourself hypoglycemic, right?
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.700]   So you have to be very careful.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.500]   But the thing about the incretin effect
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:59.020]   is it's not causing insulin release directly,
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.740]   but it's rather boosting the natural insulin release
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:03.700]   that comes when your glucose is higher in your blood.
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:04.820]   So it's sort of an amplifier
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:06.980]   on the natural insulin release.
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:08.180]   So basically in the years that followed,
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:10.060]   whenever someone would find a new hormone,
[01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:11.620]   they would test it, is it this incretin?
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.940]   And there's lots of failures, they weren't the incretin.
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:16.700]   But then, so there's this other hormone
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:20.580]   that comes from the pancreas called glucagon, right?
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.340]   And so glucagon, it was also discovered in the 1920s,
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:25.500]   glucagon is kind of the anti-insulin.
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.140]   So when blood sugar goes low,
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:30.140]   glucagon is released in order to cause your liver
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.180]   to release glucose into the blood.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:35.820]   So glucagon and insulin are these two opposing hormones.
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:36.980]   Glucagon was known for a long time,
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:39.820]   but people discovered in sort of the 1980s
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:42.980]   that the glucagon gene is expressed in other tissues
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:44.620]   other than the pancreas.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.380]   And it's differentially processed,
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:47.940]   the protein is differentially processed
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.060]   to produce different hormones,
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:51.060]   hormones other than glucagon.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.740]   And they discovered there was one in the intestine,
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:54.660]   and so they called it glucagon-like peptide
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:56.420]   because it comes from the same gene,
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.620]   but it's just slightly different,
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:00.060]   it's cut up slightly differently.
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.500]   And this hormone wasn't incretin.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.100]   So basically if you put it on beta cells,
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.900]   you get this increased response of insulin
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:08.100]   in response to glucose.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:10.860]   And so there was the idea,
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.540]   okay, this could be a great diabetes drug, right?
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:14.660]   And I should say there was one other incretin
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:17.460]   that's been found, it's called GIP, G-I-P,
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:18.780]   and that will be important
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.900]   in talking about some of these other drugs,
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:23.660]   also a hormone that comes from the intestine.
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:28.420]   And so the challenge with making GLP-1 into a drug
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.740]   is that it has an extremely short half-life.
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:33.760]   So it has a half-life of about two minutes in the blood.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:36.740]   And so even if you inject people with GLP-1,
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.140]   it won't really be useful for anything.
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.060]   You don't decrease appetite,
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:41.140]   you don't affect blood sugar 'cause it's just degraded
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:42.660]   too fast.
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.540]   And the reason it's degraded is because there's an enzyme,
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:49.540]   DPP-4 is what it's called, that degrades GLP-1.
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:50.620]   So the first thing people tried was,
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.940]   let's make inhibitors of that enzyme
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.780]   so we can boost this natural GLP-1 signal.
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:57.500]   And those are approved diabetes drugs,
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:58.340]   they're called gliptins.
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:14:59.160]   You've probably heard about them.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.100]   Genuvia is the most common one.
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:02.780]   And those boost the level of GLP-1,
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:06.060]   the natural GLP-1 produced from the intestine
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:07.380]   by about three-fold.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:09.180]   And they're effective in treating diabetes.
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.420]   - Do people lose weight?
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:12.500]   - People do not lose weight.
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.900]   And that's one of the key reasons that we know
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.620]   that the natural function of GLP-1
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:18.140]   is not really to control body weight
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:19.940]   because you can boost the level three-fold
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.940]   with these DPP-4 drugs.
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:22.980]   Millions of people have taken them,
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:24.260]   they do not lose weight.
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.800]   That's a great question.
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.080]   So, but a three-fold is great,
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.740]   but you'd like to increase it even more, right?
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.780]   And to do that, you can't block this enzyme.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:34.340]   You have to actually produce a GLP-1
[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.580]   that is more stable in the blood.
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:39.140]   And that's where this lizard that you mentioned
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:40.580]   comes into play.
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:44.440]   It produces a stabilized form of GLP-1 and it's a venom.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.340]   No one knows why.
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:48.860]   One hypothesis is that it's something to do with the lizard,
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:51.240]   as you said, basically having this long time period
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.560]   between meals and it needs to regulate its blood glucose.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.940]   Who knows if that is true,
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.360]   but it turned out to be fortuitous
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.220]   because then this GLP-1 from this lizard,
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.500]   it has a half-life of like two hours.
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.740]   And so the first GLP-1 drug that was approved
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:06.220]   was just this molecule from this lizard, basically.
[01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:11.220]   And it's called Xenotide and it was approved in 2005.
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:15.700]   Works well for diabetes, has a half-life of two hours.
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:19.940]   You inject it and it doesn't cause a ton of weight loss.
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:22.660]   But two hours is good, but it's not so great.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:24.860]   So then the pharmaceutical industry said,
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.820]   "Can we basically improve this even further?"
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.620]   And so they start engineering this hormone,
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:30.900]   making mutations, attaching lipid tails
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:33.080]   to make it bind to proteins in the blood
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.740]   that would stabilize it.
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:36.060]   - Chemistry jockey stuff.
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.060]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.100]   And I think the next big advance
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:40.660]   was this compound liraglutide.
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:45.300]   And liraglutide was approved for diabetes in 2010
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.740]   and then for weight loss in 2014.
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:49.860]   And so liraglutide has a half-life
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.700]   of about 13 hours in the blood.
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:52.700]   Now you're getting up to something serious.
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:56.260]   We've gone from two minutes, two hours, 13 hours.
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:59.980]   And you get better effects on aspects of blood glucose
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:00.900]   and diabetes control.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:04.360]   And they started to see that some people were losing weight.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.400]   Very variable responses.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.000]   Not everyone loses weight on liraglutide.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.280]   And one of the things they noticed
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.520]   that I think is just as fascinating
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.160]   just sort of example of how drug discovery works
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.060]   in the real world.
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:15.640]   You know, a lot of these people would take liraglutide.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.280]   Now it has this longer half-life.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.660]   They'll start to get nauseous.
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:19.500]   And that would limit
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.800]   how much of the liraglutide they could take.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.680]   And it's a known side effect of these GLP-1 drugs.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:26.280]   It causes nausea and sort of this gastrointestinal distress.
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.120]   But they noticed that over time,
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.760]   the nausea would just sort of go away.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.540]   And so they would start dose escalating,
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:33.620]   sort of raising the dose that the person would take.
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:36.820]   So you would go, you know, a month at this dose,
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:38.540]   and then a month at a slightly higher dose,
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.820]   and then a month at a slightly higher dose.
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:41.220]   And you could work your way up.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.820]   And these side effects would reappear,
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:44.280]   but then they'd go away.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.660]   And then once you got up to the highest doses,
[01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:47.020]   then people really started losing weight.
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:48.660]   And so there's a couple of things
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:49.820]   that our pharmaceutical industry realized,
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:50.660]   wow, these are potentially
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:52.540]   really effective weight loss drugs.
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:55.580]   And also this nausea, which we thought was, you know,
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:58.500]   a killer, people are able to just get used to it.
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:59.420]   And then it just goes away.
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:01.800]   It undergoes, the word is tachyphylaxis.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.460]   So the idea is that the receptor that's affecting,
[01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:08.020]   in the gut that's causing these effects,
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:09.940]   it undergoes some sort of downregulation
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.380]   with chronic exposure.
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:14.580]   So liraglutide, you know, it's been around,
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:17.060]   you know, it's been on the market for 14 years now,
[01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:18.460]   was used, but still you're only getting
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:21.620]   sort of like seven to 10% weight loss,
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:25.300]   which is good, but not like, you know, amazing, impressive.
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:28.180]   But then semaglutide came along.
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:31.220]   And that was approved for diabetes in 2017.
[01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:32.900]   And semaglutide is Ozempic,
[01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:37.900]   or also marketed as Wigovi for weight loss.
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:41.020]   And semaglutide now has a half-life of seven days.
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:42.980]   So now we've gone from two minutes,
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:46.200]   two hours, 13 hours, seven days.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.940]   And you can really jack up the concentration
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:50.880]   with a seven-day half-life.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.140]   And then they saw people started really losing weight.
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:54.860]   And so in some of those trials,
[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:56.980]   people lost, you know, 16% of their body weight,
[01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:59.700]   which previously had been unattainable.
[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.260]   - In what timeframe?
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:02.980]   - Typically takes about a year.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:05.980]   - Okay, and most of the loss in body weight
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:09.100]   is from body fat or from other compartments?
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:12.260]   - The typical number is that if you lose weight,
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:14.220]   either through dieting or through taking one of these drugs,
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.140]   and you don't do anything like eat a high-protein diet
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.860]   or do resistance training,
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:21.020]   somewhere between 25 and 33% of what you lose
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.140]   is gonna be muscle.
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:23.300]   The rest is gonna be fat.
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.300]   - But as you said, some of that could be offset
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:27.860]   by resistance training and/or consuming
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:30.180]   a higher-protein diet.
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:32.060]   - Yeah, you can almost completely eliminate that
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:35.140]   if you eat enough protein and do serious weightlifting.
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:37.700]   Obviously not the whole population
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:38.660]   is interested in doing that.
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.420]   And there's been a lot of discussion
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:42.420]   of how serious a side effect this is.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:44.700]   You know, among elderly people,
[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:46.220]   you don't wanna be losing muscle mass
[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:48.380]   because you're already losing so much muscle mass.
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.900]   On the other hand, the counterargument that has been made,
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:52.340]   which I think is also kind of convincing,
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:55.260]   is that, true, you're losing some muscle,
[01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:56.940]   but you're also losing all this fat,
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:59.140]   and you no longer need as much muscle
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:01.060]   when you're not carrying around as much body fat.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:03.100]   So people who are heavier naturally have more muscle
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:04.660]   because they need to to move their body, right?
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:05.500]   And so--
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:10.460]   - Yeah, the calves on very obese people are often enormous.
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:11.300]   - Exactly.
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:12.300]   - And then they lose weight and--
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:13.460]   - Exactly.
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.140]   - And I mentioned the calves in particular
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:18.620]   because they're carrying a lot of the body load.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:19.500]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.420]   So it's still an open question as to whether,
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:24.780]   as to how serious a problem this lean muscle mass loss is,
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.660]   although the pharmaceutical industry
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:28.100]   is all in now on making drugs
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:29.220]   that basically are gonna prevent that.
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.100]   So that's something that will be happening
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:32.180]   probably in the future.
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:33.500]   - Is it a, sorry to interrupt,
[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:37.140]   but is the weight loss on these drugs
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.700]   the consequence of reduced appetite
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:41.700]   or some other aspect of metabolism?
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:44.740]   And if it's the consequence of reduced appetite,
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:47.300]   is that occurring at the level of the brain and gut
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:50.220]   or a combination?
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.660]   - So it's almost entirely reduced appetite,
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:54.220]   and it's almost entirely occurring
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:55.380]   at the level of the brain.
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:56.260]   - Which neurons?
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:59.860]   - It's thought that the key targets of these drugs
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:01.100]   are neurons in these two regions.
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:03.740]   One's called the nucleus of the solitary tract,
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.500]   and the other one's called the area posteroma.
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:06.780]   - So we're back in the brainstem.
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:07.900]   - Back in the brainstem.
[01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:09.420]   So these are actually the neurons
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:12.220]   in that decerebrate rat story I was telling earlier.
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:13.940]   These are the brain regions that are preserved
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:14.820]   in the decerebrate rat.
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:16.300]   The decerebrate rat still has these
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:19.100]   very caudal brainstem structures.
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:20.580]   They're two very special brain regions
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:23.700]   because they get direct input from the vagus nerve.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:26.020]   So the vagus nerve is the nerve that innervates your stomach
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:28.060]   and intestines and heart and lungs,
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:30.300]   and is sort of the major pathway from gut to brain.
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:33.940]   It provides most of the neural input from gut to brain,
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:36.820]   telling you about things like your stomach distention,
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:38.780]   how many nutrients are in your intestine,
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:40.580]   breathing, all that stuff.
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:42.460]   And almost all of those vagal nerves
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:45.620]   terminate on these two structures in the brainstem.
[01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:48.060]   - When I hear posteroma, I think about nausea
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:51.180]   because I was taught that posteroma contains neurons
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.900]   that can stimulate vomiting.
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:55.220]   And this seems to link up well,
[01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:56.420]   at least in the logical sense,
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:22:00.000]   with the idea that stimulating, activating receptors
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.940]   in these neurons within posteroma
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:05.300]   might explain part of the transient nausea side effect
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:07.660]   of ozempic and related drugs.
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:09.220]   - Yeah, so the current thought is that
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:11.620]   a lot of the nausea is coming from activating the neurons
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:12.700]   in the area of posteroma,
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:15.340]   and that a lot of the sort of physiologic satiety
[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:16.940]   is coming from activating the neurons
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:18.680]   in the nucleus of the solitary tract.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:20.060]   Now, the whole brain is connected to each other,
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:21.660]   and so if you really turn on these neurons
[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:22.700]   in the NTS and the AP,
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:24.060]   they're gonna talk to the hypothalamus
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:24.900]   and all these other brain regions,
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:26.380]   it's gonna change the whole brain.
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:27.640]   So it's not just those regions,
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:31.100]   but these drugs don't have great access to the brain.
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:32.480]   They can penetrate a little bit into the brain,
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.380]   but they don't penetrate into the whole brain.
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.380]   And it's thought that if you take
[01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:38.740]   fluorescently labeled versions of these drugs
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:40.380]   and see where they, so you can visualize
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:41.620]   where do they actually go,
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:43.540]   they're enriched in these structures in the brainstem.
[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:44.500]   So that's why people think
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.300]   that this is probably where they're acting.
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:50.300]   - Is that because there's an abundance of the receptors
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:55.300]   for these compounds in post-trauma and NTS,
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:57.180]   or is it because the blood-brain barrier
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:59.620]   is somehow weaker at that location?
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:01.140]   - It's because the blood-brain barrier is weaker.
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:02.720]   So basically it's a region,
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:06.140]   what's known as a circumventricular organ,
[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:08.420]   meaning it's one of these rare places in the brain
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:09.940]   where the blood-brain barrier is weakened,
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:13.180]   and so substances can come from the outside into the brain.
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:16.060]   And that's important for these big peptides,
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.180]   'cause these are not small molecules,
[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:19.020]   these are big peptides with lipid chains on them
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:19.860]   and other things.
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.340]   So they can really only get into areas of the brain
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:24.780]   where the blood-brain barrier is weakened.
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:26.340]   - I really appreciate that you mentioned
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:29.380]   the half-life issue with GLP-1
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:33.340]   and the fact that these DPP-4 antagonists
[01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:36.260]   did not lead to weight loss despite increasing,
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:40.260]   circulating GLP by threefold.
[01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:43.820]   This is relevant to a number of different claims
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:47.260]   that people make that a given food or a given drink
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.540]   increases GLP-1.
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.140]   I've actually said before,
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:52.580]   I'm a big consumer of Yerba Mate,
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:54.940]   my father's side is Argentine
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.820]   and it's a known appetite suppressant,
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:58.700]   but it contains caffeine and other stimulants
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.100]   that might explain some of that.
[01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:02.260]   And it's not a robust appetite suppressant
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:05.340]   to the point where most people would rely on it
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:07.060]   as a weight loss compound.
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:09.220]   But anyway, it's my preferred source of caffeine,
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:11.020]   but I've said before,
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:13.940]   there's some evidence that it can increase GLP-1,
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:15.400]   but based on what you've said,
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.240]   the increases in GLP-1 that it creates
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:18.920]   are very unlikely to produce
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:21.080]   the kind of appetite suppressive effect
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.640]   that would lead to any significant weight loss
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.880]   in somebody that's obese,
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.740]   presumably that are separate
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:29.000]   from any caffeine stimulatory effects.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.520]   So you can't separate 'cause it's a complex compound,
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.880]   this Yerba Mate thing, it's got lots of things in it.
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:38.880]   But also, I've observed you being vocal on social media
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:44.120]   when people have said, "Hey, this thing increases GLP-1."
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:49.120]   You, quite appropriately, I think, said, "Wait."
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:55.060]   Ozempic and drugs like that increase GLP-1 thousandfold.
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:57.440]   When you talk about a food or drink
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.360]   or maybe a supplement increasing GLP-1,
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.980]   it's very unlikely to increase its GLP-1 to that level.
[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.520]   Meaning, unless you're getting into the hundredfold
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.100]   or thousandfold increases,
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:12.440]   probably not right to talk about GLP-1
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.680]   being the source of any appetite suppressive effect.
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:16.240]   - Yeah, that's all correct.
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:18.240]   So, I mean, I think it's important sometimes
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.520]   to distinguish between pharmacologic and physiologic effects.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.180]   So physiologic is what the hormone naturally does
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:27.080]   in your body and what can be modulated by natural things
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.800]   like eating a different food.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:31.200]   And you might get a twofold change in your GLP-1
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.240]   by eating a different food, one food versus the other.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.680]   But as we know from those DPP-4 inhibitors,
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:37.240]   it's not gonna really change your appetite
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.240]   because the drugs increase it threefold.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:43.880]   These GLP-1 agonists are really a pharmacologic effect,
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.000]   effect that only happens with drugs.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.080]   So you get a thousand to 10,000 fold higher concentrations
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:51.800]   of these drugs in your blood than the natural hormone.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.560]   And so it's just,
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.520]   there's no diet that's ever gonna give you that.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.320]   - And there's no precedent for it either.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:00.000]   So should we be at all concerned about that?
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.680]   I mean, they run clinical trials and address safety,
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:05.240]   but when you're talking about a thousandfold increase
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.720]   in essentially a peptide hormone,
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:11.880]   if we were talking about a different peptide hormone,
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:14.000]   not, you know, pick one, you know,
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.800]   oxytocin or estrogen, testosterone,
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.040]   they're not really, you know, broadly speaking,
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:23.460]   most people would be concerned about thousandfold dosing
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:24.560]   of something like that.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.240]   And obviously there are clinical indications
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.600]   where that's important.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:31.480]   However, my observation of the ever-expanding literature
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:36.480]   on GLP-1 agonists is that there seems to be improvements
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.460]   in like reduction in alcohol consumption.
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:46.120]   And by the way, why would increasing GLP-1
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:49.080]   reduce craving for alcohol?
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.500]   It seems like there's an ever-expanding list of things
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:54.360]   that GLP-1 agonism is good for.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.680]   But we are talking about,
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:59.320]   I would say supra-physiological levels when one takes it.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.160]   And again, I'm not against it, nor for it,
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:04.280]   I'm just paying attention to the literature.
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.440]   - So I would say that that's absolutely right.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.800]   When you're increasing the level of hormone a thousandfold,
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.680]   you need to be careful, see what's happening.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.120]   But at the end, it's an empirical question.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.920]   What does it actually do to a person?
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.540]   And it can only be answered through experiments.
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:18.940]   And I think the nice thing about these GLP-1 drugs
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:20.640]   that a lot of people don't realize is
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.840]   they've been around and approved since 2005,
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:23.920]   the earliest ones.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.480]   And even something like Ozempic,
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:27.360]   which maybe only entered the public consciousness
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:28.500]   in the last year or two, right?
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.920]   It's been around for seven-ish years, I think.
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:34.260]   And so, and big clinical trials with these drugs.
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:36.920]   And so, and the evidence so far
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.680]   is that they seem to be incredibly safe.
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.440]   And as you said, not just incredibly safe,
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:44.280]   but they seem to have all these unexpected health benefits
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.720]   that seem to be, in some cases,
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.120]   even unrelated to weight loss.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.320]   And so, because of the reasons you mentioned,
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.600]   one of the things the FDA requires
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.960]   from these pharmaceutical companies for diabetes drugs
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.160]   is these large cardiac outcome trials.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.800]   So basically where you measure stroke
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:01.960]   and where you measure heart attacks
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:04.180]   and death from any cardiac cause,
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:07.460]   big trials, like 20,000 people, four years,
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.500]   cost like a billion dollars to run.
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:12.620]   And the data from the semaglutide, the Ozempic trial,
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:16.420]   came out last year and, as expected,
[01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:18.900]   reduced the rate of heart attacks, strokes,
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:20.940]   all-cause mortality according to cardiac,
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:23.260]   for cardiac reasons.
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:25.060]   But what's really surprising was
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:26.100]   a lot of that seemed to happen
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:27.780]   before the people even lost weight.
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:28.860]   So there was already a difference
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:31.180]   between the placebo group and the semaglutide group
[01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:32.240]   before the people on the drug
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.160]   had lost a significant amount of weight.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.440]   And there was no correlation
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.520]   between the amount of weight they lost
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:40.320]   and how well they were protected from heart disease.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.440]   And that's led many people to think
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.460]   that some of these effects actually could be due
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:46.200]   to other things the GLP-1s are doing that we didn't expect.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:49.040]   And so one thing is there's an idea emerging
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.760]   that they are anti-inflammatory.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:55.640]   So these brain regions, the areoposteum and the NTS,
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.200]   are also really important for this reflex
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.200]   known as the inflammatory reflex
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:02.920]   that basically acts, starts with the vagus nerve,
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.540]   goes to these brain regions of the brainstem,
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.920]   and then goes back down to the body
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:08.240]   to basically suppress,
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.520]   to prevent out-of-control inflammation.
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.080]   And so it's thought that these drugs
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.880]   perhaps have an anti-inflammatory effect
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:15.240]   that explains some of that.
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:18.000]   - Sounds like the patent on these drugs
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.480]   just got extended by another 100 years.
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.200]   That's a biopharma joke.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.760]   I mean, just to put context on it,
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:30.520]   drugs can be patented and sold as a commercial version
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.980]   and not as generic versions until the patent runs out,
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:34.300]   unless companies are able to find
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.680]   another approved clinical use,
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:38.720]   in which case it can be remarketed
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:42.720]   only as a brand name, not generic version.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.920]   So a lot of companies, once they do the safety testing
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:49.120]   and given everything they put into the R&D,
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.280]   into the research and development,
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:52.240]   there's a very big incentive
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.880]   to not necessarily finding new drugs,
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.560]   but finding new uses for the same drugs
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:01.080]   and not allowing generic versions into the picture.
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:03.160]   And that's why it's likely to be,
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:07.680]   based on these what sounds like additional uses
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:10.640]   of ozempic-related compounds,
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.120]   a long time before there's generic ozempic available.
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.240]   - I think it will be a while.
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.160]   I don't know the exact status of the patents,
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.640]   but I'm guessing it's gonna be a while
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:19.840]   before there are generic versions,
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.960]   but there's a lot of competition coming.
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:24.000]   So every major pharmaceutical company
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.680]   or almost every major pharmaceutical company
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.280]   now has a GLP-1 program.
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:28.120]   - Really?
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:31.920]   - And some of them are really exciting, actually.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.360]   So, I mean, the general trend in this area
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:36.640]   is what people call GLP-1+,
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:39.120]   which means you take the GLP-1 agonist,
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:42.200]   which is already giving you 15% weight loss or so,
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.640]   and then you add additional things to that
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:46.000]   to give it additional properties.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.720]   So one compound is from Eli Lilly,
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:48.820]   which makes this other,
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:50.200]   so there's this other drug on the market
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:51.180]   that we haven't talked about,
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:53.120]   but terzepatide, which is known as Moonjaro,
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:56.040]   for diabetes and Zep-Bound for obesity,
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.840]   which is even better, really, in almost every respect,
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:00.120]   a better drug than ozempic.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.480]   So people lose more weight,
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:04.460]   so it's about 21% weight loss at a year.
[01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:10.060]   Fewer side effects, at least at comparable doses.
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:14.440]   That seems to be because this other drug, terzepatide,
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:15.680]   it has two targets, not one.
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:20.680]   So whereas ozempic is just a GLP-1 receptor agonist,
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.280]   terzepatide is a dual agonist of GLP-1
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:27.240]   and this other incretin that we talked about, GIP, G-I-P.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.760]   And it seems like having that GIP agonism
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:32.840]   actually acts as an anti-nausea effect,
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:34.600]   that sort of counteracts some of the nausea
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.440]   caused by the GLP-1 in the area post-treatment.
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.240]   There are GIP receptor neurons in the area post-treatment,
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.440]   this nausea center.
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:41.580]   Just sort of, it allows you to crank up the dose
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:43.560]   of the GLP-1 agonism even further
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:44.880]   while you're suppressing the nausea
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:47.440]   and just get even more weight loss.
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:49.400]   So now, talking about the future,
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:50.320]   things that aren't available yet
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.360]   but will be in the next couple of years.
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:54.800]   So Eli Lilly, the company that makes this drug,
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:59.160]   terzepatide/Mujaro, they have a triple agonist
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.720]   that's in phase three clinical trials now.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.220]   So this is now three hormones in one.
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:06.480]   It's the GLP-1, which all these drugs have,
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:09.480]   the GIP, which is the anti-nausea component,
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.320]   and then glucagon itself.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:14.240]   And so there's these three hormones all combined in one pill.
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.640]   And what the glucagon does
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:18.600]   is it increases energy expenditure.
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.880]   And this is a well-known effect of glucagon.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:23.240]   And so you're basically eating less,
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:24.520]   your nausea isn't as bad,
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:27.440]   and now you're just burning more calories at baseline.
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.660]   And the results from this drug are incredible.
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:32.120]   So basically, there's been one phase two trial published
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.080]   and people lost 25% of their body weight
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:38.440]   at the end of the, I think it was 48-week period,
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:39.460]   and they were still losing weight.
[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:41.000]   So we don't know where the end point,
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.560]   we don't know what the maximum is.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.480]   So there are bigger, longer trials going on now
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.320]   to figure that out.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:49.200]   But at that point, when you get beyond 25% body weight,
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.040]   you're talking about basically bariatric surgery, right?
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:52.480]   Which is currently the best thing we have,
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.720]   you know, like these surgeries people do to--
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:55.840]   - Stomach staples. - Stomach, yeah.
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:56.960]   - Removing a portion of the stomach.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:58.360]   - Removing a portion of the gut.
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:00.720]   So really, it's a pharmacologic version
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:02.560]   of bariatric surgery.
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.620]   The other one that I think is really exciting,
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.000]   there's this compound from Amgen,
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.560]   it's called, it's just right now, it's just a code,
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:09.760]   it's like AMG-133.
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:13.160]   But it's like terzapatide
[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:15.320]   in the sense that it targets both GLP-1 and GYP.
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:19.000]   So it's a dual-targeted.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.480]   But unlike terzapatide, which activates the GYP receptor,
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:24.480]   this Amgen compound inhibits it.
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:26.680]   And for reasons that people don't understand,
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.960]   either activating or inhibiting this receptor
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.220]   causes you to lose weight.
[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:31.560]   So it's still a mystery,
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:33.840]   but a lot of debate about what's going on there.
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:38.840]   But the way this Amgen compound activates the GYP receptor,
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:41.680]   or inhibits the GYP receptor, rather,
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:43.560]   is that it's an antibody.
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.780]   So all these other things were peptides,
[01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:46.200]   but this is a much bigger, it's actual protein,
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:47.960]   this is an antibody.
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:50.840]   And because it's an antibody, it has a much longer lifetime,
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:53.080]   even than something like semaglutide, which is seven days,
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.500]   so it lasts like a month in the blood or something.
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:57.800]   And so you can give people monthly injections of this,
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:00.440]   and they lose dramatic amounts of weight.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.940]   And then, at least in this initial trial,
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:04.400]   at the end of this, they stopped,
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.800]   and people maintained the weight loss for six months.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:07.640]   - That's impressive.
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:09.680]   - Potentially because of the long-lasting effects
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.560]   of this antibody, or potentially because of other things
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:12.840]   that we don't understand.
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.920]   So, and those are just two,
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.500]   there's all sorts of other crazy things happening.
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:18.120]   So really, I think it's just created this explosion
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:20.280]   of interest in pharma once.
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.260]   Basically, it's one of these things,
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:23.960]   once you see that something can be done,
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.120]   all of a sudden, that changes everyone's perspective.
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:29.120]   And so now, obesity drug discovery has gone from something
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:31.280]   that 10 years ago, everyone wanted to stay away from,
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:33.000]   because there were so many nightmare stories
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.960]   about drugs that turned out to be not safe.
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:37.640]   'Til now, everybody's sort of all in on this.
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:40.320]   - Yeah, I remember in college, the fen-fen debacle,
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.440]   where a diet drug was released,
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.200]   and people had cardiac issues, started dying,
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:45.200]   so it was pulled from market,
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:49.160]   and then it was essentially a quiet field for a long time.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:51.600]   In part, to bring us back into the brain,
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.920]   and in part because it's directly relevant
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.920]   to what we've been discussing about Ozempic and GLP-1,
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:04.320]   there are other neurons in the brain that regulate feeding,
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:09.440]   and there are other peptides involved in appetite control,
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.360]   for which I would say niche communities
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.320]   have started to indulge in.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:16.080]   And by the way, people were taking GLP-1 analogs
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.800]   long before they were FDA-approved
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:19.000]   in kind of niche communities.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.260]   These aren't communities I'm a part of,
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:21.560]   but every once in a while,
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.120]   I'll stick an ear into one of these communities
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.040]   and hear what people are taking.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:29.040]   And a big thing right now in these communities
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.640]   is the use of other peptides
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:36.040]   that are in the melanocyte-simulating hormone pathway.
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:41.040]   And you mentioned melanocortican receptor-containing neurons.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:45.800]   Could you tell us a little bit about what these neurons do
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:48.360]   in the absence of any pharmacologic stimulation,
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:52.800]   and then why it would be that people would perhaps
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:56.640]   stimulate these pathways with these drugs?
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:57.800]   Not that we're recommending that,
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:01.440]   but I do think that given that some of these neurons
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.840]   are also involved in sexual behavior
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.560]   and are FDA-approved for the treatment
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.920]   of hyposexual function in women, things like that,
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.160]   there is FDA approval for some of these compounds,
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:13.520]   that they're interesting hypothalamic neurons
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.600]   that are starting to gain more attention,
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:18.640]   and that I predict, based on their potential involvement
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:21.360]   in feeding appetite and weight control,
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.600]   are likely to enter the picture with more prominence
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:25.920]   in the not-too-distant future.
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.600]   - So alpha-MSH, as scientists call it,
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.240]   the hormone you were just referring to,
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:34.400]   is a product of the POMC gene.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:35.440]   So in the same way that we just talked about,
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:37.560]   glucagon can be processed into different things,
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:40.840]   and some cells, it's made into the glucagon hormone,
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.960]   and other cells, it's made into GLP-1.
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:45.320]   POMC, that gene can be processed
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:46.160]   to produce different hormones.
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:47.200]   And one is alpha-MSH,
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:49.080]   which is very important for feeding control.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.240]   And so these POMC neurons,
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:53.520]   they're in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus,
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.760]   the same region where these AGRP neurons
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.400]   I talked about earlier are located.
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:02.320]   And there's sort of these two sets of neurons
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.160]   that have opposing effects on body weight regulation.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:07.240]   And so alpha-MSH inhibits food intake,
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:09.360]   and AGRP neurons promote food intake.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:13.680]   And where they converge is at this receptor,
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:15.480]   the melanocortin-4 receptor,
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:19.120]   which is important for body weight regulation.
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:20.960]   And so alpha-MSH is an agonist.
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.440]   It turns on that receptor,
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.360]   and the AGRP peptide is an antagonist.
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:25.200]   It turns it off.
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:29.240]   And so there's a lot of human genetics,
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:30.520]   as I mentioned earlier,
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:34.320]   implicating this pathway in body weight regulation.
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.880]   There've been a lot of efforts over many years
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.440]   to turn alpha-MSH into a drug.
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:41.920]   And it's been very difficult.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:44.800]   There is one drug that's now approved.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.720]   It's called, I think, I'm gonna get the name wrong,
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:49.720]   it's like setmelanotide or something like this.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:51.520]   It's an MC4 receptor agonist.
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:55.320]   It's mainly used in relatively small populations of people
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.960]   that, for example, have mutations in this pathway.
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.520]   It's not used as a widespread, as a drug.
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:04.200]   And the challenge has been really side effects.
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:07.560]   So there's an increase in blood pressure that happens
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:08.520]   sometimes with these medicines,
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:12.240]   partly because this pathway controls not only appetite,
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.000]   but also autonomic tone
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.100]   and sympathetic nervous system activation.
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:21.880]   So it's just taking a step back
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:24.160]   from everything we've talked about today.
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:26.080]   I talked about this short-term system
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.080]   and the long-term system
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.960]   that controls energy balance and body weight.
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:30.760]   The long short-term system in the brainstem,
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.840]   the long-term system in the hypothalamus,
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:36.440]   the long-term system being leptin and alpha-MSH and AGRP.
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:38.760]   When I was coming up, learning about this stuff
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:40.240]   15 years ago or 20 years ago,
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:46.040]   the dogma was you could only affect body weight
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:47.780]   through the long-term system,
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:49.360]   by manipulating the long-term system.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:51.080]   Because any manipulation you did
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:53.000]   of the short-term system in the brainstem,
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.640]   the animal would just compensate.
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:55.900]   And there were these famous experiments
[01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:56.960]   where they would take CCK,
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.040]   which is a hormone just like GLP-1,
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.880]   inject it into rats, inject it several times a day.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:04.520]   And CCK is known to decrease the size of meals.
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:05.980]   And it would decrease the size of meals,
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:07.080]   but the rats would never lose any weight
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:08.720]   because they would just eat more meals to compensate.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:09.720]   And they would just perfectly compensate
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:10.800]   by eating more meals.
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:13.120]   And so the lore was, it's just impossible.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.240]   The animal will always compensate
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:17.080]   unless you hit this body weight set point regulating area,
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:19.480]   which is the hypothalamus, the long-term system.
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:22.200]   But then what the pharmaceutical industry discovered,
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.440]   which I guess maybe shouldn't be so surprising,
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:25.400]   but I guess it was to some people,
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:27.360]   is that if you just hit that receptor,
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.960]   that short-term system 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:32.680]   and never let it stop, then you will lose weight, right?
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:33.800]   And so the short-term system alone
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:36.360]   is enough to cause body weight regulation.
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.320]   On the other hand, the long-term system
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.240]   with alpha MSH and AGRP neurons and POMC
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:42.720]   and all this stuff has been a challenge
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:44.080]   to pharmaceutically target.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:48.120]   As you know, leptin we discussed didn't really work.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:51.900]   And so I think there's gonna be, as you mentioned,
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:53.200]   a re-emergence of interest
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:54.480]   in considering this other pathway
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:58.480]   now that we've seen the success of the GLP-1s.
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:00.680]   And I think one area where it may emerge
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:03.320]   is in considering their combination,
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:05.480]   perhaps at different stages of weight loss.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:08.680]   So perhaps, what would make a lot of sense scientifically,
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:10.340]   I don't know if it'll work in practice,
[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:13.040]   is that you would take a GLP-1 drug to lose the weight.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:15.400]   And then at some point you might stop that drug
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.840]   and switch to a more hypothalamus-centered
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.320]   leptin-based drug to keep the weight off.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.540]   So basically, use the GLP-1 drug
[01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:24.460]   to force yourself to lose the weight
[01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:27.180]   and then use the leptin hypothalamus-based drug
[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:29.380]   to sort of say, okay, this is our new body weight set point,
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:32.540]   let's not resist this weight loss that's happened.
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:33.780]   Whether that will actually make sense practically
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:35.260]   is hard to say because the GLP-1 drugs
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:37.060]   have just a lot of benefits, even beyond weight loss,
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:39.140]   so people might not wanna stop taking them.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:41.620]   But that's one idea.
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:42.620]   - Very interesting.
[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:45.580]   I'd love to talk about dopamine.
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:46.860]   - Sure.
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:48.540]   - We hear so much about dopamine,
[01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:50.060]   being involved in pleasure.
[01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:53.940]   I like to think I've had at least a small level of impact
[01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:56.980]   in convincing people that it's also involved in,
[01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:59.860]   perhaps mostly involved in things like motivation,
[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:00.920]   different forms of learning,
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.980]   and lots of other things too, folks.
[01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:04.060]   Dopamine does lots of things.
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:06.180]   It's even expressed in the eye,
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:07.580]   controls adaptation to light.
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:08.860]   So it does lots of things.
[01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:13.420]   But it certainly is believed that dopamine is involved
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:17.620]   in our either craving for food or pleasure from food.
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:19.900]   What's the real story on dopamine
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:22.340]   as it relates to food and eating behavior?
[01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:25.460]   You had a beautiful paper published in "Nature" entitled,
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:27.860]   and we'll put a link to this in the show note captions,
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:31.660]   "Dopamine Subsystems That Track Internal States."
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:34.220]   And I love this paper for a variety of reasons.
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:36.100]   But if you could give us the high points
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:39.060]   of your discoveries on dopamine as it relates to feeding,
[01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:41.260]   I think I know, in fact,
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:43.380]   that people would find it very illuminating.
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:44.740]   - Sure, fantastic.
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:48.580]   So, yeah, the question of what dopamine does
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:50.380]   with respect to feeding is a great question
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:52.580]   and a difficult question, I think, to answer.
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:54.420]   There's a lot of misconceptions.
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:56.500]   I think the evidence is dopamine
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:59.140]   probably isn't so much involved in the pleasure of food,
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:01.680]   that taste, the hedonic experience.
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:06.140]   One reason we think this is because you can make mice,
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:08.340]   that Richard Palminer did this decades ago,
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:09.580]   that don't have any dopamine,
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:12.540]   and they still show the same sort of effective responses
[01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:13.380]   to food.
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:14.200]   So you put something sweet in their mouth,
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:15.680]   psh, they like it, right?
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:19.140]   What dopamine seems to be important for
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:21.540]   with respect to food is two things.
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:25.140]   One is the motivation to engage in work to get food,
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:27.460]   particularly when it's high levels of effort.
[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:31.540]   So if you ask a mouse to press a lever
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:32.860]   to get a pellet of food,
[01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:35.620]   if it doesn't have any dopamine, it won't do it.
[01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:36.900]   And if it has low levels of dopamine,
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:37.860]   it'll just work a little bit.
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:40.620]   So dopamine is important for sort of energizing action
[01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:43.020]   and motivating you to engage in hard tasks.
[01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:44.700]   The other thing that dopamine
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:46.220]   is really important for is learning.
[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:48.100]   And it's important for learning about
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:51.340]   which cues predict something useful for the body.
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:54.500]   And feeding is a central example of that.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:57.260]   And what that paper of ours is about
[01:42:57.260 --> 01:42:59.540]   is the idea that this learning actually happens
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:02.980]   on two different timescales for two different kinds of cues.
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:05.900]   So what we almost always talk about with dopamine
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:07.500]   and learning, which is important,
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:10.340]   is learning about how external cues in the environment
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:12.600]   predict something like food availability, right?
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:14.700]   So you see a McDonald's sign and you know
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:18.340]   that that means there's some tasty food in there.
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:21.300]   And so dopamine is involved in that process
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:24.740]   of sort of learning what that external cue means.
[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:26.740]   And that's a very fast timescale process.
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:31.740]   So in the laboratory, for example, we will play a tone
[01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:35.120]   and then give an animal a sip of a solution
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.180]   that has calories in it, for example.
[01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:39.860]   And it can learn the association between that tone
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:41.540]   and that the food is going to be available
[01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:43.900]   if they're separated by a few seconds, but that's all.
[01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:46.100]   And that's a dopamine-dependent process.
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:50.580]   But there's a second sort of much slower timescale
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:52.380]   learning about food, which isn't about where I go
[01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:55.140]   to get a hamburger, but rather about what the experience
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:57.060]   of eating the food, the aural sensory experience,
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:59.260]   its taste, its flavor, its texture,
[01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:01.380]   how that relates to the post-ingestive effects.
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:03.580]   - And I should say that this seems extremely relevant
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:05.080]   to the McDonald's example,
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:08.740]   because in your experimental situation,
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:10.860]   the tone is analogous to the golden arches
[01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:12.220]   of the McDonald's sign. - Exactly.
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:15.440]   - But in my experience, and forgive me,
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:18.220]   but most of the food that I've consumed from McDonald's
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:21.700]   does not taste good relative to other
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:24.080]   like really delicious hamburgers or French fries
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:25.380]   or something like that.
[01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:29.540]   I mean, it's, so you're saying dopamine is required
[01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:32.620]   to link the signal, the golden arches or the tone
[01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:35.540]   to the presence of food at a particular location.
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:36.380]   - Exactly.
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:39.500]   - But not to the experience of pleasure from that food.
[01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:40.340]   - Exactly.
[01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:42.180]   - Which wears very well with my experience of McDonald's.
[01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:44.020]   And I probably haven't had a bite of McDonald's
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:47.100]   in 20 plus years.
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:47.940]   - Yeah.
[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:49.060]   - I would have to be pretty hungry.
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:49.880]   - I haven't either.
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:52.460]   And it's funny, the golden arches thing
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:54.140]   is just something that people in neuroscience talks
[01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:55.100]   about dopamine use.
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:56.540]   And so now I've started subconsciously
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:57.660]   just talking about golden arches,
[01:44:57.660 --> 01:44:59.780]   even though I also haven't eaten McDonald's in decades.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:02.300]   - In and out burgers, better tasting,
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:04.160]   from what I understand, probably better sourcing.
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:05.740]   We're not gonna get into all of this in detail,
[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:07.380]   but everyone has their preferences.
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:09.520]   But I do think it's interesting
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:12.500]   because what we're talking about here is related,
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:14.980]   I think, to this notion of highly processed food,
[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:17.540]   packaging, the commoditization of food,
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:20.260]   just the idea that we are drawn to food for things
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:23.580]   other than the taste that we expect for it.
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:24.740]   There's all this context.
[01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:25.580]   - That's right.
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:28.920]   So I think an important distinction that people make
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:31.160]   is the distinction between wanting and liking.
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:32.420]   I don't know if you've talked about this previously
[01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:33.260]   on the podcast.
[01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:34.740]   - Anna Lembke, my colleague at Stanford
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:36.580]   came on the podcast, talked about dopamine
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:38.900]   is about wanting as opposed to enjoying.
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:39.740]   - Exactly.
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:40.560]   - In most cases.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.160]   - Yeah, so liking is the subjective hedonic pleasure
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.220]   in the moment of eating it,
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:46.340]   but wanting is just what's what you want.
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:48.520]   And this can be uncoupled all the time.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.180]   You can want things that at the end of the day,
[01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:51.460]   you don't actually enjoy it when you get it.
[01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:52.940]   I feel like a lot of life is like that.
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:53.780]   - Indeed.
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:58.780]   - And so dopamine is very powerful
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:02.360]   at making you want something, but not necessarily like it.
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:03.200]   So that's one element.
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:05.380]   But then there's this other element that is important,
[01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:06.900]   but very much less studied,
[01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:08.840]   but I find much more interesting,
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:12.260]   which is how you connect the sensory cues
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:16.060]   associated with food, its taste, its flavor, its smell,
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:18.380]   with the consequences for the body.
[01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:22.340]   And this is so important because so much of whether we like
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:24.940]   or dislike a particular food or drink
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:26.820]   is related to its post-ingestive effects.
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:29.260]   You come to like things, for example, that have calories.
[01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:31.620]   So this is one of the reasons that adults will eat vegetables
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:34.200]   and other savory foods that children find disgusting.
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:35.500]   Even though they're a little bit bitter,
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:36.340]   you learn through experience,
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:37.480]   this makes me feel good to eat this.
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:40.100]   And even maybe at a completely subconscious level,
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:43.120]   there's also a level of learning that occurs.
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:45.100]   And this, of course, happens with other things like coffee
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:47.500]   and beer and other things like that.
[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:49.280]   And so there's been an idea
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.620]   that this other much slower learning occurs.
[01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:52.580]   And the reason I say it's slower
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:55.020]   is because the time between when you taste the food
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:56.420]   and when it actually gets into your intestine
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:58.540]   and releases the hormones that might drive this
[01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:01.260]   is quite slow, separated by tens of minutes.
[01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:02.980]   But how that works hasn't been clear.
[01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:06.360]   There's been an idea that dopamine might be involved,
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.580]   but it hadn't really received a lot of attention.
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:10.300]   And so we set out to investigate
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:11.400]   what is the role of dopamine
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:12.940]   in these post-ingestive responses
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:15.100]   and sort of map out for the dopamine system,
[01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:16.460]   how does the dopamine system respond,
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:18.720]   not when you see the golden arches,
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:20.340]   which is usually the kinds of experiments
[01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:21.180]   that have been performed,
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:22.620]   but rather when you deliver nutrients
[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:23.820]   directly to your stomach,
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:25.780]   or when you deliver water directly to your stomach
[01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:27.940]   if you're thirsty and so on.
[01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:30.020]   And what we saw was that there are these different
[01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:31.780]   populations of dopamine neurons
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:35.200]   that are tuned to respond to signals from inside the body.
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:37.580]   And so there are some that respond when nutrients
[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:39.220]   are in the stomach and intestine.
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:43.540]   There are others that respond in a thirsty mouse
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:45.180]   when the blood is rehydrated,
[01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:47.140]   when you basically satiate your thirst.
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:51.340]   And we showed that the purpose,
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:53.420]   or at least a purpose of that activation
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:56.740]   is to cause you to learn about the effects
[01:47:56.740 --> 01:47:57.580]   of what you just ate,
[01:47:57.580 --> 01:47:58.940]   basically to create this connection
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:00.500]   between the flavor of something
[01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:01.860]   and its post-ingestive effects.
[01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:04.920]   So that sort of, that delayed dopamine signal
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.380]   after ingested food and fluids
[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:08.000]   is sort of reinforcing this connection
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.400]   between the flavor of what I just ate
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:11.200]   and that it was something good for me.
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:13.400]   One of the sort of interesting things about that paper
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:16.120]   that was not the direction we initially expected to go in
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.240]   is that for food, I think it's kind of intuitive.
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:20.440]   There are lots of flavors to food.
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:24.280]   You have to learn what all these different flavors mean.
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:26.200]   For thirst, people find it a little less obvious
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:27.960]   because thirst is just water.
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:30.780]   Aren't you just born knowing what water is?
[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:32.040]   Like how do you have to learn anything
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:34.560]   to do with drinking a glass of water?
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:37.760]   But it actually is a learning question in part
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:41.000]   because for many animals, probably most animals,
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.680]   thirst is something that's associated with eating,
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:44.840]   not drinking.
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:48.840]   There's this study I love of rabbits in New Zealand.
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:51.300]   So there's not a lot of people studying what animals,
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:52.400]   how they get their fluids in the wild,
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.380]   'cause who cares, but it's kind of interesting.
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:57.160]   And so in New Zealand, there's this huge rabbit problem
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.720]   'cause they're an invasive pest species
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:00.560]   that was introduced in the 1800s
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:02.120]   and they're just eating all the land.
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:04.480]   And so there's lots of money to study rabbits,
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:06.480]   to understand their ecology.
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.640]   And so a group of researchers did this experiment
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:10.520]   where they made this big pen outside
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:11.640]   where they put a bunch of rabbits in this.
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:12.480]   The rabbits couldn't escape,
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:13.520]   but they had all their natural food.
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:15.200]   It was like an outdoor area.
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:17.020]   And they also put a trough of water.
[01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:18.840]   So the rats always had access to water,
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:19.880]   which is a clean water,
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:22.840]   and they could measure how much water the rabbits drank.
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.320]   And what they basically found is that nine months
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.600]   out of a year, rabbits drink zero water.
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:27.720]   They drink absolutely zero
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:30.280]   because they get all of their water from food.
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:32.680]   The only time they drink is during the winter
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:35.220]   when all of the greenery has sort of become shriveled
[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:38.280]   and then they can't get water from that anymore.
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:39.880]   And so it's just kind of interesting aspect
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:41.920]   of how many animals are very different
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:43.560]   from the way we think about ingestive behavior.
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:47.240]   But that fact that animals have to get water from food
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:48.120]   raises this question,
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:50.800]   how do they know which foods are rehydrating?
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:52.200]   Presumably they have to learn that
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:53.520]   because you can't just look at a food
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:55.480]   and say if you've never had any experience,
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:57.440]   oh yeah, this is something that's very water rich
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:58.880]   and this will rehydrate me when I'm thirsty
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:00.640]   and this one is not.
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:03.440]   And so James, the graduate student who led this project,
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:09.000]   basically investigated this by giving mice different fluids
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.360]   and then measuring the dopamine response.
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.440]   And he showed there was this delayed dopamine response
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.560]   after the mice had drank the fluids
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:18.920]   that correlated with rehydration of the blood.
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:20.120]   So a whole bunch of dopamine neurons
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:23.240]   get strongly activated when the blood is rehydrated.
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:25.560]   And he hypothesized this might be a signal,
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:28.240]   this delayed activation of dopamine neurons
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:30.200]   that allows animals in the wild to learn
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:34.480]   that food I just ate is rehydrating.
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:36.080]   And so he did an experiment
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:38.380]   where he basically gave them two different flavors,
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:41.260]   mimicking sort of the flavors of two different foods,
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:43.160]   one of which was hydrating and one of which was not.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:44.000]   And the animals couldn't tell
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.620]   because he infused the water directly into their stomach.
[01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:49.920]   And he showed that basically these dopamine neurons
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:52.520]   are critical for them learning that association.
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:54.040]   So that's the story of that.
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:55.760]   - I love it and I'll tell you why.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:59.760]   When I was in college, for reasons that I don't recall,
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:01.760]   I decided to run an experiment on myself
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:05.480]   where I would eat one meal
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:08.800]   that was fairly low water content,
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:11.640]   like a piece of meat or something with some cheese,
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:13.360]   you know, what some people call a keto meal,
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:14.740]   but I wasn't ketogenic.
[01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:15.580]   I don't even think I knew
[01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:18.040]   what a ketogenic diet was at that point.
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:18.860]   And then the next meal,
[01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:21.960]   I would have like a salad and some fruits.
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:23.960]   And then I would switch back and forth.
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:27.160]   And I generally would only eat two or three times a day.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:30.000]   You know, anyway, there's only so many hours in the day.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.940]   And I found it to be incredibly satiating.
[01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:35.840]   And I found that I felt great.
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:39.260]   And I can imagine any number of different reasons for that.
[01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:41.160]   And there are these theories that you probably recall
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:45.660]   that the diet that was being promoted in the '90s
[01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:47.440]   where people would either eat carbohydrates
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:48.640]   or protein separately.
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:50.120]   Like there was some wackiness out there.
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:51.080]   And as I say that,
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:52.520]   I'm sure I'll get assaulted in the comments.
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:53.400]   It's probably not wacky.
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:55.640]   I'm sure there's some enzymatic basis
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:56.560]   for why that would be useful.
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:58.200]   If you enjoy it, go for it.
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:01.560]   You know, I don't have a feeling about it
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:02.400]   one way or the other.
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:04.700]   But one thing I noticed was that
[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:09.540]   low water content containing meals,
[01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:13.120]   either by virtue of the foods that they include
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:15.560]   or by virtue of the fact that they're not diluted,
[01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:16.400]   so to speak,
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:21.560]   it's a different taste experience to eat those foods
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:23.360]   than it is to eat like a big salad
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:25.220]   or something of that sort.
[01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:27.320]   In any event, I don't do that any longer.
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:30.040]   I just sort of stopped, but it was a fun experiment.
[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:32.160]   And I think it was efficient
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:34.200]   because at the time I had very low money as a student.
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:36.380]   So, you know, generally fruits and vegetables
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:38.180]   were less costly than meats and things of that sort.
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:40.500]   But in all seriousness,
[01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:46.340]   to what extent do you think humans overeat or undereat
[01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:48.340]   depending on the water content of the food?
[01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:49.580]   - It's an interesting question.
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:51.500]   So, you know, there is this advice
[01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:53.340]   that you should, if you're hungry,
[01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:55.540]   first drink something, drink some water
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:57.060]   and see if you're still hungry.
[01:52:57.060 --> 01:53:02.060]   And the idea is that perhaps humans can't always,
[01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:04.700]   I mean, our interoceptive sense,
[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:07.020]   our ability to sense what our body needs is not perfect.
[01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:08.500]   And sometimes we could be confused
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:10.180]   and we could really be thirsty when we're hungry
[01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:11.860]   and hungry when we're thirsty.
[01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:14.260]   And there's some evidence that that could help.
[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:17.660]   I would say it's probably not a huge effect
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:19.080]   in most of modern day life,
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:23.820]   but it's an interesting idea, yeah.
[01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:25.700]   - This brings us to the topic of thirst,
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:27.980]   something that your laboratory has worked on extensively
[01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:32.780]   and the topic of osmolarity of salt consumption
[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:33.980]   and things of that sort.
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:38.500]   In broad terms, how do these things link up?
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:41.880]   Meaning, are there instances in which
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:43.420]   what we really need is salt
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:46.300]   and we end up eating a bunch of Parmesan cheese?
[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:47.620]   I got teased yesterday by my team
[01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:48.940]   because occasionally when I'm on the road,
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:50.560]   I don't like most of the foods available
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:51.500]   in most airports and stuff.
[01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:53.820]   So I'll bring a chunk of really nice Parmesan cheese.
[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:55.380]   I just break off a piece and eat it.
[01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:58.580]   I'll have half a cucumber and I'll have a can of,
[01:53:58.580 --> 01:53:59.460]   not a can of tuna,
[01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:02.420]   but there are these wonderful jarred filet of tunas
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:03.920]   that are available that are in olive oil.
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:05.040]   They taste really good.
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:07.220]   This is not canned tuna, it's really good.
[01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:10.580]   And I'd rather eat that in most cases
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:13.660]   until I can get to a decent meal
[01:54:13.660 --> 01:54:16.660]   than like what's put in front of me on an airplane,
[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:18.180]   most of the time.
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:19.180]   So I get teased about this,
[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:21.200]   but I notice that for instance,
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:23.060]   sometimes I'll eat the cheese and I think,
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:25.460]   oh, actually what I really just want is the salt.
[01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:26.300]   - Yeah.
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:27.120]   - I really want the salt.
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:28.820]   I've been drinking a lot of coffee today.
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:30.500]   I've had a couple extra glasses of water.
[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:32.900]   Maybe I'm just craving salt and I'm confused
[01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:35.220]   and I'm over consuming this cheese.
[01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:36.060]   - Yes.
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:38.140]   - When in fact, what I'm going for is the salt.
[01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:39.980]   As you point out,
[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:44.100]   our understanding of exactly what we need is fairly crude
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:46.420]   and oftentimes we overshoot the margin,
[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:48.780]   especially when foods are in combination.
[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:53.780]   So salt, water, and let's just say calories.
[01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:59.540]   How do we accurately or inaccurately pursue those
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:01.100]   at the level of biology?
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:02.220]   - Okay.
[01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:03.060]   So I was-
[01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:03.900]   - You're throwing tough questions at me.
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:04.740]   - I know, this feels-
[01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:05.780]   - But you're-
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:07.380]   - Feels like my qualifying exam.
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:11.300]   So, well, there are separate systems.
[01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:12.500]   There's thought to be separate systems
[01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:15.620]   that control salt appetite, thirst for water
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:17.460]   and hunger for calories.
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:19.540]   And so they involve different brain regions
[01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:21.100]   for the most part, different neurons,
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:22.740]   different signals from the body.
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:28.380]   In general, hunger and thirst are pretty separable.
[01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:31.060]   I would say the instance where they interact
[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:34.500]   is in phenomena such as dehydration anorexia.
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:37.340]   This is the idea that if I give you some dry food
[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:38.860]   but I don't give you any water,
[01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:40.940]   you're gonna eat less food
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:42.540]   because basically you're gonna get dehydrated
[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:44.660]   and you're gonna decide I need to preserve
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:47.860]   my fluid balance even if I eat less calories.
[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:51.500]   - So we prioritize hydration.
[01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:52.780]   - Yes, you will at some point-
[01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:53.620]   - The level of survival.
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:56.340]   - At some point you will prioritize hydration.
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:58.660]   That's related also to the concept of prandial drinking.
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:55:59.940]   So many animals, including humans,
[01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:01.380]   drink most of their water during meals
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:02.740]   because you basically wanna counteract
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:04.540]   the osmolites that are in your food.
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:08.780]   Salt balance though, and then thirst,
[01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:11.460]   so the thirst for water and the desire for salt
[01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:12.740]   are much more tightly linked
[01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:15.780]   because the purpose of both systems
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:18.540]   is to maintain the composition of the blood
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:19.820]   at its right concentration.
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:22.780]   So you want to have the right osmolality of the blood,
[01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:24.420]   which you can just think of in simple terms
[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:27.740]   as sort of the total concentration of all the salts.
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:30.300]   It's a little more complicated than that,
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:31.500]   but it doesn't really matter.
[01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:35.220]   And you also specifically need to maintain
[01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:37.460]   the sodium concentration at the right level.
[01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:42.300]   And there are really powerful innate mechanisms
[01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:43.140]   that drive both.
[01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:45.260]   I think thirst is very intuitive to people.
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:48.580]   You get dehydrated, you lose water, you become thirsty.
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:53.980]   And we know now that there are a very small set of neurons
[01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:56.540]   in a few brain regions that control that.
[01:56:56.540 --> 01:57:01.100]   And the way they're thought to work
[01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:02.980]   is they contain osmosensors.
[01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:05.020]   So they contain basically,
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:07.500]   these neurons are sensors for the osmolality of the blood,
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:09.300]   and they're activated when the blood osmolality
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:10.140]   gets too high.
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:11.820]   And it's an incredibly sensitive system.
[01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:15.420]   So you can perceive an increase in your blood osmolality
[01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:17.860]   of 1% as the sensation of thirst.
[01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:20.020]   So remarkable, yeah.
[01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:22.060]   - That's how critical it is to maintain salt balance.
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:23.340]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:26.700]   And so you get to 10% increase in blood osmolality,
[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:28.020]   and you're in extreme discomfort,
[01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:29.540]   and 20% you're like in the hospital.
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:34.540]   - So if I took, let's just say a half an ounce sip
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:40.820]   of seawater inadvertently, it's extremely aversive.
[01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:42.180]   - It is.
[01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:43.740]   - It's like, like you just,
[01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:47.260]   you want to drink some non-salty water,
[01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:48.580]   some nice clean water.
[01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:49.500]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:50.380]   - Immediately.
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:51.220]   - Yeah.
[01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:53.960]   So I should emphasize that there's two components
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:55.180]   to the fluid homeostasis system,
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:57:56.780]   to the water homeostasis system.
[01:57:56.780 --> 01:57:58.180]   One is this desire to drink.
[01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:01.140]   But the other is, of course, the kidney.
[01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:03.260]   And so the reason that drinking the salt water
[01:58:03.260 --> 01:58:05.180]   won't put you in a really bad situation
[01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:07.260]   is your kidney would then filter out a lot of that salt
[01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:10.340]   and cause you just to pee it out, and then you'd be fine.
[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:11.500]   And so those two work in balance.
[01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:13.060]   The kidney's controlling how much of the salt
[01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:14.580]   gets reabsorbed into the blood,
[01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:17.780]   and then this desire for thirst, this desire to drink,
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:19.700]   allowing you to replenish the blood with water
[01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:21.040]   at various intervals.
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:25.580]   And so, yeah, I mean, the experiments led to the discovery
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:26.700]   of this thirst circuitry are amazing.
[01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:29.540]   It was this guy, Bengt Andersen, working in the 1950s,
[01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:31.180]   and he just had this hypothesis
[01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:33.420]   that there was an osmosensor in the brain, right?
[01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:35.500]   Which is very, I think, you know,
[01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:36.580]   there was some evidence to suggest it,
[01:58:36.580 --> 01:58:38.980]   but it was not really, really strongly supported
[01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:40.380]   at the time by the data.
[01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:41.740]   And so he took these goats,
[01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:44.820]   and he just started infusing small amounts of salt
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:46.340]   into various places in their brain,
[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:48.260]   reasoning that if there was an osmosensor-
[01:58:48.260 --> 01:58:50.220]   - Sorry to chuckle, I was wild.
[01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:53.020]   I mean, I wasn't chuckling in jest,
[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:54.820]   like, you know, I feel for the goats,
[01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:56.460]   I feel for everyone involved in that experiment,
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:58:57.780]   but what a wild experiment,
[01:58:57.780 --> 01:58:59.980]   just to put salt directly into the brain?
[01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:02.020]   - Concentrated saline solution, yeah.
[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:03.920]   And he found this tiny region in and around
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:07.980]   the hypothalamus that if you infuse salt in this region,
[01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:10.500]   the goats will drink like eight liters of water
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:12.860]   in five minutes, just crazy, right?
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:15.580]   And so he reasoned, okay, this must be the osmosensor.
[01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:18.380]   And then he went back and stimulated those neurons.
[01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:19.220]   It's just the same thing.
[01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:20.980]   The goat just drinks like crazy.
[01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:23.260]   And so now we know there's this couple small regions
[01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:24.420]   in and around the hypothalamus.
[01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:26.100]   One's called the subfornicle organ,
[01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:27.940]   another one's called, well, it doesn't really matter,
[01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:31.940]   but basically, that have these osmosensors.
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:32.940]   One of the interesting things
[01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:34.440]   about the regulation of fluid balance
[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:35.980]   is you face some of the same challenges
[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:37.260]   we just talked about with the regulation
[01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:39.700]   of food consumption, which is that you have this behavior,
[01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:44.660]   this ingestive behavior, that leads to replenishment
[01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:46.660]   of the body, but there are these delays, right?
[01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:48.600]   So if you're thirsty and you drink a glass of water,
[01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:51.140]   it can take on the order of sort of 20 to 30 minutes
[01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:53.300]   for the water to be absorbed into your blood,
[01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:54.820]   for the blood to be rehydrated,
[01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:56.980]   and then for these osmosensors that Bank to Anderson
[01:59:56.980 --> 02:00:01.620]   discovered in your brain to be sort of sense that
[02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:03.500]   and return to normal activity.
[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:04.580]   But of course, if you had the experience
[02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:05.520]   of drinking a glass of water,
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:08.020]   you know that you can quench your thirst within minutes,
[02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:11.100]   right, and so how does that work within seconds even?
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:13.360]   So one of the other sort of experiments
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:17.060]   we did early in my lab was to ask that question,
[02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:18.660]   by basically recording for the first time
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:20.580]   the activity of these neurons that Bank had discovered
[02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:21.700]   by putting the salt in the ghost.
[02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:22.860]   We went back into them now in mice,
[02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:24.940]   mice have the same neurons, you have the same neurons,
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:26.960]   and recording their activity when a thirsty mice drinks,
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:28.020]   it asks what happens.
[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:31.880]   And what we saw was that the neurons don't wait
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:34.900]   until the blood is rehydrated.
[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:36.700]   They also don't do what the AGRP neurons do,
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:38.140]   is meaning they don't look at the water
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:40.200]   and predict how much water they're gonna drink.
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:42.500]   But instead, they get a signal from the mouth,
[02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:44.300]   which every time the mouse takes a lick of water,
[02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:46.140]   their activity goes down a little bit.
[02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:48.060]   And basically, they track in that way
[02:00:48.060 --> 02:00:51.140]   the volume of water that's passed through the mouth.
[02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:53.380]   They also get the signal from the blood,
[02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:54.740]   really relaying the osmolarity of the blood,
[02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:55.780]   and they compare these two.
[02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:57.820]   And basically, when the mouse has drank enough
[02:00:57.820 --> 02:01:00.840]   in order for the animal to predict
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:03.020]   that the blood osmolality is going to return to normal,
[02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:04.260]   then the animal stops drinking.
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:05.540]   - Beautiful.
[02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:06.380]   - Yeah.
[02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:07.200]   - It's just beautiful, right?
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:08.040]   - It's incredible.
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:09.940]   - I was like, the brain is essentially predicting
[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:11.940]   with, it sounds like a high degree of accuracy,
[02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:13.700]   how much water one needs to drink,
[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:18.700]   linking it to the pleasure of ingesting good, clean water
[02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:21.340]   under conditions where we're thirsty,
[02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:24.900]   in anticipation of adjusting blood osmolarity in 20 minutes.
[02:01:24.900 --> 02:01:25.740]   - Exactly.
[02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:28.460]   - I mean, it's, yeah, I mean,
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:30.700]   this is the kind of thing that just, it delights me,
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:33.620]   because it just means that the brain, as a predictive organ,
[02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:37.020]   is just, is so accurate.
[02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:40.620]   - It also explains some sort of funny aspects of thirst
[02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:42.140]   that you may have noticed from everyday experience.
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:46.140]   So, you know, one idea is that just cooling your mouth
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:48.500]   can sort of quench your thirst, right?
[02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:49.420]   So if you're in the hospital
[02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:50.740]   and you're not allowed to drink any fluids,
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:52.140]   they'll give you ice chips to suck on
[02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:52.980]   to sort of quench your thirst.
[02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:54.580]   So why is that?
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:56.660]   And so one idea is that perhaps,
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:01:59.060]   because water is usually cooler than your body,
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:00.540]   that sensation of water passing,
[02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:02.160]   it always cools your mouth, and so you learn,
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:04.340]   or maybe it's innate, that just cooling of my mouth
[02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:07.460]   means that basically I'm gonna be rehydrated.
[02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:09.220]   So Chris, this was an experiment done by a graduate student,
[02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:11.260]   Chris Zimmerman, Chris did the same thing
[02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:13.260]   where he was recording these thirst neurons,
[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:15.540]   but he put a cold piece of metal on the mouse's tongue.
[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:16.500]   And you can see when you do that,
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:18.060]   these thirst neurons go down in activity,
[02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:19.340]   and then you remove the cold piece of metal
[02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:20.180]   and they go back up.
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:21.000]   - Amazing.
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.740]   - So a lot of these sort of oddities of everyday experience
[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:25.820]   have to do with how the system has evolved
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:26.980]   to make the prediction
[02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:29.220]   about what's going to happen to the body.
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:32.140]   - I mean, few things are as rewarding
[02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:36.820]   as the sensation of drinking really nice, clean, cold water
[02:02:36.820 --> 02:02:38.540]   when one is very thirsty.
[02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:39.900]   When my lab was in San Diego,
[02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:42.580]   I used to take my dog hiking in Palomar Mountain,
[02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:44.500]   and one day, you know, I really screwed up.
[02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:47.140]   He was a bulldog mastiff, they overheat easily,
[02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:49.700]   and it was a lot warmer than we thought.
[02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:50.700]   We ran out of water.
[02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:53.200]   It was a actually dangerous situation for him.
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:54.580]   We got down to the bottom of the hill,
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:55.980]   thankfully, with him still alive,
[02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:58.340]   and there's this pump that pumps
[02:02:58.340 --> 02:03:00.740]   what I was told was spring water,
[02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:02.740]   and it came out, you know, really cold,
[02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:07.060]   and you could just see him fill back up with life.
[02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:08.280]   I filled back up with life
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:09.940]   knowing he was filling back up with life,
[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:12.700]   and it was unlike the kind of reward
[02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:14.820]   that one experiences with food when you're hungry.
[02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:15.660]   - Absolutely.
[02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:18.900]   - It's like that basic critical need for water
[02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:19.900]   - Absolutely.
[02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:22.340]   - under conditions where you're clearly dehydrated
[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:23.620]   is like nothing else.
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:27.180]   It's delicious in a way that no food is delicious.
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:28.340]   - I would like to actually say something about this.
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:30.340]   So that distinction you made is really interesting
[02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:32.100]   between hunger and thirst.
[02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:34.340]   So when you stimulate these neurons
[02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:36.580]   that make an animal thirsty, the mice hate it.
[02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:38.500]   They will do anything to avoid something
[02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:40.060]   that artificially makes them thirsty.
[02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:41.660]   So we can artificially stimulate these thirst neurons,
[02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:43.860]   create a state of virtual thirst.
[02:03:43.860 --> 02:03:46.780]   They'll lever press hundreds of times to make it stop.
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:48.900]   The same neurons, the neurons I talked about
[02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:51.180]   that control hunger, the AGRP neurons,
[02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:52.940]   they actually don't care so much.
[02:03:52.940 --> 02:03:55.500]   They won't really do much of anything to shut them off.
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:56.340]   That raises the question, well,
[02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:58.140]   why do the animals eat then
[02:03:58.140 --> 02:03:59.420]   when you stimulate the hunger neurons?
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:00.500]   And we think the primary thing
[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.380]   that the hunger neuron stimulation does
[02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:04.020]   is it make food itself more attractive.
[02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:05.380]   It makes the food more delicious,
[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:08.140]   more of an attractive motivational magnet.
[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:10.260]   It makes the experience of eating more pleasurable,
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:12.820]   but it is not itself the most unpleasant state.
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:14.900]   At least the mice aren't willing to do that much.
[02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:17.580]   Whereas for thirst, I think dehydration and thirst
[02:04:17.580 --> 02:04:18.660]   is really just unpleasant,
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:20.100]   and animals just want to avoid that.
[02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:22.900]   And so I think that distinction is very real.
[02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:24.900]   I think there are two different motivational mechanisms
[02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:25.740]   for hunger and thirst.
[02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:27.980]   Hunger is mostly about the reward of food.
[02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:30.900]   Thirst is mostly about, this is just really unpleasant.
[02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:32.460]   - And removing that unpleasant.
[02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:33.300]   - Exactly.
[02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:35.300]   - And you had a paper, which I was going to ask you about,
[02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:37.680]   so I will, entitled "The Forebrain Thirst Circuit
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:40.060]   "Drives Drinking Through Negative Reinforcement."
[02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:41.120]   - Yes.
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:43.020]   - And I'm guessing that paper
[02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:44.940]   illustrates exactly the point you just made.
[02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:47.160]   So it's a forebrain circuit.
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:48.820]   So does that mean that there's some elements
[02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:50.620]   of learning and cognition around this?
[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:52.340]   Or are we broadly speaking about the forebrain,
[02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:55.060]   for instance, the hypothalamus being in the forebrain?
[02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:56.220]   - So, yeah, it's interesting.
[02:04:56.220 --> 02:04:59.000]   So the thirst circuit, for whatever reason,
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.500]   is mostly in the forebrain.
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:02.420]   So the neurons that,
[02:05:02.420 --> 02:05:05.000]   so we talked about the NTS and the areopostrema
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.840]   being important for hunger and signals from the gut.
[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:11.900]   Those are, the areopostrema is a circumventricular organ,
[02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:13.220]   meaning it's outside the blood-brain barrier.
[02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:15.260]   There's only a couple of these in the brain.
[02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:16.780]   The neurons that control thirst
[02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:19.220]   are located in the two circumventricular organs
[02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:20.440]   in the forebrain.
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:22.140]   One is called the subfornical organ,
[02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:23.660]   the other one is called the OVLT,
[02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:25.100]   but they're just acronyms.
[02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:28.780]   But so why it evolved to have the thirst neurons
[02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:29.820]   more in the forebrain
[02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:32.860]   and the neurons that sense nutrients more in the hindbrain
[02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:34.460]   is a little bit unclear.
[02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:37.020]   And so there is definitely an element of learning,
[02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:38.840]   but a lot of this is those neurons
[02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:40.380]   are also just directly sensing the blood
[02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:43.020]   and sensing changes in both the concentration of salt
[02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:45.100]   in the blood and then also hormones like angiotensin
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:46.620]   that drive thirst.
[02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:48.160]   - I was going to ask you this earlier,
[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:49.940]   but it seems appropriate to ask now.
[02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:53.140]   A colleague of mine at Stanford in the psychology department,
[02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:56.420]   Dr. Allie Crum, who studies mindsets,
[02:05:56.420 --> 02:05:58.340]   has done some interesting experiments
[02:05:58.340 --> 02:06:00.860]   where people are told that a given milkshake
[02:06:00.860 --> 02:06:03.320]   is calorically dense.
[02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:06.680]   Other people are told that a milkshake is calorically sparse.
[02:06:06.680 --> 02:06:10.980]   Both groups independently consume the milkshake
[02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:15.140]   and then they measure things like hormone responses
[02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:17.340]   in the bloodstream that are associated with satiety.
[02:06:17.340 --> 02:06:22.340]   And what she finds is that even hormone responses
[02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:26.140]   to the same shake, meaning the same amount of calories,
[02:06:26.140 --> 02:06:30.260]   fat, sugar, et cetera, can be significantly modulated
[02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:32.240]   based on what we're told.
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:35.740]   And it extends into some other,
[02:06:35.740 --> 02:06:38.980]   perhaps even more interesting areas in my opinion,
[02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:41.180]   whereby if people are told that,
[02:06:41.180 --> 02:06:44.980]   let's say a given meal that has a small piece of fish,
[02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:49.100]   serving of vegetables and a carbohydrate is yes,
[02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:50.900]   perhaps a little bit calorically sparse
[02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:53.820]   compared to what one would normally eat at a given meal,
[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:56.500]   but they're told this is a highly nutritious meal.
[02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:57.820]   This is good for you.
[02:06:57.820 --> 02:07:02.820]   Then just that mere knowledge can drive more satiety,
[02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:05.160]   better feelings about the meal.
[02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:08.060]   Even, I believe, I have to double check on this,
[02:07:08.060 --> 02:07:10.720]   but as I recall, a heightened sense
[02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:12.360]   of it tasting really good.
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:17.360]   So humans are very susceptible to the,
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:19.820]   in this case, the either inaccurate,
[02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:21.540]   in the case of the milkshake experiment,
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:24.220]   or accurate descriptions of food,
[02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:26.460]   meaning they shape our perception
[02:07:26.460 --> 02:07:29.100]   of whether or not something is good for us,
[02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:32.340]   tastes good or not, and whether or not
[02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:35.380]   it leads to more or less satiety.
[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:38.620]   And I think this is important given the obesity crisis,
[02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:41.620]   you know, to say nothing of these drugs that are coming out,
[02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:43.940]   whereby people often associate dieting
[02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:45.840]   with deprivation and pain,
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:49.300]   but if they understand that certain foods are nutritious,
[02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:51.340]   that can at least partially offset
[02:07:51.340 --> 02:07:54.580]   some of the pain of caloric restriction.
[02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:56.860]   What are your thoughts on that?
[02:07:56.860 --> 02:08:00.260]   - Yeah, well, one thing I've been talking about
[02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:02.740]   is how a lot of these circuits are anticipatory.
[02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:03.960]   They're making predictions.
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:06.740]   They're trying to estimate what's happening in the future.
[02:08:06.740 --> 02:08:09.280]   And I talked about how these AGRP hunger neurons,
[02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:11.060]   how they can sort of see the food
[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:13.820]   or get input about the sight, smell of food,
[02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:15.420]   and that way predict how many calories
[02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:16.700]   the mouse is going to eat.
[02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:18.780]   But, I mean, this is a mouse, right?
[02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:19.660]   This is all based on a mouse.
[02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:21.780]   A mouse has, you know, 1,000 times fewer neurons
[02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:23.380]   than you do as a person, right?
[02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:25.900]   So the computational capacity that the human brain has
[02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:28.500]   to make these predictions is just vast
[02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:29.340]   compared to these mice.
[02:08:29.340 --> 02:08:31.260]   And these mice are already doing amazing things, right?
[02:08:31.260 --> 02:08:32.980]   So when you think about then,
[02:08:32.980 --> 02:08:34.540]   what is the human brain able to do
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:36.680]   in terms of anticipating changes in nutritional state
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:39.500]   and how information that you're given
[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:42.880]   can change the expected physiologic outcomes?
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:44.260]   I mean, you're right.
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:46.320]   I mean, there's just this whole other element
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:48.320]   that it's very hard to study
[02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:49.680]   because it's happening in the brains of humans
[02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:52.200]   and we can't do these kinds of experiments.
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:53.940]   But I'm sure that's very important.
[02:08:53.940 --> 02:08:55.320]   I mean, so I talked a little bit
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:58.600]   about these flavor nutrient conditioning experiments.
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:00.720]   These are the experiments where, essentially,
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:04.680]   an animal learns to consume a certain flavor
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:06.180]   because it learns it's gonna be associated
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:07.240]   with nutrients later.
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:08.640]   Sort of the paradigm for how you learn
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:10.600]   to consume bitter vegetables because they're good for you
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:12.140]   and you get nutrients.
[02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:15.420]   So people have also done those experiments in humans.
[02:09:15.420 --> 02:09:18.240]   And that does work, but what they've discovered is
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:20.760]   it's very sensitive to what you tell the humans
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:22.960]   about the thing that they're going to consume.
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:24.440]   So if you put nutritional labels
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:26.240]   where you show the different numbers of calories,
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:28.880]   then basically they sort of adjust their expectations
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:29.700]   and nothing happens.
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:31.360]   So it really has to be that sort of,
[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:33.640]   it's very sensitive to what information you give them
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:35.080]   before the experiment happens.
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:38.600]   So I think that's an example of that kind of thing.
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:43.800]   - Without any pressure for it to be prescriptive,
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:47.280]   how do you approach eating given the knowledge
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:48.900]   that you have about food?
[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:52.140]   I like to assume that you can sit down to a meal
[02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:54.380]   and not think about your AGRP neurons too much
[02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:55.200]   or any of that.
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:57.880]   But given that you have deep knowledge in this,
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:00.340]   has it shaped kind of how you think
[02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:02.380]   about food cravings your own?
[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:03.620]   You don't have to reveal what those are,
[02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:05.180]   even if they exist.
[02:10:05.180 --> 02:10:08.760]   How you observe the eating behavior of others.
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:15.260]   And yeah, how has knowledge shaped your feeding behavior?
[02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:17.760]   - Well, I try not to think too much
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:19.920]   about my AGRP neurons when I'm eating.
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:21.320]   - I would hope, I would hope.
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:24.640]   - I think it gets, I think, you know,
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:25.880]   the circuitry is so complex
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:27.440]   and we're just beginning to see what's happening.
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:30.900]   So I wouldn't use that kind of information at this stage
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:32.980]   and we're just beginning to prescriptively.
[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:36.920]   But I think there is a set of, you know,
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:40.660]   basic recommendations from physiology and neuroscience.
[02:10:40.660 --> 02:10:41.500]   Very simple things.
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:44.700]   You've probably talked about people on your podcast before,
[02:10:44.700 --> 02:10:47.460]   for sort of shaping your diet to be healthier,
[02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:48.620]   to limit food intake.
[02:10:48.620 --> 02:10:50.780]   So one we've already talked about
[02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:52.900]   is limiting consumption of ultra processed food,
[02:10:52.900 --> 02:10:56.120]   eating more whole foods for lots of different reasons.
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:57.780]   Because they're more satiating,
[02:10:57.780 --> 02:11:00.420]   because they don't have this sort of engineered palatability
[02:11:00.420 --> 02:11:02.500]   that causes you to overeat.
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:04.300]   Another big one, which I'm sure you've talked about
[02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:06.740]   with some of your guests is protein consumption.
[02:11:06.740 --> 02:11:09.180]   Making sure you get adequate protein consumption,
[02:11:09.180 --> 02:11:11.660]   both because there's this concept of protein leveraging.
[02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:13.540]   So if you don't eat a minimum amount of protein,
[02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:15.100]   that's gonna cause you to eat more calories
[02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:17.640]   just to try to achieve that minimum amount of protein.
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:19.220]   Also just because protein's more satiating
[02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:21.020]   and also because there's this idea
[02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:22.260]   of thermic effect of food.
[02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:23.700]   And so you basically burn more calories
[02:11:23.700 --> 02:11:25.740]   metabolizing protein than sugar or fat.
[02:11:25.740 --> 02:11:29.060]   - How about consumption of fluids during meals?
[02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:32.540]   You know, I've heard it said before that, you know,
[02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:34.100]   we're not supposed to consume too many fluids
[02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:36.340]   because it's going to dilute the enzymes
[02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:37.900]   that allow us to digest our food.
[02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:40.280]   I've heard other people say that's a complete--
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:41.740]   - I think that's-- - Myth.
[02:11:41.740 --> 02:11:42.900]   - That's a myth, I think.
[02:11:42.900 --> 02:11:45.900]   I mean, I think drinking water,
[02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:48.620]   I mean, so humans don't have a perfect capacity
[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:50.020]   to determine whether they're hungry or thirsty.
[02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:51.740]   And so drinking water will ensure you're not eating
[02:11:51.740 --> 02:11:54.040]   because you're hungry, because you're thirsty.
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:58.180]   And so, and there's no idea of diluting it.
[02:11:58.180 --> 02:12:00.180]   I don't think that, and distention itself,
[02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:02.820]   even though water provides a very limited distention signal,
[02:12:02.820 --> 02:12:04.700]   the expansion of your stomach and intestines
[02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:07.020]   is one important way-- - Interesting.
[02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:09.260]   - That you terminate feeding.
[02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:12.100]   And so there is some component of that
[02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:14.100]   where you can get distention just from drinking water.
[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:15.300]   I say it's-- - Sorry, I blurted out.
[02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:16.580]   Interesting, because I didn't realize
[02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:19.640]   that fluid consumption only provides
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:21.900]   a limited signal for distention.
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:23.180]   - Well, it's not fluids, it's water.
[02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:26.460]   And so the idea is that you can fill your stomach up
[02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:29.420]   with fluids, but the rate at which fluids empty out
[02:12:29.420 --> 02:12:32.180]   of your stomach depends on their calorie content.
[02:12:32.180 --> 02:12:33.820]   So basically, if you drink water,
[02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:35.900]   it empties very rapidly into your intestine,
[02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:36.980]   and then it goes through your intestine
[02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:38.580]   and is gradually absorbed.
[02:12:38.580 --> 02:12:40.620]   If you drink something like a glass of orange juice,
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:42.180]   it will empty much more slowly.
[02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:43.900]   And if you drink something that's really high in fat,
[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:44.940]   really high in calories, it'll empty
[02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:47.180]   extremely slowly over hours.
[02:12:47.180 --> 02:12:49.020]   And that's because there's a negative feedback loop
[02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:51.220]   from the intestine that controls gastric emptying.
[02:12:51.220 --> 02:12:56.060]   So as those first nutrients leave your stomach
[02:12:56.060 --> 02:12:58.700]   and enter your intestine, that produces hormones
[02:12:58.700 --> 02:12:59.980]   that go back and then slow down
[02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:01.100]   the rate of gastric emptying.
[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:03.900]   And the purpose for this is that you don't want nutrients
[02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:05.380]   entering the intestine too fast.
[02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:06.340]   That's really unsafe.
[02:13:06.340 --> 02:13:09.220]   It feels very unpleasant and it's just,
[02:13:09.220 --> 02:13:12.060]   your intestine can only metabolize nutrients so fast.
[02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:14.340]   And so if there's calories,
[02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:15.820]   then it slows down gastric emptying a lot,
[02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:18.060]   but water just kind of goes through.
[02:13:18.060 --> 02:13:20.220]   - What a beautiful system.
[02:13:20.220 --> 02:13:22.660]   There's regulation at every point.
[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:27.660]   Hypothalamus, brainstem, gut, the rate of emptying
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:32.220]   based on the difference between water and orange juice.
[02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:34.340]   It's just awesome.
[02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:36.020]   - Yeah, and that's part of the reason I think it's so hard
[02:13:36.020 --> 02:13:37.140]   to outsmart the system, right?
[02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:40.740]   Because these neurons are making predictions
[02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:42.180]   based on the sight and smell of food,
[02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:44.020]   but then the gut is doing its own thing.
[02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:45.280]   It's calculating it separately
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:46.380]   and relaying that information.
[02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:47.740]   So at every step, there are these checks.
[02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:49.500]   Basically, they're just confirming
[02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:50.860]   that what you thought happened the first time
[02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:52.460]   is actually what's really going on.
[02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:54.540]   And so, which just makes sense
[02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:55.940]   because it's so important for survival,
[02:13:55.940 --> 02:13:56.780]   these homeostatic systems.
[02:13:56.780 --> 02:13:59.620]   They're the product of so much natural selection.
[02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:01.220]   - Which I think at least partially explains
[02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:05.380]   why thousand-fold increases in peptide hormones like GLP-1
[02:14:05.380 --> 02:14:08.680]   are required to see significant long-lasting changes
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:13.580]   in weight because the system is so strongly regulated.
[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:15.060]   - Exactly, exactly.
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:19.060]   - It's hard to beat homeostasis and hard to beat it safely,
[02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:22.840]   but it sounds like you're more or less optimistic
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:26.160]   about where that whole field of, let's call it,
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:28.940]   anti-obesity drugs is headed.
[02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:29.980]   - I'm very optimistic.
[02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:34.500]   I mean, look, I think that you couldn't have asked for more
[02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:37.500]   so far at this stage with these GLP-1 drugs.
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:42.500]   Incredible weight loss, unexpected health benefits,
[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:44.460]   really safe as far as we can tell.
[02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:45.940]   I mean, it's always possible
[02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:49.360]   that some new side effect will emerge,
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:51.180]   but these drugs are in millions of people
[02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:53.180]   and they've been in a lot of people for a long time now
[02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:55.160]   and nothing seems to have shown up.
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:57.300]   So I'm very optimistic.
[02:14:57.300 --> 02:14:58.400]   And I think even beyond that,
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:01.260]   just now that the pharmaceutical industry is reinvigorated
[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:03.500]   to investigate this question, there's so many different,
[02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:04.400]   people are gonna, in five years,
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:05.900]   people have so many different options.
[02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:07.380]   It won't just be Ozempic or Rojaro.
[02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:09.380]   There'll be five different, 10 different drugs
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:11.220]   that they can choose from
[02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:12.940]   that have slightly different side effect profiles,
[02:15:12.940 --> 02:15:14.580]   slightly different efficacy,
[02:15:14.580 --> 02:15:15.460]   perhaps used for people
[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:17.680]   with slightly different metabolic conditions.
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:19.900]   And so it'll really be a whole palette of medicines
[02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:23.340]   you can take that will adjust your physiology and hunger.
[02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:27.180]   - And it's amazing how well it squares
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:31.060]   with the understanding of the basic biology, you know?
[02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:34.260]   And that's a perfect opportunity for me
[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:38.700]   to really just say what is in my mind
[02:15:38.700 --> 02:15:40.380]   and clearly in the minds of everyone listening
[02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:43.100]   and watching, which is thank you so much
[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:45.980]   for this absolutely encyclopedic
[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:49.140]   and exceptionally clear explanation
[02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:52.820]   of feeding and thirst and salt regulation
[02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:55.860]   and these new drugs that are, you know,
[02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:58.780]   in everyone's minds and everyone's hearing about.
[02:15:58.780 --> 02:15:59.880]   I've learned so much today.
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:01.420]   I know everyone else has.
[02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:04.400]   You run a incredible laboratory.
[02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:06.380]   I've tracked your career for a very long time.
[02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:08.860]   Every paper is spectacular
[02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:10.580]   and you're in a very competitive field
[02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:13.140]   and you've contributed in enormous ways
[02:16:13.140 --> 02:16:15.500]   to our understanding of these important processes.
[02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:17.500]   And I don't just say that as a formality.
[02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:20.660]   I know that to be true given that we, you know,
[02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:22.360]   are from the same field
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:24.980]   and have known each other for a long time
[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:28.540]   and I'm familiar with your work at a deep level.
[02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:31.300]   Today has just been an absolute privilege
[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:32.660]   and a gift to learn from you.
[02:16:32.660 --> 02:16:35.560]   And I know everyone feels the same way.
[02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:36.840]   So thank you for taking time
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:38.900]   out of your busy research schedule
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:40.340]   and the other important areas of your life
[02:16:40.340 --> 02:16:41.900]   to come here and educate us all.
[02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:45.100]   I learned so much basic and practical knowledge
[02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:47.380]   and I know everyone else did as well.
[02:16:47.380 --> 02:16:48.220]   Thank you so much.
[02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:49.440]   - Thank you, this has been really fun.
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:51.060]   I'm really glad we had a chance to do this.
[02:16:51.060 --> 02:16:52.900]   We talked about some of my favorite topics,
[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:53.940]   so it's always a pleasure.
[02:16:53.940 --> 02:16:55.540]   And to talk with another neuroscientist
[02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:57.060]   about these things is fantastic.
[02:16:57.060 --> 02:16:59.140]   - All right, well, please come back again.
[02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:01.820]   Meanwhile, thanks for everything you do.
[02:17:01.820 --> 02:17:03.020]   - All right, thanks.
[02:17:03.020 --> 02:17:04.760]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion

[02:17:41.540 --> 02:17:43.220]   I do read all the comments.
[02:17:43.220 --> 02:17:44.980]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:47.780]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:50.740]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:17:50.740 --> 02:17:53.260]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:54.780]   And on all those channels,
[02:17:54.780 --> 02:17:56.660]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[02:17:56.660 --> 02:17:58.300]   some of which overlaps with the contents
[02:17:58.300 --> 02:17:59.700]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:17:59.700 --> 02:18:01.620]   but much of which is distinct from the contents
[02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:03.140]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:18:03.140 --> 02:18:06.980]   So again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:18:06.980 --> 02:18:08.220]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[02:18:08.220 --> 02:18:09.780]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:18:09.780 --> 02:18:11.460]   our Neural Network newsletter
[02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:13.620]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:15.560]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:18.300]   as well as brief one to three page PDFs
[02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:20.060]   of what we call protocols.
[02:18:20.060 --> 02:18:21.500]   Those protocols cover everything
[02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:23.420]   from learning and neuroplasticity,
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:25.700]   to dopamine regulation, to improving your sleep.
[02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:28.100]   We also have a foundational fitness protocol
[02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:29.820]   that details cardiovascular training
[02:18:29.820 --> 02:18:31.340]   and resistance training sessions,
[02:18:31.340 --> 02:18:32.420]   right down to the details.
[02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:35.260]   Again, all of that is available completely zero cost.
[02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:37.500]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:39.700]   go to the menu tab, scroll down to newsletter,
[02:18:39.700 --> 02:18:40.780]   and enter your email.
[02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:41.740]   And I should point out
[02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:44.240]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:45.540]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:18:45.540 --> 02:18:47.780]   for today's discussion with Dr. Zachary Knight.
[02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:49.780]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:18:49.780 --> 02:18:51.740]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:18:51.740 --> 02:18:54.320]   (upbeat music)
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:56.900]   (upbeat music)
