[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420]   When you think about all these lounges and the categories, the independent ones, the credit card ones, the airline ones, how do you stack rank them?
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.540]   Is it consistent that certain groupings of lounge types are better than others?
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.120]   I think on average, the airport run ones tend to be a little bit worse.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.700]   They tend to be pretty basic. They tend to be just a little room sometimes.
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.120]   Even domestically, there are some airports that run their own lounges and they're nothing special.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.520]   But if you think about it, it makes sense because airports tend to just take whatever extra space they have and say, hey, how do I generate revenue from this?
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.160]   And in those cases, you as a traveler are not the customer.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.460]   The airlines that might pay a little bit for their premium passengers to use that lounge, they're the customer.
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.920]   It's usually airports that aren't big enough where airlines will want to operate their own lounges.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.080]   Obviously, if an airport is trying to lease out space, the best way is to lease it out to an airline or even to a restaurant, things like that.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.960]   But if it's not big enough to support that, they'll just run their own really basic lounge, offer some soft drinks, and that's about it.
