[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:21.240]   Radical Personal Finance podcast live today from the country financial stage
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.040]   in downtown New Orleans, Louisiana at FinCon 2014.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:48.240]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host. Thank
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.200]   you for being here. Today's show is a little bit different. I'm looking out at a crowded
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.200]   lobby full of people. Never done this before. Gonna do some live podcasting talking about
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.640]   how should I set up a plan for personal financial education. Hope you enjoy it.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:20.360]   It's kind of interesting to be here in downtown New Orleans, Louisiana. It's kind of interesting,
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.640]   kind of weird to be looking at a crowd of faces of people looking at me. Never had the
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.200]   opportunity to do that before. But it should be a fun show. Today I'm gonna handle a question
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.600]   from a listener. I knew that I was gonna be doing a show here in front of a room full
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.640]   of people that are interested, have an above average interest in personal finance. And
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.160]   as I thought about what would be interesting, I thought of a question that I received from
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.120]   an audience member named Jeff who had sent me an email. And Jeff had emailed me a question
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.000]   and he said, "Joshua, I've been listening to your podcast ever since I found them a
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.920]   few weeks ago. Here's my question. Do you think that I should pursue earning a financial
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.760]   planning or retirement planning certificate just for the sake of learning? I have no interest
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.640]   in becoming a financial or retirement planner, but have been learning as much as I can for
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.440]   the last few years, books, podcasts, blogs, Boglehead forums, et cetera. I've learned
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.600]   a lot about investing, retirement planning, tax planning, estate planning, personal finance,
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.000]   et cetera. I guess I don't know what I don't know. What should I consider when deciding
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.440]   whether or not to earn a certification? Thanks, Jeff." And when Jeff sent me that email, I
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.600]   just started thinking about it and I thought, what an intelligent question. And it covers
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.000]   some things that I personally am a huge fan of. Because A, it's financial education. I
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.480]   guess I should say A, it's finance, and B, it's education. I know that I personally am
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.320]   not moderately obsessed with education. It also covers something that I'm probably -- I
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.360]   hate to beat my own drum, but I probably am uniquely qualified to talk about and share
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:03.960]   with people. If you're not familiar, I think I have CFP, CLU, CHFC, CASL, CAP, RHU, REBC.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.840]   So I've gone through seven courses of study for financial certifications and financial
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.860]   designations and I'm actually this next week going up to Pennsylvania to finish a master's
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.960]   degree in financial planning. So I've had the unique opportunity to kind of see both
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.560]   sides and talk about both sides of the fence to understand, you know, really what really
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.760]   works and what doesn't work. I'm also a former personal finance junkie, so I can really relate
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.060]   with what Jeff talks about and I can relate with his question. Because one of the biggest
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.680]   things that I've learned, I learned when I became a financial advisor, is that the personal
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.680]   finance world got me really far, but there was an entirely different level that I never
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.440]   would have had a peek into if I hadn't had the opportunity to study financial planning
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.080]   formally. So before I get into specifics in answer to Jeff's question, what I'd like to
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.120]   do is just start with just some conversation about education. And where I would begin is
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.880]   basically to start with why would you do anything? Why would you set out on a path of education
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.560]   or certification? The reality is, is that we really do have a limited amount of time.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.440]   And for every choice that we choose to make, there is an opportunity cost. And the opportunity
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.720]   cost is what we give up. So if you're going to spend your time studying financial planning
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.920]   education, you're going to spend your time studying, you know, CFP curriculum or CFA
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.520]   curriculum or whatever it is that you're doing, that means that that's time you're not spending
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.040]   on other things. And you've really got to, before you commit that time, before you commit
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.380]   time to reading a book, before you commit time to anything like that, you really got
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.880]   to understand why you're doing it. One of the first things, there's a great classic
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.200]   book by a guy named Mortimer Adler, who was actually the chief editor for the, not Wikipedia,
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.760]   the Encyclopedia Britannica encyclopedia for years. And he wrote a phenomenal book
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.720]   called How to Read a Book. And I'm going off the top of my head from having read the book
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.680]   probably, I don't know, 15 years ago. So correct me if I'm wrong. But basically where he started
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.960]   with is anytime you're going to read a book, start with saying, what is my actual purpose
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.680]   for reading the book? What do I want to get out of it? And that will help you to guide
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.160]   your reading. It's unlikely that if you're reading a novel that you're going to sit there
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.980]   with a highlighter in hand, with an index card and a notebook to record important points.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.320]   But if you're reading a textbook, you're probably not going to be reading it kicked back on
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.660]   your, on a pillow with your knees in the air. So the first thing I would start with in answer
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:33.280]   to your question, Jeff, is do you want an education or do you want a certification?
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:40.760]   And there's a major difference. I think of certification as being external proof for
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.360]   people who don't have knowledge in a subject matter. And here's what I mean. What's the
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.160]   point of college certification? Is it about education or is it about certification? Now,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.740]   I think it probably originally began with being about education. But in today's world,
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.940]   it's much more a form of certification. And it's basically the whole college collegiate
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:07.100]   study system that we have is a form of distributed trust. So if you are in a general studies
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.240]   degree, then if an employer says college degree required, they're basically trying to pass
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.920]   on some amount of their trust from themselves over to the college organization. And it's
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.900]   a form of distributed trust. And they're hoping that if you've been able to succeed at getting
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.740]   your college degree, that you have a certain basic level of knowledge and a certain basic
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.940]   level of commitment. So you're the kind of person that they would be likely to hire.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.700]   Or if you have a college degree, maybe in a more technical subject, so something like
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.660]   engineering, maybe you have an engineering degree. Well, in that situation, then there
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.840]   is a basic course of study. And the college degree certifies that you've completed the
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.660]   basic level of study. Another good example of a distributed trust system would be the
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.680]   credit scoring system. So if you look in the United States and most Western economies,
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.980]   we have a fairly established form of credit monitoring and credit reporting. And so what
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.780]   that actually does for people is that offers for them the opportunity to not have to know
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.700]   the debtor firsthand. And that can be a real benefit because then you don't have to only
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.540]   borrow money from people that know you. You can have a much bigger system where you can
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.760]   borrow money from a credit card company on the other side of the country or from a mortgage
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.780]   company on this side of the country. And there's this system to where basically of certification
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:29.620]   that this person is a good debtor, this person is a worthy loan. Certification is valuable.
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.700]   Even in -- so let's go into the financial world. What function do certification programs
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.420]   serve in the financial world? And there are dozens of them. And we'll come to that in
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.140]   just a moment as far as talking more. But there are dozens and dozens of credentials
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.820]   and designations and things that you could pursue. Primarily, in my opinion, certification
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:54.300]   in the financial world solves two basic problems. Number one is it solves -- it indicates a
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.660]   basic level of competence for financial people. So if you don't know somebody, if you don't
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.480]   know a financial advisor and you're sitting there talking on an initial basis trying to
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.880]   get an idea of whether or not they're going to be able to serve you in some way, then
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.580]   if they have a basic certification, then that gives you, okay, this person should be at
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:17.620]   least somewhat competent. Now, it doesn't actually -- it doesn't actually mean that
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:22.860]   the most competent people have the most designations. Oftentimes the person with the most designations
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:28.540]   just simply has a lot of test-taking ability or spent a lot of time studying. There are
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:35.140]   planners that are worlds better than me who have zero formal designations. And there are
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.020]   planners that are just amazing because they have knowledge. But you have to know them.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:45.980]   Or you have to trust a professional that refers you to them in order for you to -- in order
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:51.420]   for you to be confident that in their abilities without that external certification. The second
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:57.380]   function that certification basically provides in the financial planning world is it provides
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:02.100]   a function, a course of study. It outlines a course of study for a new person who's interested.
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.860]   And this is basically what you are -- what you are focusing on. So if you were -- if
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.300]   you told me in your e-mail, you said, Joshua, you know, I really love finance. And I really
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.740]   want to help people. I want to just do some part-time financial planning. Then in that
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:23.380]   situation I would say, yes, definitely pursue a certification. But what you described is
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.940]   not that. You described wanting education. And education is not something that you can
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.460]   buy. It's one of the biggest mistakes. And I don't want to get into talking about education
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:38.400]   today but too much. But education is not something you buy. Education is something that you basically
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:45.540]   have to do for yourself, hopefully with the help of good teachers and good materials.
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:50.460]   Education is for you. Certification is for other people. So I would say start with your
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.060]   goals. You know, frankly, if you're that interested in personal finance, if you don't want to
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.980]   practice in the area, if you're that interested in personal finance, even with your interest
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.540]   level, it's going to be far more efficient for you to simply hire somebody if you have
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.380]   a question, hire someone to do the work for you in most in-depth financial planning questions.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.780]   If you consider the amount of time and the amount of work it is to really develop the
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:17.860]   knowledge, it's far cheaper for you to pay someone 400 bucks an hour, hire a good planner
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:26.740]   and be done with it. But in order to be able to effectively hire that person and to be
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.980]   able to ask good questions, you're going to need that base of knowledge. So are you trying
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.820]   to become a knowledgeable person or are you trying to improve your situation? One of the
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.580]   problems with financial planning education is financial planning education, the formal
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:46.620]   degree program. I don't know which one to really focus on, but let's pick CFP. CFP is
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:53.500]   probably one of the more popular designations. The CFP board and the American College always
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.900]   fight with each other over who's got the better designation, whether you're going to do CFP
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.900]   or CHFC. And it's this battle that goes on. It's a stupid battle. But anyway, it is a
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.060]   battle that goes on. Let's use CFP. The problem with the CFP curriculum is none of it is tailored
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:13.740]   to you. It's much more designed to be an available course of study to help somebody basically
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.940]   help clients. You would probably be far better served to look at your situation and say,
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:26.380]   where are my skills and where is my knowledge base weak? That would be a big focus for me
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:31.860]   as I would try to start with, what am I actually trying to do? And so if you have a need that
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.020]   you're trying to fulfill, then set out an educational plan for yourself. And the problem
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:41.060]   is that we're not really trained in this way. In the schooling system, what we're trained
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:46.700]   to do is just simply to expect that education is something that happens to us while we sit
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.780]   in school. And so we don't know generally how to sit down and design a course of study
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.900]   for ourselves. Because if you've gone through the government schooling system, the course
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:01.540]   of study that you're going to follow has been outlined for you all the way through already.
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:06.460]   But I would start with simply saying, what is my desired outcome? What need am I trying
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:12.820]   to fulfill? Because then once you address that need, then you can start and you can
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:20.020]   build out a plan for yourself that's going to address that need. So I'll give you some
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:26.660]   examples. I'm pretty much sick and tired of studying financial planning stuff. Done with
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:31.540]   it, been there, done that, too much. I'm tired of it. After next week, I'm not going to read
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.060]   any financial planning books for a while. But there are some things that I'm really
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:40.220]   focusing hard on increasing my education in. So for example, right now I have a one-year-old
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.980]   son and I am really, really interested in education because I'm feeling the responsibility
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:51.260]   heavily to provide for his education. And so I've been thinking a lot about the theory,
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.460]   researching a lot about the history, about theories, about different approaches, looking
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.860]   at people who are doing it, who are looking at doing it well, looking at people who have
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:04.620]   results that I admire. And I've been reading a lot about education. But I don't -- I'm
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.620]   not going to waste the time to go out and pursue a teaching certificate. That has no
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:13.080]   value to me. I'm more interested in just a generalized knowledge and then a specific
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.700]   knowledge in the things that I'm into. Other things I'm really interested in right now,
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.260]   I'm interested in sustainable design and permaculture. I'm interested in architecture. So I've been
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.660]   reading some books on architecture. I'm really interested in communication. I've been working
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:32.680]   hard at my communication skills to really be able to enhance the podcast, to be able
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.940]   to be more clear, more direct, to be a better communicator. So I've been reading a lot on
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:42.100]   that, studying that, practicing, trying new things to learn in that. But again, that applies
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.960]   to my job. Probably the best example that I could give you is I'm interested right now
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:53.740]   in the field of law. Now, I have no desire ever to practice law. It seems to me like
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:58.780]   that is not a business that I would want to practice in. But I'm really interested in
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.720]   understanding more about it because it governs our entire lives. I'm interested in the theory.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:08.060]   What is the moral foundation for laws? What is the background? What is the theory? How
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:16.620]   does the legal system work? And so I've sketched out for myself a rudimentary kind of self-education
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:23.300]   plan, which basically is a bunch of books that I've seen, a bunch of different textbooks.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.860]   And I don't know when I'm going to get around to working through these things. I got way
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.020]   more balls in the air than I can actually handle. But working through just this long
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:36.140]   history of options all around the field of law. But it's specifically about things I'm
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:42.220]   interested in. So I'm far more interested in business law and in international law than
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.540]   I am in something very specific like medical law. I don't have any interest in medical
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.180]   law because it's not just so I'm not going to spend much time reading on things like
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:57.740]   that. But still, the skill of sitting simply sitting down and saying, what are my goals?
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.340]   What is the educational program that I'm trying to accomplish? That can be so valuable if
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:08.980]   you sit down and do that for yourself. So I'd encourage you to start there. In my opinion,
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.540]   trying to get a financial planning designation, trying to sit for the CFP exam to care for
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:20.020]   your own finance would be similar to the idea of trying to get a medical degree because
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:24.980]   you're concerned about your kid being sick. It's a very inefficient way to approach things.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.140]   It's far more efficient to simply maybe take an emergency first aid class because maybe
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.260]   there would be some life or death situation with a sick child that you would want to know
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:38.940]   how to stop the bleeding or how to do CPR. And then to supplement that with simply saying,
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:43.740]   well, I've got WebMD and I've got a smartphone and I've got a phone to call an emergency
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.300]   professional and have a nurse on the hotline than it would be to say, I'm going to sit
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.660]   down and get a medical degree. It's just very inefficient. So apply the same exact thing
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.020]   to your own situation is that if you're interested in learning, make sure you're not learning
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:16:03.140]   about some course of study that's predicated based upon preparing a financial planner who's
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.260]   going to face hundreds and hundreds of different situations. Design a course of study that
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:14.660]   actually applies to your situation. Now, I would learn from the sources of curriculum
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.980]   that you can have. And so here would be what I would caution you against. The resources
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.420]   that you mentioned, whether it's personal finance books or personal finance podcasts
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:27.180]   or personal, you know, your favorite forum online, that's great. Up to a point. But the
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:31.860]   problem is that you are oftentimes not learning from the experts. You're oftentimes learning
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:36.980]   from your peers. And that has a phenomenal, phenomenal, phenomenal value because you can
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:43.180]   follow the path of somebody else. So if you're working your way out of debt, one of the most
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:47.340]   powerful voices in your life may be somebody else who's working their way out of debt or
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:52.380]   who has some encouragement for you. But that doesn't necessarily mean that that person
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.580]   is going to be the one to instruct you on advanced estate planning. And so I would recommend
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:02.500]   to you that you learn from the programs of from the degree programs that somebody has
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:10.140]   laid out already. Now, there's a big difference between different designations. And I actually
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:15.980]   I have a beef to pick with the financial industry because there are hundreds, hundreds of various
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:22.260]   designations that you can pursue. There are so many of them. It is it's obnoxious. Now,
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:27.140]   I personally think they all should be certainly allowed to exist. I am not calling for any
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:32.980]   kind of rules or any kind of legislation that would govern that. I think let the market
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:39.620]   sort it out. But there is a huge difference between somebody who is a CFA, a chartered
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:45.580]   financial analyst, versus somebody who is I don't even know what to use. I guess I'll
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:51.580]   use a CLTC, certified in long term care planning. CLTC, that was the first designation I ever
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:57.940]   got. Two days, two days of class, really valuable on a very narrow subject. CFA, you have to
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:03.660]   commit years of your life to studying for it. So you would have to start with what degree
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:10.460]   to actually use to design your course of curriculum. I would probably take a look at the CFP degree
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:15.300]   or excuse me, the CFP designation. And I would take a look at the educational sections for
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:20.380]   it. But I would pick and choose what parts of the books I actually read. Probably the
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.220]   most helpful thing for me that I've studied has actually been the MSFS program I'm just
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.980]   finishing up. And the curriculum, if I could list out all the books, I'm not going to do
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.660]   that. But if I could list out all the books and you go buy those books, I mean, they're
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:40.620]   so, so valuable. But don't just start with the CFP. I mean, give an example. If you're
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:46.620]   going to sit for the CFP exam, you've got to know estate planning. And I pick on that
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.100]   because it's the thing that intimidates people the most. So you've got to be able to intelligently
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:56.820]   discuss the difference between a grat and a crat and a crut and a clat and a clut and
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.940]   all of this nonsense. That has zero value to you in your daily life, unless you're a
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:07.140]   multi-billionaire, in which case you're far better served to simply help somebody else
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:13.980]   and hire somebody else to do it for you. There's no reason for you to spend all the time necessary
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:19.060]   to grasp the ins and outs of it. I wouldn't even trust myself if I were planning my own
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:24.660]   estate. I would hire a team of attorneys who works in that every day, because even though
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:29.580]   I had the general knowledge, I would never do that. I would never set it up myself. And
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:35.060]   so unless you practice in something day after day after day, you cannot possibly get good
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:40.460]   enough at it for it to make a difference. Now, there are some huge benefits to following
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:46.620]   a curriculum. So one example I'll use is one of the biggest benefits would be if you followed
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.620]   a curriculum is that you would have a comprehensive survey, which is kind of what I heard in your
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.660]   question. You would have a comprehensive survey of a subject matter that you'd be able to
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:59.740]   sit down and say, "You know what? This is somebody who's an expert. They've sat down,
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:06.460]   they've designed this course of knowledge. They've laid out the six or eight or 28 different
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:11.820]   topics that they think would be of value to somebody in this situation. They have surveyed
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:18.820]   the marketplace and chosen the best books." And so you would get a very broad view of
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:24.940]   the marketplace. And that can be incredibly helpful, because then you can make sure, "Okay,
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:31.460]   I'm not missing anything there." Another huge benefit to at least reviewing the curriculum
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.380]   is I would say, "Look for the more academic books." So for example, you mentioned the
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:41.500]   Bogoheads Forum. Bogoheads Forum is an awesome forum, one of the most knowledgeable. I'm
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.420]   not registered in the forum. I don't spend much time there, but from time to time, I
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.900]   do wind up in there taking a look. And some of the most knowledgeable, well-intentioned,
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:57.900]   well-meaning people online. But you're going to get one specific point of view. And I may
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.820]   tick some people off, but it's rare that you're going to find a participant in that forum
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.820]   who's going to be able to effectively give all of the arguments against their point of
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:12.460]   view. So one of the benefits that you might look for is switch your reading from the books
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:17.460]   that have a specific agenda to some of the textbook approach, where they more... What
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:24.460]   would be the right way to say it? Where they more broadly lay out the situation, where
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:29.500]   they more accurately represent the pros and cons, without necessarily trying to lead you
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:35.340]   in an agenda. Now, I don't think that necessarily reading textbooks is the best way to do it.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:40.140]   Textbooks have their place. I have a love-hate relationship with textbooks. It seems like
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:45.260]   in many subjects to me, some of the worst inventions ever made. That there are so many
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:50.660]   other ways that would be better for people to study and to learn than through the use
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:57.140]   of a textbook. But for some subjects, especially for a technical subject, it can be incredibly
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:03.540]   valuable for you to have a textbook that is written by an expert who is laying out an
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:09.100]   entire course of study. If you want to go a little bit deeper with personal finance,
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:13.100]   I wouldn't start at Barnes & Noble. This is one of the most actionable things that I could
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:18.860]   give you. Don't start at Barnes & Noble. The problem is that when you are getting your
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:24.500]   books from a source like that, you're getting a more mainstream approach. It's going to
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:30.180]   more appeal to a mainstream audience. So you get maybe some awesome personal finance books,
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:36.140]   but it sounds like you're a little bit beyond that. I would, I'll give you two of my secrets.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:42.860]   Number one is I would check out, I particularly like John Wiley Publishers. So if you spend
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.700]   some time, if you want to get some deeper books, A, you got to get some more expensive
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:52.700]   books, and I would check out some of the publishers' websites. Sometimes you can find publishers
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:56.460]   that specialize in a certain area, and I'm sure there are other good ones. I've always
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:01.360]   just had good luck with reading off of John Wiley Publishers since I've found they published
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.100]   a few that I really hugely benefited from. The one that was my favorite was, there's
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:12.420]   a book called The Fund Industry by Teresa Hamacher and Robert Pozen, I think are the
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.100]   authors. I don't know if I'm saying their names right. But it is an amazing book. If
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:22.820]   you want to have a realistic, comprehensive view of how, A, what investment companies
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.300]   are, investment companies commonly called mutual funds, all the different ways that
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:31.860]   they can be structured, the ins and outs of them, and you want to actually know some details
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:38.120]   on mutual funds that you will never find on a blog or never find on an article, I would
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.900]   recommend that book. It's an awesome book, and you'll learn more about the fund industry
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:47.140]   than you ever dreamed existed. If there's a subject that you're interested in, if you
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.540]   go to the publishers' website, I'll give you some examples. I pulled up in preparation
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.660]   for the show, I pulled up their website, and let me read you a few titles that I found.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:58.660]   So if you're interested in bonds, here's a book, Bond Math, The Theory Behind the Formulas.
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:04.060]   It's 304 pages, and it goes through all of the details on calculating bonds. Well, that's
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.900]   the type of book, if you're interested in trading your own portfolio, that's the type
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.360]   of book that if you were working on Wall Street on a bond mutual fund, that's the book that
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:17.620]   you would be studying. Or here's another book called The Alpha Masters, and Unlocking the
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.980]   Genius of the World's Top Hedge Funds, 272 pages. These books are usually, this one's
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:27.380]   cheap, it's 20 bucks. A lot of these books are 40, 50, 100 bucks for the book. But if
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.180]   you want to actually read what you would be required to read if you were working in a
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:36.940]   mutual fund, if you were on a trade desk or something like that, that would be a good
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.940]   place to start. Another one that I would encourage you, so let's say that you are a committed
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.740]   bogel head, start with a book called Modern Portfolio Theory and Investment Analysis.
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:52.260]   This is a textbook. Now, it's going to cost you anywhere from 60 to 250 dollars, but you
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.700]   can buy it right from them, and you'll actually understand more of the background behind your
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:02.100]   investment philosophy than you've ever understood from blogs. So I would encourage you, if you
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:07.740]   want to go deeper, go there, but don't waste your time trying to become a medical doctor
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:16.620]   so that you can accurately diagnose your child's sicknesses. Another resource for you, where
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:22.820]   I usually send people, if people are interested in information, I send them to, on a specific
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:30.020]   subject, I send them to a company called NOLO, N-O-L-O, I don't remember what it stands for,
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:37.100]   but they have some of the most more consumer-friendly books that are actually really well-built for
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:44.100]   do-it-yourselfers. And so, they're a good in-between, it's a little bit more detailed
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.700]   than a Money Magazine article, but it's not quite as detailed as having to read a legal
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:54.100]   brief printed on that onion paper where it's 800 pages about Florida elder law. You can
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:58.660]   just simply read the NOLO book on retirement planning, or you can read the NOLO book on,
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:08.460]   what would be a good example, on setting up a living trust, something like that. I really
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:14.100]   wouldn't, I can't even imagine that I would spend time building out a certification. The
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:21.380]   last thing that I think you really got to focus on is what the cost is. So, certifications
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:26.020]   exist for the benefit of three people. They exist for the benefit of the person pursuing
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:31.100]   the designation and the certification, whether that's for their knowledge and for their pride.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:39.860]   They also exist for the benefit of the public to have some general idea of somebody's personal
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:46.820]   ability, and they also exist for the benefit of the organization granting the designation.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:51.020]   And the money that's involved that you have to pay simply to be certified, to sit and
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:56.180]   take the test, it's kind of like the college cartel. You have to pay the money to the college
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:00.940]   for them to certify you. It has nothing to do with how much you know. It has everything
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.300]   to do with the fact that you got to pay the fees for them to give you the certification.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.980]   You could be the most learned person in the world, and you have to pay the money. It's
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.580]   not until you get to the point of an honorary doctorate, once you're at that level, where
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.640]   they'll actually acknowledge, "Okay, this person has education. We'll just simply grant
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:20.580]   the degree and not make them pay the fee." And that does exist, obviously, in the world
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:26.020]   of the honorary doctorate. So I would just simply say save the money on the certification
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:36.900]   and spend it focusing on the areas of study that are valuable to you.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:42.540]   I would encourage you to talk to a professional, and this is one of the things -- I'll share
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:47.340]   a story with you that seems -- that to me was a good example. And this would be cheaper
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.220]   and easier -- in my opinion, this would be cheaper and easier. If you're worried just
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:57.140]   about your own situation, better for you to simply just pay a fee to an expert for a review.
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:04.460]   And that will save you hours of time and thousands of dollars, rather than trying to do all of
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.980]   your own financial planning approach. Now, there would be a difference -- let's
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.260]   say that you're focused on investing and you're saying, "I'm focusing on learning to trade
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.500]   my own portfolio." That's different than is financial planning. But your question sounds
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:20.180]   like very much generalized financial planning. Trading your portfolio and learning the skills,
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:25.140]   to be able to do that, is a very different scenario. And in that world, if you're actually
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:29.260]   actively continually pursuing that, then yes, learning deeply for your own knowledge is
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.620]   going to be incredibly valuable. But I'll give you a story. So when I was working
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:37.940]   as a financial planner, I met with a lot of people. And when you are working as a financial
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:46.060]   planner, there are a lot of -- I guess there's a lot of resistance. Because the job is largely
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:53.940]   involving sales. There's a lot of resistance from many people to talking to financial advisors.
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.460]   And you see this all the time when people say, "I'm going to go talk to the advisor
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.780]   and see what he's going to sell me." It's a fact of life.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.060]   So I was used to experiencing that. And I'm a young planner. I think I've been doing it
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:09.460]   for about two years at that point in time. And as I'm going out and kind of surveying
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.380]   the marketplace, I'm talking with people and talking with people, and I'm used to kind
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:16.020]   of having to push through a certain level of resistance in order to get people to meet
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.540]   with me and talk with me. And one day I went out to a lunch. It was in
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:23.340]   Palm Beach. There was an organization that met. I can't remember what the name of it
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:28.500]   was, so I won't butcher it. But it was one of these organizations that was organized
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.260]   where they would have a famous speaker in, somebody from the island. It happened during
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:35.220]   the season. And they would have this whole room full of business people all gathered
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.820]   together. And all of them would come together and they would have a lunch. They would have
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.540]   the speaker and a fancy dinner. And this was their social club.
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.620]   And I got invited to it. And I figured, "Ah, this would be a great networking opportunity.
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.540]   I'll meet a lot of people. Maybe I'll have some potential clients. I'll make some friends."
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:53.540]   So I went to the lunch. And I loved it because everyone in the room was about -- probably
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:59.380]   the average age in the room was about 72 plus me. And that's my kind of crowd.
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:05.340]   And as I'm there, I sit at the table with this guy. And he finds out that I'm a financial
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.780]   advisor. And he's talking with me. And he says, right out of the blue, after we get
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.780]   to know each other a little bit and kind of have some chit-chat, I don't remember, mid
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:18.420]   towards the middle or towards the end of the lunch, he asked me, he says, "Hey, listen.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:22.420]   Would you be willing to take a look at my stuff?"
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:27.700]   And I said to him, "Yeah. Yeah, of course. Absolutely." And I had to -- I think I did
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.500]   probably an okay job of hiding my absolute shock because that was the first time anybody
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:38.020]   had ever actually wanted to talk to a financial planner. But I said, "Yes, absolutely." So
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.940]   we set up a time. And he comes into the office. So he walks into the office. And when he gets
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:46.700]   into the office, he slides a sheet -- he sits down in my office and we chat for a minute.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:52.500]   He slides a sheet of paper across the table. And on the paper, it has his -- just a one-page
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:59.260]   summary. It has his balance sheet, his cash flow statement, his -- and all of his details
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.540]   and kind of listing out what his goals are, what his desired level of income is, what
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.860]   he has, where it is, how it's invested, things like that. He's got a listing of his assets.
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:12.100]   He's got a listing of his insurance policies. And then he just starts telling me, he says,
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.060]   you know, real quick, let me give you a little background on my situation. I'm a widower.
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.740]   I have -- my kids are grown. I live here. I do this. I do that. This is kind of what
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.300]   my goals are. Here's what I'm trying to lay out for the future.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.500]   And I sit and talk with him and I review just a couple of things. I look at the paper and
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:35.340]   I just kind of walk through it in my mind. I ask him some questions. And we chat for
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:40.900]   about 20 minutes. And at the end of that 20 minutes, I said to him, I said, you know,
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.660]   I think you're good. There's nothing that I can see that I would recommend that you
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:52.300]   change or update. And that was a new experience for me. Because I was so used to working with
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.940]   people who always needed something. I could always find something that was out of whack.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.420]   And here I'm in a situation where I couldn't find anything that was out of whack. Now,
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:05.540]   this guy had money. He wasn't -- he wasn't the part of the glittering rich, as Tom Stanley
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:12.320]   would say. But he certainly had money. He certainly was financially comfortable.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.700]   And he left my office. It was about a 40-minute appointment. And then he left my office. And
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:25.580]   I remember being so stunned just at his situation. At how great things were. And I was so stunned
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:33.780]   at how he had sought me out for advice. And it really revealed something to me. Because
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:38.060]   when I started working and going out and prospecting for clients and calling on people and getting
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.540]   referrals and calling people on the phone and asking them for an appointment, I was
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:47.380]   scared silly. And I had this idea that, you know, the poor people, the broke people would
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:51.100]   be the easy ones to talk to. They would be the ones who would just be desperate for my
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.940]   help. And the rich people would be the hard ones to get to. Because after all, they had
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:58.820]   all the money. They had all their advisors. Like, they had everything already all squared
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:03.040]   away and all taken care of. And it took me a few years. But I learned that it was exactly
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:12.260]   the opposite. Exactly the opposite. And the most difficult people to get an appointment
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:22.620]   with were those who most needed my help. Who most needed my advice and my encouragement
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:27.340]   and my insight. And the richest people, the people that had the most money, they were
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:34.900]   in many ways the easiest people to get together with. And yet, they were the ones who least
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:41.380]   needed my advice. And it took me a while to figure that out. And then I thought, wait
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:47.380]   a second. Maybe that's maybe there's a correlation there. Now, I don't know if it's causation
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:53.060]   or correlation. But there was at least a correlation there in my personal experience. And it really
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.540]   taught me a lesson. Because you never know where you might learn something and you never
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:03.860]   know what you might have. And I've gone on and I've seen that in other areas of life.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:10.980]   It seems to me, I can't prove it to you. But it seems to me that the people who have the
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:16.300]   most wealth, and we'll stay focused on wealth for a moment. But the people who are the most
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:22.420]   successful probably, they're the ones who are always consulting with other people. I
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:30.060]   would guess that the Fortune 500 CEO is far more likely to have a life coach and a career
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:37.820]   coach and a speaking coach than is the entry level line worker, the entry level factory
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:46.180]   worker employed in their own organization. And I personally think there's a connection
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:52.280]   there. I personally think there's a correlation that makes a difference. So, I would just
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:57.620]   encourage you consider, there is a time and a place to be knowledgeable. And that's what
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.180]   the show is about. And I think a podcast format is a really great format to get a good general
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:07.940]   knowledge, hear a little bit about things to make sure you have a deeper knowledge without
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:13.180]   hopefully getting as bored as sitting down and reading a textbook. But I would encourage
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:21.300]   you that it's probably much more useful to consider hiring somebody and consulting somebody
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:31.140]   who actually knows what they're doing. Whether that's in health, weight, productivity, speaking,
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:39.580]   business. Some of the highest performers are the ones who ask for the most help. Now, there
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:43.700]   are a bunch of ways this can be structured. And probably there will be a change as time
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:49.140]   goes on. Probably there will be an unless I mean in the world of financial advice, unless
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:53.340]   your financial advisor is constantly upgrading their skills, there's probably going to be
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:36:01.780]   a need for you to there's just a change. You know, an advisor I think can grow with a client
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:06.920]   as long as the advisor is growing. But not all advisors are appropriate for all people.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.100]   You may need a different level of advice. But the key point is seek out some of that.
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:17.660]   And that is a far more efficient use of your time than far more efficient use of your time
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:27.540]   than is trying to do it all yourself. Now, there are lots of other aspects to it. But
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.680]   you know, a financial planner's education is very different. Because what they're actually
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:37.460]   looking for is they're looking for somebody who is they need the broad-based knowledge.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.620]   Because they never know what the next situation is going to be. But if you're not going to
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:44.460]   practice, I would say don't waste your time. Don't be a masochist and don't do that to
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:50.500]   yourself. Stay much more focused and targeted on what you actually need for your life and
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:55.020]   for your success. So that would be my answer to your question. I hope that's helpful. Just
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:37:00.260]   basically in summary, make sure that you're studying things that you actually care about.
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:04.620]   Make sure that you're studying something that is actually important to you instead of just
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:11.340]   what somebody else says should be important to them. So that's my show. Totally new experience.
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:16.660]   I've never done one of these, having a live audience, having people stare at me while
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:23.940]   I do it. It's really hard to stay focused the whole way through. But hey, it's a good
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.980]   growing experience. Get pushed out of my comfort zone. Jeff, I hope that was valuable for you.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:32.020]   I'll make sure that you get this episode. Thank you for those of you who have been contacting
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:36.820]   me while I'm out of the office. Just a reminder, I'll be out of the office all this week and
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:44.540]   next week. Be back on the first Monday at the end of September. I will have a lengthy
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:48.780]   report for you at some point from FinCon. This has been awesome so far. And if any of
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:53.180]   you are listening to the show while you're here, I thank you for doing that. I really
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:56.100]   appreciate it and I look forward to talking with everybody. Have a great day.
