[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.720]   - Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.120]   This is a short bonus episode of Ask Pastor John,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.380]   and we're back tonight because just a moment ago,
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.400]   over at DesiringGod.org,
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.600]   we published a new article from John Piper.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.560]   It's a timely word and a weighty article.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.920]   And I have Pastor John on the line
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.040]   to tell us more about it.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.800]   It's titled, "Why Was Jesus Born a Jew?
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.460]   "The Devastating Mercy of His Ethnicity."
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.880]   So Pastor John, two questions for you this evening.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.120]   Number one, why did you write the article to begin with?
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.440]   And number two, what was your aim in writing it?
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.240]   - Let's take these in reverse order.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.700]   The aim of the piece is to show
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.300]   that Jesus was born a Jew to shut the mouth
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.300]   of all ethnic and racial boasting, including Jewish.
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.000]   Or to put it more positively,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.200]   the aim of the piece is to show
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.360]   that Jesus was born a Jew to bring every race
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.360]   and ethnicity to a humbled, happy dependence
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.380]   on mercy, mercy, mercy.
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.300]   Why Jesus was born a Jew is part of the wider question,
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.140]   isn't it? - Yeah.
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.740]   - The wider question.
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.740]   If God was aiming at the worship of millions of people
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.540]   from every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.980]   why in the world did he focus his saving work
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.980]   almost entirely on the Jewish people for 2,000 years?
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.340]   From Abraham to Jesus, the Christ.
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.380]   That's the key question. - Yep.
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.520]   - If we try to follow the biblical path
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.780]   to the answer to that question,
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.480]   which is what this article tries to do,
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.380]   it is extremely convoluted.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.300]   But here's Paul's summary in Romans 11, 30 to 32,
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.940]   and you'll hear how convoluted it is,
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.140]   which is what I try to untangle in this article.
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.140]   Just as you Gentiles were at one time disobedient to God,
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.420]   but have now received mercy
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.580]   because of their Jewish disobedience,
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.580]   so the Jews too have now been disobedient
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.980]   in order that by the mercy shown to you Gentiles,
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.520]   they Jews also may receive mercy.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.440]   And then this climactic, all-important sentence,
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.240]   for God has consigned all Jews and Gentiles
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   to disobedience that he may have mercy on all.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.920]   That's convoluted.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.840]   Every mouth is stopped.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.780]   The boast of every ethnic group is silenced.
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.840]   Each is made to swallow its pride.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.000]   If you step back and look at the bigger argument,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.120]   non-Jewish ethnic groups must swallow their ethnic pride
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.120]   because in order to be saved, we, I'm non-Jewish,
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.540]   we must be grafted into the Abrahamic covenant,
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.600]   Romans 11, 17.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.440]   Do you hear that?
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.800]   Neo-Nazis, do you hear that?
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   Ku Klux Klan, do you hear that?
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.380]   Every other brand of anti-Semitic evil.
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.380]   To be saved, one must become a true Jew,
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.880]   be grafted into the Abrahamic promises
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.280]   and inheritance and covenant.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.440]   And Jews too must humble themselves
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.400]   and renounce all dependence on the merit of Jewishness
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.260]   and join the Gentiles in absolute dependence
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.640]   on mercy, mercy, mercy alone.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.280]   So now you ask, why did you write this?
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.520]   I have three answers.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.560]   One, because Christmas, the incarnation,
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   Jesus born a Jew is the end of ethnocentrism.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.020]   Two, because ethnic harmony is rooted
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.920]   not just in the universal imago dei,
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.680]   but also in the universal disobedience of every ethnicity
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.500]   and in our humble heartbroken dependence
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.460]   on mercy, mercy, mercy from God.
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.460]   And third, because sometimes in the smoke of ethnic tension,
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.380]   we need to pause and lift our eyes again
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.900]   and consider some vast purposes of God
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.620]   from creation to consummation that just might,
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.620]   just might put everything on a new footing.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.720]   Jesus was born a Jew so that every race
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.900]   would exalt in mercy, not degrees of melanin.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.380]   Every ethnicity would exalt in mercy more than ethnic ways.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.160]   Every tribe would exalt in mercy more than tribal attributes.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.780]   Jesus was born a Jew to create one new,
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.860]   joyful, mercy-loving race.
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.860]   So this Christmas, may God unleash a tidal wave
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.620]   of mercy-loving peace for Jesus' sake.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.180]   - Yes, amen.
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.180]   A very timely peace as we approach Christmas,
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.940]   the birth of our Savior and the end of ethnocentrism.
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.780]   Amen.
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.540]   Pastor John, again, the article is titled
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.700]   Why Was Jesus Born a Jew?
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.500]   The Devastating Mercy of His Ethnicity.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.700]   It went live online just a moment ago at desiringgod.org.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.540]   Go check it out.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.300]   And thanks for listening to this special episode.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.080]   We'll see you again very shortly.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:09.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
