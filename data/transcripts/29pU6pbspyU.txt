[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   The Italians have their own Michelin guide.
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.960]   It's called the Gambaro Rosso, the red shrimp.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.540]   Um, and Gambaro Rosso is like the Bible for food and wine in Italy.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.040]   If you get, uh, they have a fork rating.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.460]   So if you get forks, it's a legit place, right?
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.520]   You should go up to three, I believe, or maybe it's four.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.340]   I have to double check.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.980]   But anyway, the more forks, the merrier, obviously.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.000]   Um, so check out Gambaro Rosso.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.380]   It oftentimes isn't only an Italian, so you might have to use Google
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.060]   translate to figure out what's going on.
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.440]   Um, but that's a great place to find off the beaten path restaurants.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.720]   Look in, in a big city like Rome or Milan, um, you know, any international,
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.380]   um, you know, whether it's the New York times or the guy at the Michelin
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.520]   guide, or, uh, even, you know, uh, food blogs you've read, they're all
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.840]   going to have the same general information, but when you're going
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.440]   off the beaten path, uh, Gambaro Rosso is incredible.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.960]   And actually I find the most joy in smaller Italian towns.
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.200]   And I find that if you just go a little outside of the tourist envelope, right.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.520]   You can have these incredible culinary experiences that are half the price
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.000]   sometimes of the tourist bubbles.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.720]   Um, but there's so much richer and more meaningful and
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.860]   more connected to the area.
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.400]   Lee, thank you for being here.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.080]   Round three, uh, you get to take the title as most, most visited guests.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.720]   You already had it, but now you get it again.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.640]   I feel incredibly honored.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.720]   Thank you for having me here.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.540]   Thank you for having me here in this new, uh, setup you have.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.100]   I'm looking around.
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.700]   It's really quite impressive.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.540]   Beautiful job you've done.
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.240]   I took this course, dreamstudiocourse.com that this guy, Kevin Chen created.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.000]   And you'll get a better view if you're watching this on
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.880]   YouTube than listening.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.720]   Can't really see it.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.640]   Uh, you'll get an even better view when I start to actually record in a couple
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.960]   of days with virtual thing, because that was what I optimized for, but there is
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.720]   now an in-studio option for all the hacks, which we have here.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.500]   It's very cool.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.920]   Very cool.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.360]   Thank you for inviting me in here to chat about one of my favorite
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.200]   places in the entire, entire world.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.800]   So I am excited because we started with London because I was going on a trip
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   and I wanted to figure it out.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.760]   And then we dove into Japan and now we're talking to Italy, which I'm really
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.640]   excited about because I was about to go to London.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.520]   I had been to Japan a lot and Italy is kind of like the, I went on the few
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.640]   days after our college whirlwind trip, but you know, it's a trip that we want
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.160]   to take and it's not going to happen this year, uh, but it's going to happen
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.000]   in the future and I'm really excited to dive in.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.040]   I don't know a lot.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.600]   I'm glad we have the expert here.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.680]   Well, I appreciate you inviting me, of course, and giving me this chance to chat
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.760]   about something that is truly one of my favorite places for people, for food,
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.400]   for culture, for beauty, for sites, for, I mean, we could chat for much longer
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.120]   than this podcast will go about everything that's great in Italy.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.000]   So I'm excited to dive into your questions and center some of my own passion.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.400]   So why do you keep going back?
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.840]   What is it?
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.920]   I mean, you just listed a bunch of things, but what makes
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.720]   Italy such a unique travel place?
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.960]   Well, I've been to 70 countries.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.560]   I've been very fortunate to go all seven continents around the world.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.040]   And the thing that makes me feel most at home in Italy is just that
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.320]   the Italians know how to live.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.520]   They know how to live life.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:13.000]   Great food, great food and drink, um, great food, great wine, great coffee.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.240]   But more than all of that, it's just this continual enjoyment of life.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.640]   There's the evening passeggiata where people walk, walking, by the way,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.120]   walking, like everywhere, everywhere you can go, you walk, which is incredible.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.840]   Big cities, small cities, everyone walks.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.440]   But, but they're out and about and they're walking from cafe to cafe.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.360]   They're seeing friends, they're being social.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.360]   No, one's in a hurry.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.200]   No, one's in a rush.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.880]   No, one's off to catch the next thing.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.640]   They're just there living in the moment being.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.520]   And if you look at that as sort of like a, a narrative, uh, example
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.560]   of how you can live, right.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.880]   These people have been doing this for thousands of years, 3000 years
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.920]   of civilization in Italy where they're just being, there's no greater thing
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.560]   to do or to do list or all these things that keep us busy here at home.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.080]   It's just being, and that for me is so refreshing.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.520]   So I feel like I have to go back and back and back to get another taste
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.440]   of that every, every, every chance I get.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.000]   And of course the food when I'm there, I'm tasting that too.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.320]   And it's just, it's, it's incredible.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.320]   The diversity and the ability of the Italian cuisine to take
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.440]   these wonderful things from, uh, you know, throughout their natural,
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.400]   abundant resources, the sea, the mountains, their fields, and turn them
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.920]   into these masterpieces on the table.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.960]   Wow.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.600]   Okay.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.760]   So I think one of the things I'm just going to preface everyone to consider,
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.600]   which is, you know, a lot of times people travel and they say, I got
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.840]   to go do this, this, this, this, this.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.200]   Sounds like a big attraction in Italy is learning to kind of
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.760]   relax and enjoy what you're doing.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.880]   So maybe that's a theme that we'll just kind of keep here, which is as
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.960]   much as we might talk about lots of cool things to see and do, don't
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.120]   feel like you need to spend every single moment of every single day.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.080]   That is a hundred percent.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.040]   The biggest takeaway I think people can take from this podcast is the
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.280]   discussion of, um, be here now in the moment, the place that you are in
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.360]   Italy, knowing that you're, yeah, you're not going to see all the rest of it.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.560]   Like I've been to Italy over 40 or 50 times.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.280]   I forgot the count.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.960]   And, um, what's crazy is that out of all of the 12, 20 Italian
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.000]   regions that there are, uh, I'm still missing a few of them.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.680]   Okay.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.720]   After been there, after having been there 40 times, so, you know, I, an
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.120]   Italophile, somebody who loves going to Italy, speaking Italian, eating
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.720]   Italian food, seeing Italian culture.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.560]   I still haven't seen it all.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.640]   And I will never see it all because there's such a
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.880]   diversity in that country.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.720]   60 plus million people.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.960]   You know, it's the fifth most visited country in the world.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.160]   Um, but there is still so much to see that people don't scratch, uh,
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.960]   be on the surface and see when they do their Rome, Florence, Venice trip.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.040]   And they think they've seen Italy.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.720]   You've seen three cities in Italy, come back and see everything.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.560]   Come see a lot more.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.760]   Well, I think most people listening probably won't in their
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.720]   lifetime, make 40 trips to Italy.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.320]   I hope you will.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.320]   I mean, it sounds wonderful, but let's, let's just talk high level.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.720]   Someone wants to go to it and it's impossible to see it all.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.360]   But nobody, or most people don't have 10 weeks, you know, a year
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.200]   to go spend in Italy, which I'm sure if they did, you would highly recommend.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.880]   But maybe they've got a week or two and they're like, I want to go see Italy.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.840]   I want to experience what you're talking about.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.320]   How would you suggest they start to approach it?
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.960]   Or, or what are a few different approaches?
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.000]   Great question.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.440]   So I think the first thing to realize and understand is that
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.040]   no approach is the right approach.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.960]   There are so many different ways of seeing Italy and so many different.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.640]   You look at it as like a matrix, right?
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.680]   All the different cities, all the different sites, all the
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.560]   different reasons for visiting.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.000]   Right.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.320]   And you could go just see museums and be busy for 10 days in Rome alone.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.800]   Right.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.240]   Or you could do the Rome, Venice, Florence, you know, tour, Milan tour
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.080]   of all the museums or all the churches and historical sites, and still not
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.160]   see all of the highlights that you can see in 10 days.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.960]   So I think knowing that you're going into it, leaving a lot on the table,
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.600]   leaving things to come back and visit in the future is great.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.560]   The second idea is knowing that it's really easy to burn out on too much
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.680]   eating, too much museuming, too much churching as you go to Italy.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.000]   Right.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.640]   And so building a nice mix in an itinerary is a really important thing to do.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.400]   Um, so where do I find inspiration?
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.200]   You know, there's a lot of really great media right now, um, that focuses on
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.240]   an aspect of Italian culture or life.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.040]   You know, Stanley Tucci has been doing for the past two years, his sort of
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.800]   Tor d'Italia, and he's going to all 20 regions and he's eating his way through.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.640]   And if you look at the way that he's approached his episodes, these
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.440]   hour-long sort of opus, you know, these hour-long bits of love to Lazio where
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.760]   Rome is or Campania where they grow the tomatoes that become your, your, um,
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.760]   pizza tomatoes here in the States.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.880]   You look at him really getting to know a people and a culture and a place,
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.160]   something that he's very familiar with already, but through the lens of food
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.000]   and people or food and culture.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.400]   And that's a wonderful approach for people to take is they find some
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.280]   angle that they love, whether it's in a book or TV series and they say, Hey, I
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.520]   want to go recreate an element of that on my trip.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.840]   So I want to go to the place where.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.440]   You know, Stanley Tucci finds the tomato in the field of San Marzano and says,
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.160]   okay, I found the real tomato.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.560]   Now I know what it's supposed to taste like.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.920]   Um, and that's a, that's a centerpiece for their trip.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.560]   Right.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.520]   But there are so many blogs that are out there.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.280]   There's so many travel advisors willing to help.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.480]   There's so many books you can read about everything to eat, see, and do in Italy.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.520]   Um, my biggest takeaway for people again, is take your time and know that
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.560]   you're not going to see it all.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.600]   You're not going to do it all.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.400]   And, uh, you're going to have an amazing time in the process
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.520]   of whatever you do, see, and do.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.680]   So I feel like I'm both more excited to go to Italy and I have no idea what
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.040]   I should do with a week in a trip.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.200]   So maybe give some options.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.400]   I'm thinking one to two weeks, maybe let's throw out two or three things
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.800]   that you might send someone to.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.400]   Is Rome a must include on any first trip to Italy?
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.600]   In my opinion, yes.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.000]   All roads lead to Rome for good reason, right?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.600]   Look, it's the third most visited city in all of Europe.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:13.000]   To me, it is a place that is happy and fun and lively and young and still so very
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.280]   old, full of incredible cuisine, full of some of the best historical sites in the
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:17.600]   world.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.880]   Look, to me, the fact that they could build the Pantheon, this concrete domed
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.160]   roof with an open hole in the Oculus in the center 2000 years ago, and it's still
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.720]   standing.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.000]   It's still standing.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.040]   It's like mind blowing.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.320]   Like we can build things here.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.280]   We can build a road here.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.680]   They can build a 2000 years ago, a dome that is in the center of town.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.840]   That, um, is remarkable.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.680]   And so when you see that you have this sense of awe that returns to you, whether
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.760]   you've been there 40 times or this is the first, right?
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.640]   So I think Rome is absolutely an incredible place to go and go, go see the
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.760]   sites, go see the touristy sites that are overcrowded, the Colosseum, Vatican,
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.680]   because they really are monuments to humanity and to an incredible society that
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.280]   has built and upkept these buildings for 2000 years.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.760]   But also get lost, go off the beaten path in Rome and don't just go to the fancy
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.800]   gelateria across from the Trevi Fountain.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.520]   It's beautiful.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.080]   It's great for Instagram, but go wind through the streets of Trastevere across
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.520]   the river where the Romans live and the Romans go eat and explore that little
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.480]   village and see what it's like to be in a little borgo, a little village inside
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:31.960]   of a big metropolitan city, have a meal on a piazza where maybe you're the only
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.360]   person who doesn't speak fluent Italian.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:33.960]   That's okay.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.680]   You're going to be welcomed in.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.880]   You're going to eat an incredible meal, and you're going to see the way that
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.200]   the dolce farniente, the sweetness of doing nothing passes by in front of you
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.920]   on passeggiata as people are walking from the cafe to their restaurant,
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.040]   to their home and beyond.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.200]   Okay.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.000]   That's Rome.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.560]   That's Rome.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.160]   Okay.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.840]   So let's say I want to do Rome and something else.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.600]   What are a few options?
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.760]   Well, you know, from Rome within, if you draw like a big circle, you say, I want
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.320]   to take a two-hour train ride from Rome.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.640]   You've got a ton of options, North and South.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.600]   Traditionally, people would go South to the Amalfi Coast.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.600]   It's incredible.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.440]   It's iconic.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.040]   It's beautiful.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.840]   It's been made famous since movies in the fifties, right?
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.960]   Where you're driving along these mountainside roads and there's a sheer
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:19.520]   cliff, 200, 500 feet down and beautiful beaches and incredible food and wine.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.240]   That's amazing.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:20.920]   It really is.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.720]   But Amalfi, the downside to it is that everyone wants to be there.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:29.600]   So that coast between let's say June and early September is a zoo.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.640]   What is normally a 20 minute ride in a car or a bus could be an hour and a half
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.160]   stuck in traffic on a one lane road.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.720]   That's a bummer when you're on a limited vacation time.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.160]   So what I would recommend is go to Amalfi, but maybe go in May or
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.760]   go in late September or October.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.040]   Weather's still amazing.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.720]   You can experience it and that's wonderful.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.200]   So another piece to take away from the conversation is seasonality.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.560]   You can always go to Rome.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.840]   Rome is happening year round.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.480]   It's harder to go to a beach in November, but the Amalfi Coast in
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.040]   October is still really lovely.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.440]   And you'll have a third of the crowds that are there throughout the year.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.520]   Nearby Amalfi, you've got Naples.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.200]   You've got Pompeii or Ercanuleo, which is the nearby town that's like a mini
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.120]   Pompeii that has incredible ruins that are really not visited.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.240]   You can go walk amongst 2000 year old homes that were damaged in the ash from
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.320]   Vesuvius in 79 AD and you can just walk around and there's no one around you.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.400]   Whereas in Pompeii, it can be pretty busy.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.600]   So there's little alternatives to each place along the way that
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.760]   you should try to explore.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.720]   But if you don't want to go South, you can always go North.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.360]   Florence is only an hour and 20 minute train ride from Rome.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.680]   There's trains that leave every 15 minutes.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.080]   It's an incredible town.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.760]   It's like a medieval village that still comes alive today.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.640]   And I actually studied abroad there and did culinary school there in 2003.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.880]   Wow, a little while ago.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.320]   And it was just an incredible place to be young, to be alive and to be
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.560]   living in a medieval city of today.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.200]   So great sights and sounds, amazing food.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.280]   If you like pork, that is your city.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.120]   If you like red wine, that is your region.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.880]   And there's a ton to do.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.240]   But let's say you've done Rome and you've done Florence before.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.160]   Um, what do you do on your second or third trip back to Italy?
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.240]   Um, most of your flights are going to fly either into Rome or
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.360]   into Milan in the North.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.040]   That's where most of the flights from North America tend to land.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:31.120]   So what I like to do is get off the beaten path and explore other areas that, um, are
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.040]   maybe less popular with North American tourists, but still to me, pack
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.320]   authenticity, incredible food and great experiences into a small area.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.400]   So something to consider might be Umbria, the green heart of Italy.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.760]   That's right next to Tuscany.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.160]   Um, you have 2000 year old villages there.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.680]   In fact, sometimes even older to the Etruscan age.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.920]   You've got incredible food and wine.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.400]   Uh, and you've got a third of the tourists that are in Tuscany and you're probably
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.280]   paying half to three quarters of the price as well.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.920]   So that's a wonderful place.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.200]   If you feel confident and you're okay to get off the beaten path by yourself,
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.520]   even if you don't speak Italian, you can get by in Umbria, eat, drink, and see
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.720]   well, and go see some incredible sites and sounds that are, uh, unlike
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.440]   anywhere else in the world.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:21.160]   The last plug I'll make for Umbria, by the way, in May, May 15th, every year,
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.880]   my favorite festival in the whole world takes place.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.400]   It's called the Corsa di Ceri.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.560]   What that means is the running of the candles.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.640]   You think running of the candles?
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.520]   How does that candle blows out when you run?
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.440]   None of that does that work.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:39.040]   These crazy people in this town of Gubbio, they take these huge wooden slats.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.080]   They're like 30 feet long and a bunch of husky men hold onto them.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.080]   And on top of the slats are these big, tall columns with a Saint on top.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.520]   And they run these columns of these candles through the town, through the
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.480]   medieval town and the, you know, the walls of the buildings next to you are
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.240]   like encroaching upon these candles as you run through the streets and they
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.040]   sing songs and they play trumpets and music.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.400]   And it's insane.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.920]   It's a, it's a party and no one outside of Italy goes there.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.920]   It's like, not like it's a running of the bulls or the Tomatera in Spain.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.960]   It's like this true Italian festival in the heart of Umbria.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.520]   And, um, I've only been twice.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:25.280]   I would love to go back again because it's, to me, it's the most exciting
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.920]   element of seeing people in their thing, doing their thing, living their lives,
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.600]   uh, celebrating their history and culture and having a blast doing it.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.480]   Wow.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:38.600]   Uh, you, you said a couple of times, even if you don't speak Italian, should anyone
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.920]   be nervous going to Italy if they speak no Italian?
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.720]   No, because the Italians are the kindest, nicest people.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.280]   And I say that as a overarching stereotype.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.840]   You're going to have your bad apples for sure.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:56.000]   But the people who work in trades that tourists are going to be engaging
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.960]   with restaurateurs, cafe owners, cafe workers, uh, transportation people,
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.560]   et cetera, are really excited that a big lifeblood of Italian economy
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.040]   tourism is back right during COVID.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.560]   Italy was one of the places that locked down the hardest in Europe.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.520]   And it was tough for Italians to even leave their homes.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.520]   Now that you can leave your home, the Italians are so excited to have
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.680]   work again, to have an influx of tourists again, and to see people.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.200]   You know, like in 2019, there were 65 million tourists that came to Italy.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:26.880]   Okay.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:32.480]   2022, that number was down by about a third and 2022 was the busiest year
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.360]   for tourism since COVID obviously.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.840]   So that's, that's quite a difference going from 65 million to about
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.480]   40 million in terms of tourists.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.000]   So tourism is huge for a country of 60 million that really relies on.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.480]   Um, you know, tourist dollars and tourist euros, I guess.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.800]   So getting by without Italian is totally fine.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.360]   You may end up in these off the beaten path, Phil towns,
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.680]   where they get fewer tourists.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.040]   You may end up doing the whole pointing thing, the, you know, shrugging your
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.520]   shoulders thing when you don't know a word and that's totally okay.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.640]   The Italians roll with the punches and they love that.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.680]   So I would not feel worried at all about not speaking the language.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.440]   Instead, I would maybe if you have a few hours before you go study up on
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.800]   Duolingo or brush up on, you know, learning some Italian phrases online,
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.320]   a little bit of Italian will go a long way and you'll never have to worry about,
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.320]   um, you know, feeling like you have no idea what you're saying.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.440]   Any other kind of cultural norms worth calling out?
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.160]   So people kind of fit in and don't, don't stand out like
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.680]   American tourists sometimes can.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.360]   Don't try to make a 6 PM dinner reservation.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.600]   You know, the Italians, uh, they're not the Spaniards where they're eating at
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.720]   11 o'clock at night, but, but they're not far off.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.360]   Uh, they do eat on a different schedule than North Americans typically do.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.200]   So breakfast is lighter.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:55.600]   It's a cappuccino coffee of some sort and a croissant or a piece of bread.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.480]   Uh, lunch is a big affair and it can go on sometimes for two or even three hours.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.240]   Um, but dinner, uh, will take place usually very late.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   Seven o'clock is the absolute earliest people eat in the winter.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.360]   And the summer it's even pushed to eight or sometimes nine.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.800]   So if you're walking around and you see the restaurant and it says
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.200]   they open up at 2100, don't think that it's like a nightclub.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.680]   It's actually just their standard business hours for dinner.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:24.120]   And when we were there with even young kids, um, you know, this summer we, we
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.480]   would eat at like eight 39 o'clock and we'd be finishing our meal at 10 30 or
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.880]   11, and there'd be families with kids, our kids' ages sitting down for dinner
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.120]   at 11 o'clock, which is really, really crazy.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.640]   Do people sleep in or, or like, how do they make this work?
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.160]   They do.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.880]   They sleep in and they take a pause up rounds though.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.600]   They take a big gap for lunch.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:50.240]   So if you're working in an office, let's say from about 1230 or one to about
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.480]   three o'clock, maybe a little later, you're kind of out of the office.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.960]   People are either eating a long lunch.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.880]   They're napping.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.080]   They're just not working.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.520]   They're going for that pasta Jata, whatever they're doing.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.400]   But, um, people do tend to take a gap in the middle of the day.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.160]   Okay.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.080]   And so you went with young kids.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.000]   Did you just kind of change the time schedule so that they were just
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.520]   up later and sleep in later?
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.080]   You have to.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:17.960]   And we mandated a family nap, not just kidnap, but a family nap every
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.760]   afternoon, because in the summer in particular, depending on where
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.760]   you are, it can be very hot.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.440]   So having a midday nap was a nice thing, but you know, it would be amazing.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.800]   We'd see kids out at 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock at night.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.680]   And then those same kids would be up at like, you know, nine 30 in the
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.200]   morning and I'm like, how do you do it?
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.240]   Is it easy to meet local Italians?
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:42.240]   What's the vibe like between tourists and locals when it comes to meeting
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.760]   each other, trying to make friends with locals and kind of get a true,
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.000]   authentic local experience.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   So I would say the more of an authentic and local place you're in, the more
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.520]   likely you are to meet Italians.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.440]   What I mean by that is Piazza Navona in Rome.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:00.120]   One of the most incredible piazzas that there is, it's, you know, got
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.920]   beautiful fountains in the middle and benches all around that and
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.000]   restaurants circling the entire piazza.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.960]   And it's an incredible place, but it's not built for Romans.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.400]   It's built for tourists, right?
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.320]   Romans go there, but if you wanted to meet Romans, you're going to meet them
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.280]   in the piazza around Santa Maria in Trastevere, the place I mentioned
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.080]   earlier, Trastevere, you're going to meet tourists in tourist places.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.000]   You're going to meet Europeans or Italians in particular in their
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.880]   neighborhoods and where they are.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.760]   So what I would recommend is, you know, choose the opportunities to meet with
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.200]   people and seek them out and go find them because you will find them and
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.240]   people will want to meet you.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.320]   They'll want to hear your story.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:39.800]   Where are you from?
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.480]   Why are you here?
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.880]   They're so proud to show off their neighborhood or their
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.160]   city or their country.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.480]   And so when they hear, oh, wow, you're Californian amazing.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.320]   I've always dreamed of going to California is the thing that they'll say.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.720]   And then they'll be so proud to show you their piazza.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.920]   They'll be so happy that you're there.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.800]   So find the Romans in their neighborhoods.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.720]   Find the Italians in their cities, not necessarily at the tourist trap.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.160]   And how are you getting around Italy?
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.080]   You know, are you buying into one city and renting a car?
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.240]   You mentioned the train.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.280]   I know you could probably even fly between cities.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.320]   What's the, what's the logistics there?
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.840]   The trains run pretty well.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.000]   I mean, Mussolini did that whole thing, I guess, and electrified
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.480]   and brought trains everywhere.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.280]   And there was some dilapidation after that.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.280]   And, uh, the trains nowadays don't run perfectly, but they're fairly reliable.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.720]   Um, so I would say to take a train as much as you can.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.520]   You definitely don't need to drive a car if you're going
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.640]   from city to city to city.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.240]   When you get into the country, the trains don't run.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.360]   Um, and so buses run or private car transfers are very
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.440]   simple and easy to set up.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.920]   If you're going to be staying in Tuscany or Umbria, and you're
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.840]   going to want to explore from your hotel or your villa, absolutely rent a car.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.800]   Driving in Italy is interesting.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:22:00.160]   It's easy, but it's, um, I would take caution as you drive because Italian
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.520]   drivers can be a little aggressive.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.800]   Um, nothing to be scared about or worried about.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.720]   There's no road rage.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.000]   They're just going to pass you by because you're going too slow.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.280]   That's fine.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:13.360]   Um, Italian towns tend to be very small and, uh, roadways even smaller.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.840]   So when you drive from town to town, uh, it may be hard for you to find
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.240]   parking inside town walls, just park outside and walk in it's easy.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.160]   Better than trying to navigate your rental car through medieval streets
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.400]   that were really meant for cows and sheep, not for humans, not for cars.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.600]   Um, you don't want to have that on your car insurance bill, but, um, as a
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.160]   general rule, it's easy to get around in Italy, uh, when you plan ahead and
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.240]   you know, the train schedules from city to city, uh, and then from there, if
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.960]   you need to take a taxi or a car rental beyond, so you said, plan ahead.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.800]   What do you think people need to be doing before their trip?
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.880]   And maybe you and I both like saving money.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.240]   Like, let's say you're planning a trip.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.440]   You've kind of figured out your itinerary.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.720]   What are you thinking you should do in ahead of time in any deal, any way to
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.600]   get a deal, whether it's transportation, flights, lodging, what are you thinking
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:02.920]   about?
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:09.000]   So it definitely goes to say that the places, you know, you want to go book in
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.560]   advance.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.520]   So that goes for hotels.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.760]   It's obviously a lot cheaper to book in advance for, um, most of these hotels.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.680]   You can book a nonrefundable rate with a lot of them, and then you'll save 10 to
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.320]   20%.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.000]   Um, you can also call a hotel at a time and say, Hey, listen, I see you've got a
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.160]   nonrefundable thing online.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.200]   What if I went even further and said, I don't need breakfast, right?
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.560]   Uh, they might even do a bigger deal with you for that.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.040]   And if you're interested, um, but booking ahead is very important for hotels.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:39.040]   Um, trains in particular, your trains will be allowable to book between 30 and 60
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.280]   days out in Italy, depending on the train line you're on.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.160]   And typically the cheapest rates are 30 to 60 days out.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.640]   So I'd highly recommend that.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:52.600]   Um, also recommend, uh, restaurant reservations, um, at places you must go
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:57.600]   book them in advance, but don't book every night.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.200]   Give yourself some flexibility on what spontaneously might happen, what you want
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.520]   to pop into, where you want to go, et cetera.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:09.640]   The places that you have to go, like the Pierluigi in Rome or Osteria Francescana,
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.800]   if you can get in and Modena book, those build your trip around them if you need
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.880]   to, but, um, when you're in a place, don't have every single meal booked because
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:24.440]   you may want to have that spontaneity to just, you know, eat a bunch of prosciutto
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.240]   on the side of the road.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.600]   Cause it's really good.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.160]   And it's there.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.120]   You never know.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.840]   So we talked a little bit about restaurants, broadly speaking, when
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:37.000]   someone's doing research, is there a reliable site for Italy to kind of figure
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:37.760]   out where to go?
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.480]   What's good.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.240]   Or what do you recommend?
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.520]   So.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.600]   I use a couple of sites as a travel advisor myself when I'm trying to figure
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.480]   out new and upcoming places to check out or to send people.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.000]   The first is that the Italians have their own Michelin guide.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.760]   Uh, it's called the Gambaro Rosso, the red shrimp.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.320]   Um, and Gambaro Rosso is like the Bible for food and wine in Italy.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.800]   If you get, uh, they have a fork rating.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.240]   So if you get forks, it's a legit place, right?
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.280]   You should go up to three, I believe, or maybe it's four.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.120]   I have to double check.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.760]   But anyway, the more forks, the merrier obviously.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.800]   Um, so check out Gambaro Rosso.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.160]   It oftentimes isn't only in Italian.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.840]   So you might have to use Google translate to figure out what's going on.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.040]   Um, but that's a great place to find off the beaten path.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.360]   Restaurants look in, in a big city like Rome or Milan.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.080]   Um, you know, any international, um, you know, whether it's the New York
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.600]   times or the guide, the Michelin guide, or, uh, even, you know, uh, food blogs
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.360]   you've read, they're all going to have the same general information, but when
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.240]   you're going off the beaten path, uh, Gambaro Rosso is incredible.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.760]   And actually I find the most joy in smaller Italian towns.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:49.000]   And I find that if you just go a little outside of the tourist envelope, right,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.320]   you can have these incredible culinary experiences that are half the price
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.840]   sometimes of the tourist bubbles.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.520]   Um, but there's so much richer and more meaningful and
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.760]   more connected to the area.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.000]   An example.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.760]   Um, I love the Cinque Terre.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.960]   It's one of the top spots to see in the North of Italy and the Italian
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:12.560]   Riviera in the Liguria state state that borders basically goes from almost
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.320]   Pisa all the way over to the French border.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.120]   And it's this little horseshoe on the Italian coast.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.320]   It's stunningly gorgeous.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.800]   You've got the five towns of the Cinque Terre.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.680]   You've got Genoa, you've got Portofino, these really
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.040]   iconic and incredible places.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.960]   But they're very, very, very touristy.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:33.960]   And so for me, instead of eating in Portofino and spending 15 Euro for a
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.920]   panino that I could get three Euro elsewhere, right, I'd rather go elsewhere
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.000]   and explore and see what else I could find and eat.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.120]   So a great example is a town right next to Portofino called Rapallo.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.360]   I actually have lived in Rapallo on and off a couple of times during the
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.880]   summers, because every time we have a child, we decide that we're going to go
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.240]   to Rapallo and spend our parental leave there.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.080]   It's just an incredibly magnetic place.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:04.440]   But Rapallo is a town with kind of nothing to do, but everywhere to go easily from.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.680]   And the eating there is exceptional.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.880]   There's a little prosciutto place right on the harbor called Parla Come Mangi.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.920]   Speak like you eat, that's the name of it.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.800]   And they highlight local prosciutto and salami and cheese makers from around the
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.760]   region and from actually around Northern Italy, and that's all they sell is
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.600]   prosciutto, cheese, salumi, and some sauces.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.800]   It's like this amazing delicatessen experience.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.040]   Again, you don't need to speak English going in there.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.160]   You don't need to know what you want.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.800]   You just kind of go in and say, "Hey, I like this."
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.240]   And they'll guide you through the whole experience.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:42.840]   So you could go spend 15 Euro for a panino made in Portofino.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.960]   That's just fine.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:48.080]   Or you can go spend 15 Euro and get three different tastes of
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.000]   things from Parla Come Mangi, and life is good.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.920]   You'll see it in Gambarorosso.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.840]   You'll see it on maybe some food blogs because it's now gained popularity.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.240]   But that's an incredible spot.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.800]   And the same idea, by the way, when I lived in Rapallo, we'd go down to the
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.040]   Cinque Terre for the day.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:07.000]   We'd go see the five towns, but we didn't have to be there, immersed in them and
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.640]   all of the tourist sort of onslaught that was there.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.600]   And that, to me, was a great way of seeing and experiencing the culture, but not
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.000]   having to be enveloped in it.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.200]   We could choose we wanted to see the tourist experience, but we could also
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.520]   live like Italian locals.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:30.080]   So my recommendation is if you're going to some places like Como, Cinque
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.760]   Terre, really popular tourist sites, maybe even Venice, right?
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.840]   Take a look at the nearby areas and say, does it make better sense for me to stay
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:44.120]   in those nearby areas and then maybe pop in to the tourist spot for a day or two,
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:49.720]   as opposed to basing myself in the tourist bubble and kind of only experiencing that.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.240]   And where are you staying when you're kind of leaving a city center?
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.800]   I know in a lot of countries, like there's not a hotel there.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   Are you booking Airbnbs?
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.880]   Is there a different site in Italy that it's for finding houses or apartments?
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.480]   So Italy has all ranges of accommodation.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:09.240]   The most expensive hotel in Northern Italy outside of Venice is actually in
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.040]   Portofino, it's the Belmond there.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.840]   And it's an incredible property.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.080]   But right outside of Portofino, you have Santa Margherita, you have got
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.560]   Rapallo, you've got other towns.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.200]   And in those towns, there are four and five star hotels that are not the
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.360]   Belmond, but they're lovely and they're a third or a quarter of the price.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:31.480]   For an interestingly similar level of luxury, not the same, but close.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.440]   You of course can go much down market from there and you can
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.880]   find lots of wonderful things.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.520]   The Italians are huge on camping.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.960]   They love camping in the summer.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:44.640]   So there's actually campsites within towns that have like motorhome or camper
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.400]   van style campers that you can rent sometimes.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.320]   And that's a really fun way of getting local and immersed.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.400]   Airbnb is huge there, VRBO more in the outskirts when you're getting into
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.880]   villas and homes outside of town.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.320]   So you can definitely do that.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:03.520]   But honestly, what I like to do is look around on booking.com, hotels.com, get
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.360]   a feel for some of the hotels that are selling through those channels that I
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.120]   may not recognize internationally.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.600]   And then I go right to their website and I find what are their
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.040]   specials, what are their deals.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.280]   I reach out to them through their contact form or through their booking
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.360]   form and say, "Hey, this is when we're coming.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.280]   We don't need this.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.160]   We don't need a breakfast.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:20.960]   We don't need a suite.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.080]   Barely going to be in the room.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.600]   Like, what do you got?"
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.160]   And they'll absolutely do a deal with you.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.240]   The best part about some of these Italian hotels too, is that
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.080]   they won't take a deposit.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.080]   They'll just take your credit card.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.520]   And when you get there, you pay.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.720]   So some of them have very flexible cancellation policies as
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.200]   well, if you go that route.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.480]   Or if you prepay and you make it non-refundable, you can even
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.400]   get a better deal sometimes.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.640]   And what about the kind of typical chain hotels?
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.720]   Are they worth considering?
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.720]   Are there Hyatt's, Marriott's, Hilton's kind of thing?
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.440]   All over the place.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:49.960]   All over the map.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.400]   Actually, the funniest thing I think is that the best Western
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.720]   brand here in North America, not exactly the nicest hotels.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.080]   If you go to Italy, they're actually not that bad in some places.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.000]   And surprisingly, the best Westerns in off the beaten path
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.520]   cities are actually okay.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.720]   Now, granted, not my preference always, but it's a good economical
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.600]   way of staying when maybe the competition nearby is another
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.600]   hundred euro more, but yes, if you've got Hyatt points or Marriott
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.920]   points and you want to use them in the big cities, there's
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.960]   definitely opportunities to do so.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.400]   In Italy, in particular, you should look out for small luxury
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.800]   hotels that are often part of the Hyatt sort of world of Hyatt program.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.320]   Those often times will allow for outsized value where you can use
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:39.000]   your Hyatt points to save on these boutique hotels that would
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.440]   otherwise be very, very expensive.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:45.440]   Personally, for me, when I'm in big cities, Italy has some of the
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.040]   most incredible hotels that are not parts of big brands, so it's
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.880]   really fun to experience some of those hotels, you know, there's
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.760]   one in particular, it is part of the Relais Chateau Marketing
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   Partnership, but in Rome, it's called Palazzo Manfredi and it
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.600]   is at the Colosseum.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.560]   And when I say at the Colosseum, I mean, there are suites that if
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.920]   you open up your sliding door, the Colosseum is in front of you.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.160]   There is an unobstructed view, nothing between you and the Colosseum.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.880]   That's incredible, right?
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.200]   Where else in the world do you get that?
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.400]   And so sure, you could stay at the St.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.400]   Regis, which is an incredible property in Rome, beautiful, but
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.760]   you can also stay at the Colosseum, right?
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.200]   So to me, it's like when you're in Rome, when in Rome, when you're
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.400]   in Italy, you should, you know, Il San Pietro on the Amalfi coast.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:39.400]   That family that's been running that hotel for 40 years now, they've
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:44.520]   built, by hand, every single room into a rock on the side of a
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.120]   cliff overlooking Positano.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.040]   There's nothing like that in the world.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.120]   Which hotel is this?
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.360]   Il San Pietro.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.160]   And they are incredible hoteliers.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.200]   They've mastered the art of luxury hotel experience.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.880]   Food is remarkable.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.920]   It's got a Michelin star and it's in Gambarodo.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.880]   So it's just an incredible experience, but you know, you could choose to
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:10.160]   stay at like a whatever hotel nearby, or you could stay in this icon, this
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.600]   place that is truly incredible.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.840]   There's nothing like it in the world.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:18.120]   So when I look at the big bucket list trip to Italy, I look at
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.200]   staying in some places like that.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.360]   If they're available, if they're affordable, if not, absolutely use
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.120]   your points at the St.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.400]   Regis, it's an incredible place.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.240]   But it sounds like if you're going to take three or four trips and you've
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.760]   got points for not all of them, maybe Italy's one where you're not going
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.400]   to use your points for hotels or lodging.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.120]   That's correct.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.320]   And I would prepare to find then the boutiques, the other cool places,
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:44.160]   the three, four, five-star hotels, the B&Bs, honestly, that are a good
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.000]   fit for what you want in that city.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.760]   And don't be afraid to look around and comparison shop all over the place and
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.000]   then reach out directly to the hotelier and say, "Hey, these are my dates.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:53.640]   What can we do?"
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:58.880]   And what about when you're in the city and you want to do things?
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.360]   Do you need to set up tours?
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.280]   Do you need to set up guides?
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.440]   Do you get lost on your own?
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.560]   How do you find them?
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.600]   What about booking activities, booking things?
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.480]   All of the above, right?
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.040]   So look, there are some bucket list things that you're going
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.920]   to want to see in Rome, right?
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.320]   You're going to want to go to the Vatican.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.680]   You're going to want to maybe go to the Coliseum if you're into that.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.680]   And so you're going to want to pre-book those as much as you can.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.200]   Vatican in particular, the thing I like to do is the Vatican Museum
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.480]   sells this on their website.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.960]   So you don't need to buy a special tour for it, but Breakfast at the Vatican.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.440]   It's called.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:33.200]   You actually go to the Sistine Chapel pre-opening and you're part of a very
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.640]   small group of people that can do that.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.000]   And then you will have breakfast after the fact at the
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.440]   Vatican in their cafeteria.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.680]   That's an incredible way of seeing one of the most amazing
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.040]   sites in all of the world.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.760]   It's usually very crowded throughout the day.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.920]   So getting in a little early is worth the extra dollars for Europe.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:54.240]   Now, if you wanted to completely privatize that experience too, find
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.480]   other people, we can do that, right?
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.640]   But that's a lot more money, of course, then, and a lot more consideration
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.640]   than just buying a ticket online.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:05.240]   But the dates, you know, you're going to be in Rome, especially those dates
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.840]   that may be like you just arrived the day before, and you know, you're going
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.880]   to be all jet lag the day later, like buy the early morning tickets, make
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.840]   sure that you get in to have that experience as privately as you can.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.760]   But do leave space for spontaneity and what you might find.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.600]   And do feel free to sort of throw your afternoon plans away because you're
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.120]   just into the vibe of this cafe or this piazza and you just want to sit there
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.560]   and watch for a little bit, right?
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:34.040]   So I like to have structured and very unstructured or semi-unstructured
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.920]   time in all the itineraries I put together.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.520]   Now, on a city by city basis, there's so much to do.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:45.520]   I definitely recommend looking around on various guide websites to see who
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.080]   can do what according to what style of tour or experience you want.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.640]   You know, there's a Jewish ghetto in Rome and there's a great historical
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.200]   food tour that we often combo.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.440]   And that, again, leads into then sitting at a cafe or at someone's restaurant
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:03.200]   and parlando un po', chatting a little bit for the next three hours after that tour.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.120]   Or we do a sidecar tour of a couple of these different cities where you
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.360]   actually hop in a motorcycle sidecar and drive around and get to see the
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.480]   historical sites and you never know where you might end up or where
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.560]   you might stop on that tour.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:20.640]   So some of those kinds of fun experiences pre-planned with flexibility
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.200]   in the end works really, really well.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.640]   And if you don't have plans, I always like taking free walking tours.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.520]   I feel like they're always led by young, excited people who
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.880]   want to show off their town.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.560]   They're working for tips.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.880]   So that's something you can do in any city, I imagine.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.960]   I've found them almost everywhere.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.840]   So I've said that a lot, but I think it's a great thing to do.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.360]   If you don't have anything planned, you decide you want to do something
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.160]   and you haven't booked it.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.280]   Absolutely.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.800]   And I would say, like, take inspiration from websites that actually have
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.160]   lists of tours that they offer, whether you use those tours or not
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.960]   yourself, take inspiration, right?
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.800]   Understand what they're showing you, because that's clearly a good guide
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.440]   for what you should see in that town.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.720]   And so what I like to do is go look at Context Travel.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.000]   They're, they're great tours.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.080]   We do a lot of them, a lot of work with them, or even like Airbnb
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.840]   Experiences, and just see what people are offering in that area.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:16.040]   So you know what you should focus on or not focus on while you're there.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.440]   But don't feel like you need to buy the expensive private
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.760]   tour, all of the places.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.960]   You know, in the height of summer in Rome, in Florence, in Venice, in Milan,
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.400]   it's going to be busy and there's going to be a lot of people there.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:32.200]   So maybe you do want to take a private tour somewhere, but outside of those
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:36.400]   times or those places, maybe you can be okay dealing with some crowds.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:41.880]   Um, the exceptions to those rules are places that have timed entry tickets.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:46.320]   The Academia in Florence, where you see, uh, the David or the Uffizi, where you
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.160]   see a lot of Botticelli's work and a lot of the Renaissance paintings or, um, in,
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.680]   in Milan, when you want to go see the Last Supper, right?
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.240]   Those things are very time controlled.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.080]   You need to have a ticket.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.800]   And you'll see, as you research your tours, it'll say, Hey, this
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.120]   includes a timed entry to blah, right?
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:06.960]   But what I would say is some of the best parts of Italy are just getting
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.200]   lost and wandering on your own.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.200]   And maybe you don't know what's in front of you, but that's okay.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.600]   It's beautiful nonetheless.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.560]   And you're there.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.080]   And so just be there and enjoy it.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.880]   I know we hit a lot of places, but I'm curious if there are any that we left
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.720]   off that you want to talk about.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:27.040]   So I think it's important as we record this, it's 2023 and the white Lotus is
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.760]   like the thing in the media right now.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.400]   And it's their season two, which was filmed in Sicily and it was filmed at
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:38.000]   the four seasons in Taormina, the San Domenico palace, it's beautiful, stunning
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.400]   property that they put a bunch of money into redeveloped and it's gorgeous.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.680]   Um, and it's amazing to see the impact of that show and what has happened
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:49.080]   to, um, travel desire around Sicily.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.440]   Sicily is always a constant for North Americans.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.520]   We want to go there.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.160]   We, a lot of.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:59.720]   Um, people with Italian roots came from Sicily or had family of your in Sicily.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.320]   And so, um, people want to go see their genealogy and they want to go
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.800]   see the sights and sounds of Sicily.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.120]   Um, so it's always busy, but this year it's exceptionally busy.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.560]   So I would say a book now, right?
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.680]   Um, there's a lot of interest, but B, um, know that Sicily is a place where you
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:20.200]   could easily spend two weeks and not see a fraction of it, right?
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.720]   The area around.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:25.640]   Uh, Taormina, which is where they filmed white Lotus is incredible.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.320]   You've got the Etna volcano.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.920]   You've got, um, Catania, Ragusa, um, Siracusa, all these amazing towns that
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.360]   are on the East side of Sicily, full of history and culture and art and
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.840]   food and food and food and food.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.640]   So you could just spend two weeks there bouncing around from town to
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:47.120]   town with your own car and you'd be happier than you know what to do with.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:51.080]   But I would also recommend heading a little further West in Sicily.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.560]   Uh, the town of Agrigento has some of the best.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.920]   Greek, um, temples better preserved.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.280]   In fact, in some of the boys, some of those you'd find in Greece.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.800]   Uh, and then there's Palermo, which is incredible.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:06.120]   Um, right North of Sicily, you've got the, um, Aeolian islands.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.000]   Um, and you've got these incredible, the word volcano comes from an island.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.080]   In the, uh, in that little island chain, because there's a giant volcano on it.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.440]   It's called Volcano.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.680]   So I'd go there or Stromboli or some of these amazing places in the summer that
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:24.520]   have lava and mud baths and beautiful beaches, and it's just you and the, the
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.920]   volcano, so Sicily is incredibly in demand.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:33.600]   Puglia on the heel of Italy, another place, incredibly in demand hotels,
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.880]   especially luxury hotels, popping up left and right down there.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:42.240]   And if you like the orechiette pasta, the kind of ear shaped pasta, that's its home.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.720]   If you like sausage and peppers, that's their home.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:51.240]   If you like, um, beautiful white sand beaches with no one on them for a
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.920]   kilometer, that's your home.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:57.680]   And it's an incredible place where you can go and explore, spend a week, 10 days,
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.720]   not see the same thing twice and, um, eat the best meals of your life.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:07.920]   And it's not as expensive as Tuscany or Umbria or elsewhere in the north.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.040]   So in the south, those are my winners, right?
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:15.160]   Sicily, Puglia, uh, and they make for great vacations.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.760]   Do keep in mind, if you go in the very heart of summer in July and August, it's
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:24.200]   hot, talking could be easily over a hundred degrees Fahrenheit each day.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.360]   That's, uh, it's pretty toasty down there, but it's beautiful.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:32.000]   You know, another area that I would also recommend as a side trip from
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.640]   the Amalfi coast, everyone always goes to Capri.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.720]   The island of Capri is incredible and beautiful and it's stunning.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:42.680]   So it's a sight to see, but it's also very expensive.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.760]   It's very crowded.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:50.120]   And you get the sense when you're there that there aren't really any Caprese.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.800]   That's people who live in Capri.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.560]   You don't find the locals, you find people serving tourists.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:59.840]   So my recommendation would be go to a neighboring island right across the
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.960]   Gulf called Ischia, I-S-C-H-I-A.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.840]   There you'll find true Italian.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.240]   It's a place that is volcanic in origin.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:14.080]   So you have mud baths and hot springs and crazy stuff all over the place.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:20.480]   You have, uh, people who are so happy and so proud to show you their
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.480]   island because it's less touristed.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:28.040]   And you have the ability to get around in whether it's a rental car or a Vespa or
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.640]   actually they drive these little things called Apes, little, um, called bees.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:36.560]   They're a little like farm equipment, um, like a lawnmower with a couple of seats,
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:41.800]   but they, they're stylish and, um, they drive your own, the island in those.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.480]   And you can really get to know the culture and the people and
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.280]   the restaurants, uh, that way.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.320]   And at a third of the price of Capri.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.880]   So I think we hit everything, anything in the North.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.360]   I mean, we hit, we've moved up the coast.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.640]   Let's talk about the North.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.520]   I mean, look, I could talk, as I said earlier for hours, but in the North you
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:01.840]   have Venice and the Venice is an incredible place to go for a night or two.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.520]   If you're going to stay in Venice and you've never been before, I absolutely
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.800]   recommend you stay overnight, at least one night, probably no more than two.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.520]   The reason is that there's a lot of day trippers that come in and out of Venice.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:16.080]   And you'll want to see the city at night when most of the tourists leave.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:20.520]   It's a magical place, but if you've been to Venice before and you haven't been to
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.600]   the area around Venice, and that could be anywhere from Trieste, which is all the
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:29.320]   way to the East, close to Slovenia, or even the Dolomites about an hour or two
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:33.560]   North of Venice, then you need to go back to that region and go see those places.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:39.080]   The true heart for me of the Veneto, which is the area around Venice is not
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.640]   necessarily in Venice proper, but it's the area around it.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.440]   It's the rich farmland, the Palladian villas, the beautiful mountains and the
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:51.480]   other cities, especially canal cities that make that area so rich.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.960]   So I would say, make sure you see Venice.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.160]   It's incredible, St.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.280]   Mark's Square, nothing like it in the world.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.280]   And then get out of town, go see something nearby.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.040]   OK, I feel like we hit a lot.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.560]   I think someone listening to this maybe has some inspiration for their next trip
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.840]   or they're totally overwhelmed or they're totally overwhelmed.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.480]   Maybe listen to it twice.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.720]   But one thing we didn't do a lot of, you mentioned a few places that you love.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:18.760]   Are there any other things that when you think of if you were going on a tour
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.960]   through a lot of these places that are like you got to eat here, you got to have
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:25.000]   a drink here, you got to drink, have a coffee here, are there anything like
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   standouts that maybe aren't the obvious ones that someone, you know, searching
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.240]   blogs are going to find?
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.320]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.840]   So as a general rule, as I said earlier, I love looking at Gambaroro.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.120]   So I love looking at the Michelin Guide.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:41.440]   I love to understand what doesn't need to be three or even two starred.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.320]   What's Bib Gourmand?
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.800]   What is a good place to go check out that's local and legit?
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.000]   And I start there.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.840]   And then I look at actually Trip Advisor in Italian reviews.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.680]   Again, if you don't speak Italian, take the Trip Advisor reviews in Italy from
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.720]   Italian people and Google translate them into English, right?
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:02.280]   You'll get a real sense of what something is from an Italian's perspective.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.160]   That's different from a non-Italian.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:05.880]   Let's put it that way.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.640]   So I like to read some of those to really understand what's great.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.840]   And then I go back in time.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:17.200]   I go back 20, 30 years and see what's been still standing in a spot for
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.480]   so long that I need to go to.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.000]   You know, I mentioned earlier that I used to live in Rapallo.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.200]   There's a coffee shop in Rapallo that's been around since the '70s that they
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.720]   sell a particular style of biscuit in the morning.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:37.440]   I'm not a biscuit eater, but this biscuit with their coffee is like amazing.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.040]   It's called Canepa, C-A-N-E-P-A.
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:44.040]   And so it's not like I need to go to Italy to have that.
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.560]   But when I'm there or nearby, that's the only thing I eat for the week or
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.080]   whatever it is of time that I'm in Italy.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.200]   In Rome, there's a place called Panella, P-A-N-E-L-L-A.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:58.080]   They make out of an old school coffee machine, kind of looks like a
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.440]   samovar almost, they pull espresso and then they whip it with a zabaglione,
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.440]   egg whites, excuse me, egg yolks and sugar.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.280]   And they make this cream.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:13.640]   And so you can go get an espresso with espresso zabaglione cream on top.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.040]   That is to die for, right?
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:19.480]   And I could literally, Chris, tell you 150 of these things, okay?
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.720]   But the point is, is that none of these are like undiscovered
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.920]   gems that no one's ever heard of.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.080]   They've been around for 30 years doing their 50 years, 100 years, doing
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:30.760]   their thing, selling their one item that makes them spectacular.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.880]   And so every town you go to will have this, from big or small.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.240]   And it's just a question of you seeking them out and finding
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.480]   your own that's exciting to you.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.600]   You may not like coffee.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.040]   And so those two examples I gave you were terrible, right?
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:43.520]   That's fine.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:48.360]   But you'll find the thing that makes the Italians, the locals super proud
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:51.600]   and makes everybody write about it and talk about it and eat it and drink
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.640]   it and experience it themselves.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.040]   And if you're someone like me and you're a bit of an over-optimizer
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.480]   trying to find the perfect place, is Italy the kind of place that you can
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.680]   fall into a trap of just walking down the street and picking the wrong place?
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.120]   Or is it just like, just go pick any place that looks crowded with people
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.640]   that look like they're speaking Italian and you're going to have a great.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.640]   The latter for sure, right?
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:13.960]   If you find where the Italians are, you're going to have a blast.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.360]   If you find a menu in seven languages, right?
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:22.800]   You know, beware, have your hackles up, but know that if you're going to
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:27.120]   follow the Italians and get lost, be off the beaten path, and it might be
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.440]   a little uncomfortable because you may not speak Italian and you may
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.200]   not know where you're going.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.840]   Trust your instincts.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:32.560]   Trust your nose.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.600]   You're going to find something great.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.280]   Right.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.960]   And you can get back with Google maps.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.360]   Like you can tell people, Hey, I don't know where I'm going.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:39.880]   Can you help me?
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.680]   And they will help you.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.000]   They're not going to take advantage of you.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.280]   They're not brutal people.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.600]   They're lovely, wonderful people.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:48.640]   And if you, if you start it by saying, Oh, I'm so happy that I got lost here.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.880]   How do I get back?
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.560]   They'll help you right out.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.760]   Any parting thoughts?
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.400]   I mean, we kind of hit lots of places.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:59.720]   I would say we didn't, we didn't go too deep into specific things, but I feel
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:04.160]   like you left people with a few ideas of what to try any, any other standouts or.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:07.680]   You know, um, we'll talk a little bit about airlift getting to and from
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.640]   Italy, because there's a couple of gems here you want to know about
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.520]   and a few you can avoid, right?
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:17.280]   So Alitalia, which is actually an acronym.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.280]   It's now a dead airline.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.160]   It's the old, uh, state airline that Italy used to have.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:27.600]   Uh, it died in 2019, 2020, but it was, uh, A L I T A L I A, Alitalia.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.560]   It literally means to Italy or the wings of Italy, depending on how you translate
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:36.520]   it, um, but it was the acronym for always late in takeoff and late in arrival.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.440]   It's just not nice, but they're, they're dead now.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:43.440]   And their, their, um, resurrection is called ITA airlines.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.000]   Um, it's the same thing.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.080]   I would sort of avoid them if I could.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.760]   They're just meh at best.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:55.040]   Um, the business class is fine, but economy's pretty terrible.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:01.520]   Um, but all of your us carriers, your Delta, um, United American, et cetera,
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:06.360]   they all fly nonstop from gateway hubs to Rome and some to Milan, but the best
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:10.400]   experience getting to Milan is going to be on Emirates and Emirates flies from
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:14.280]   JFK to Milan, and then that same aircraft continues on to Dubai and then it goes
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:14.560]   back.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:18.320]   So I would recommend if you can get on business class where ideally
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.320]   first on that flight, do so.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:24.720]   Emirates just recently made changes to award redemption for that particular
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:29.320]   route, which is a bummer, but sometimes on Emirates partners like Alaska and
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.400]   others, you can still find it.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.960]   So take a look at that.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:37.440]   Um, as a general rule of thumb, I would actually prefer to fly through, uh,
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.680]   let's say Paris.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:42.000]   If you're going to fly on Air France la premier, you're flying in true luxury,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.720]   then take a nonstop from North America to Italy, just that extra stop, even though
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.560]   it adds another hour or two, it's such a nicer experience than flying, you know,
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:51.480]   United Polaris.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:56.680]   Um, but there is going to be a new United Polaris flight from San Francisco to Rome
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:00.800]   nonstop coming up, starting in May, and that'll definitely help with Lyft on the
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.280]   West coast in terms of getting around inside of Italy.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.240]   None of the airlines that fly into Italy are great.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:12.760]   So don't splurge for business business class in Italy is literally just an empty
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.160]   economy seat with, uh, it's blocked off.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.280]   So, uh, it's not necessarily something I would say is worth two or three times the
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:24.080]   price, which by the way, seems to be this case with almost every European airline.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:28.400]   Um, if you're booking an international flight using points in business and you
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.720]   get the intra Europe flight in business for free, why not?
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.080]   Sure.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.360]   But it was, but you will be wildly underwhelmed if you've never had that
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.320]   experience because it's literally just a blocked seat in between you.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:39.880]   Exactly.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.400]   And in fact, if you're traveling with someone, depending on the airline,
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.120]   sometime that that seat is actually blocked.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.600]   Like you can't actually lift up the armrest.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.240]   There's a thing there.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.160]   So, so, uh, if you actually want to sit next to whoever you're traveling with,
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.920]   you actually can't in those seats.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.200]   So, uh, I totally agree there.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.920]   Any other, uh, points, miles tricks.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:04.520]   Normally I would, I would do a location episode and do it separately because most
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:08.400]   of the people I talked to about countries aren't as dialed in on points and miles,
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.120]   whereas you might be, um, anything there.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:15.920]   So, I mean, definitely on the, on the hotel side, um, take a look at using
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:20.920]   Hyatt points for properties in big cities, especially through the SLH properties.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.440]   Take a look at using Hilton points.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:26.720]   There's a few higher end Hilton's that are sometimes not that egregious.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.640]   Usually they're pretty bad.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:32.000]   Um, and then there are a handful of Marriott properties, uh, especially
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.960]   those on Sardinia that are usually exceptionally expensive, but
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.600]   sometimes allow points redemptions.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:41.720]   So usually it's shoulder season, like end of May or early September.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.800]   But if you can get one of those Sardinian properties, it's normally
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:48.200]   2000 Euro a night and it's 60,000 Marriott points.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.320]   Jump on that twice.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:53.560]   And then some right on the airline side.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:58.960]   Uh, I do like to fly through, uh, Northern continental Europe, uh, Germany,
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:04.320]   Switzerland, France, even sometimes the UK, uh, when doing points redemptions,
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:09.000]   because I find that the, the value of the ticket that I'm usually redeeming
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:15.120]   for would be greater than, um, the price that I would pay for either a nonstop
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:19.280]   flight from the States, um, or, uh, I can, I can get a better experience,
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.440]   better bang for my buck.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.120]   Cool.
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:21.920]   All right.
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.520]   Well, Lee, I feel like I'm ready both for lunch, by the way.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:30.360]   Now I'm both hungry, but I'm also excited for a trip to Italy.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.280]   I don't know when it'll happen because two kids traveling, you know, we're
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:38.520]   still recovering from the trip to London and Paris, but I'm excited whenever it
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.000]   happens, just want to call out Chris.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.240]   I have done weekend trips with kids to Italy before.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.560]   It's not an insane idea.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.320]   You can do it yourselves, choose one city and go and spend three nights.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.240]   I, I don't think that sounds as fun as you make it seem.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.200]   It sounds like your kids are older than ours.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:58.440]   Uh, I don't know if a weekend trip with a seven month old is going to be fun.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.280]   Not really, not really too exciting when they're that little.
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:01.840]   Cool.
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.040]   Well, thank you for doing this.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:03.440]   Thank you.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.040]   I appreciate the opportunity and, uh, dai, andiamo in Italia.
