[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.840]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.640]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.560]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.080]   My guest today is Dr. Richard Schwartz.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.640]   Dr. Richard Schwartz is the founder
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.000]   of Internal Family Systems Therapy,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.860]   which is a unique form of therapy
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.660]   that's less centered on your relationship to other people,
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.880]   but instead focuses mainly on identifying
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.120]   the parts of yourself and your personality
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.280]   that tend to emerge in different situations,
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.440]   and that tend to create anxiety, resent, or depression.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.480]   Another key feature of Internal Family Systems Therapy
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.760]   is that it's not just focused
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.640]   on fixing challenges within us,
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.060]   it also teaches you how to grow your confidence,
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.640]   openness, and compassion.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.960]   Now, today's episode is different
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.840]   than any other episode of the podcast
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.620]   that we've done before, and that's for two reasons.
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.440]   First, Dr. Schwartz takes me through
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.440]   a brief session of IFS therapy,
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.120]   so you can see exactly what it looks like in practice,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.340]   and then he takes you, the listener, through it as well.
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.560]   So as you'll soon observe and experience,
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.240]   Internal Family Systems Therapy
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.760]   allows you to work through challenging sticking points,
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.480]   basically the parts or feelings within you
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.760]   that you don't like to have,
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.200]   and then it shows you how to convert those feelings
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.320]   into more functional aspects of yourself.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.480]   So as you'll soon see,
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.480]   Internal Family Systems Therapy is both super interesting
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.180]   and it's an incredibly empowering practice.
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.800]   It's also a form of therapy that's now been studied
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.780]   and for which there's a lot of peer-reviewed science
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.140]   to support its efficacy.
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.800]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.560]   Dr. Dick Schwartz will have shown you
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.200]   that a lot of the negative reactions
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.720]   that we tend to have with different people and things
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.080]   tend to originate from a few basic patterns
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.560]   that once we understand,
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.720]   we can really transmute into more positive responses.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.480]   It's a really interesting practice.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.840]   It's one that you can apply today during the episode
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.480]   and that you can return to
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.040]   in order to apply going forward in your life.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.960]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.940]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.520]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.680]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.680]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.440]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.800]   to the general public.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.080]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.400]   this episode does include sponsors.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.160]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Richard Schwartz.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.340]   Dr. Dick Schwartz, welcome.
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.600]   - Thank you, Andrew.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.240]   It's delightful to be with you.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.080]   - Yeah, I've heard so much about you and your work
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.580]   and internal family systems models.
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.280]   I've had the opportunity to do a little bit of that work.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.480]   To be honest, I don't know whether or not
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.900]   the person I did that work with was formally trained in it.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.640]   So I'd like to start off by just asking you,
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.420]   what is internal family systems
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.200]   and what are the different components?
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.480]   And as we do that, I'm sure people are going to be thinking
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.700]   about these various components for their own life
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.120]   and the people in their lives.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.900]   - Great. - Yeah.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.300]   Well, originally I developed it as a form of psychotherapy,
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.760]   which is probably the way it's used most now,
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.120]   but it's also become a kind of life practice
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.800]   and just a paradigm for understanding the human mind
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.000]   and as an alternative to the culture's paradigm.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.760]   So that's saying a lot
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.460]   and it's been quite a journey.
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.000]   - I know of Freudian psychoanalysis.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.920]   I know of any number of different branches of psychology
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.800]   that have a clinical slant to them.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.640]   There's cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.580]   What are the core components of internal family systems?
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.400]   - Yeah, so one basic assumption
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.300]   is that the mind isn't unitary,
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.220]   that actually we're all multiple personalities,
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.200]   not in the diagnostic sense,
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.400]   but we all have these, what I call parts,
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   other systems call sub-personalities,
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.140]   ego states, things like that,
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.440]   and that it's the natural state of the mind to be that way,
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.240]   that we're born with them because they're all very valuable
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.480]   and have qualities and resources
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.620]   to help us survive and thrive,
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.560]   but trauma and what's called attachment injuries
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.920]   and the slings and arrows we suffer
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.560]   force these little naturally valuable parts
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.200]   into roles that can be destructive.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.000]   Often they don't like it all,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.320]   but because they're frozen often in time
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.560]   during the trauma and they live as if it's still happening,
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.600]   they're in these protective roles
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.200]   that can be quite extreme and interfere in your life.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.080]   And, yeah, so I just stumbled onto the phenomena
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.560]   40, now I think it's 41 years ago,
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.520]   and it's been an amazing ride.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.360]   - So at the time,
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.500]   were you already practicing as a clinical psychologist?
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.880]   - Actually, I have a PhD in marital and family therapy,
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.520]   so I was part of the movement in family therapy
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.640]   away from intrapsychic work.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.640]   There was a polarization and we thought
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.160]   we could reorganize families
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.120]   and heal all these symptoms just by doing that.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.760]   We didn't have to muck around in the inner world.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.200]   And I went to prove that, and this was about 1983,
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.320]   by getting a group of bulimic kids together
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   and their families and tried to reorganize the families
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.840]   just the way the book said to and failed.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.720]   Kids didn't realize they'd been cured
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.320]   and they kept binging and purging.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.160]   So out of frustration, I began asking why,
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.600]   and they started talking this language of parts,
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   and they would say some version of,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.440]   when something bad happens in my life,
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.960]   it triggers this critic
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.040]   who's calling me all kinds of names inside,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.740]   and that goes right to the heart of a part
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.400]   that feels empty and alone and worthless.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.000]   And that's so distressing to feel
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   that the binge part comes in and takes me out,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.440]   takes me away from all that pain.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.760]   But the critic comes in and attacks me for the binge,
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.560]   and then the criticism goes right to the heart
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.320]   of that worthless part.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.120]   So to me, as a family therapist,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.400]   this sounded like what I'd been studying
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.040]   in external families,
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.760]   these circular sequences of interaction.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.080]   And so I just got curious and just started to explore.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.760]   - Are these different parts that exist
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.280]   within each and all of us,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.600]   are they represented by a clear and distinct voice
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.400]   from the other, or do people typically experience them
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.420]   as just the self, like my inner critic?
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.080]   You'll give us the other names and titles.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.240]   Or is this happening typically
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.840]   below people's conscious awareness?
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.680]   - Some of both.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.080]   So most people are aware they're a critic,
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.560]   but other times you're not aware of these parts
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.400]   we call exiles that you've locked away
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.600]   because you didn't want to feel their feelings.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.840]   They're stuck in these bad trauma scenes.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.040]   And to survive in your life, you had to push them away.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.360]   And so with those parts,
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.040]   a lot of people aren't really consciously aware of them
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.280]   until these protected parts give space
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.620]   and open the door to the exiles.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.860]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.080]   and acknowledge our sponsor, BetterHelp.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.840]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.520]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.360]   Now, I personally have been doing therapy weekly
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.880]   for well over 30 years.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.720]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.000]   just as important as getting regular exercise,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.840]   which of course I also do every week.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.000]   There are essentially three things
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.180]   that great therapy provides.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.820]   First of all, it provides a good rapport with somebody
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.360]   that you can trust and talk to
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.040]   about pretty much any issue with.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.080]   Second of all, it can provide support
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.160]   in the form of emotional support and directed guidance.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.200]   And third, expert therapy can provide useful insights,
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.680]   insights that allow you to better
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.300]   not just your emotional life and your relationship life,
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.640]   but of course, also the relationship to yourself
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.440]   and your professional life and to all sorts of goals.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.020]   BetterHelp makes it very easy to find an expert therapist
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.240]   with whom you resonate with
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.220]   and that can provide you those three benefits
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.820]   that come from effective therapy.
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.680]   Also, because BetterHelp allows for therapy
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.580]   to be done entirely online,
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.720]   it's super time efficient
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.560]   and easy to fit into a busy schedule.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.880]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.860]   you can go to betterhelp.com/huberman

[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.680]   Today's episode is also brought to us by David.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.960]   David makes a protein bar unlike any other.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.680]   It has 28 grams of protein,
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.040]   only 150 calories and zero grams of sugar.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.180]   That's right, 28 grams of protein
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.880]   and 75% of its calories come from protein.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.800]   This is 50% higher than the next closest protein bar.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.160]   David protein bars also taste amazing.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.880]   Even the texture is amazing.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.000]   My favorite bar is the chocolate chip cookie dough,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   but then again, I also like
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.880]   the new chocolate peanut butter flavor
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.240]   and the chocolate brownie flavor.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.560]   Basically, I like all the flavors a lot.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.760]   They're all incredibly delicious.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.160]   In fact, the toughest challenge
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.320]   is knowing which ones to eat on which days
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.840]   and how many times per day.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.200]   I limit myself to two per day,
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.800]   but I absolutely love them.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.040]   With David, I'm able to get 28 grams of protein
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.560]   in the calories of a snack,
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.320]   which makes it easy to hit my protein goals
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.360]   of one gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.020]   And it allows me to do so
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.240]   without ingesting too many calories.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.280]   I'll eat a David protein bar most afternoons as a snack.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.400]   And I always keep one with me
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.400]   when I'm out of the house or traveling.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.640]   They're incredibly delicious.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.280]   And given that they have 28 grams of protein,
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.500]   they're really satisfying for having just 150 calories.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.720]   If you'd like to try David,
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.800]   you can go to davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.080]   Again, that's davidprotein.com/huberman.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.800]   - I definitely want to go into
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.720]   what the various protector roles or titles are,
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.840]   labels, excuse me, and the exiles.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.360]   Before we do that,
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.560]   since you brought up the topic of trauma,
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.040]   this is a topic that I think
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.520]   many, many people are interested in.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.460]   I'm just curious, how do you define a trauma?
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:09.960]   And why do you think it is that traumas tend to lock us
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.960]   into a state that was representative of an earlier time?
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.600]   Why is it that it's so linked
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.760]   to this thing of time perception?
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.640]   - Yeah, the why question I can't totally answer,
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.160]   but it definitely is.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.080]   And for me, traumas aren't necessarily traumatizing.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.540]   So something bad happens to you,
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.720]   and if you can access what you and Martha Beck
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.160]   were calling the self, to capitalize,
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.520]   and you go to the part of you
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.940]   that got hurt by what happened,
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.240]   instead of pushing it away and locking it up,
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.440]   and you embrace it and you bring it closer to you,
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.760]   which means going to your suffering,
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.640]   which is counter to what most of us try to do.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.960]   But if you were to do that,
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.120]   and you could help it unload the feelings
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.160]   it got from the trauma,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.980]   then you're not traumatized.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.920]   What's traumatizing is something bad happens,
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.120]   these more vulnerable parts of us,
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.440]   the most sensitive parts of us,
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.080]   get hurt or feel worthless because of what happened,
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.480]   or get terrified, and then we lock 'em away
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.600]   because we don't wanna feel that feeling anymore,
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.880]   and everybody around us tells us to just let it go,
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.480]   just move on, don't look back.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.860]   And so we wind up exiling our most sensitive parts
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.540]   simply because they got hurt.
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.360]   And then when you have a lot of exiles,
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.840]   you feel more delicate, the world seems more dangerous,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.320]   'cause anything could trigger that.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.880]   And when they get triggered, they'll blow up,
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.440]   they'll take over.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.040]   So it's like these flames of raw emotion come popping out.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.240]   So other parts are forced into these manager roles
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.340]   or these protective roles.
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.300]   And some of them are trying to manage your life
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.960]   so that you don't get triggered anymore,
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.960]   so that, for example, nobody gets close enough to you
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.200]   to trigger any of that,
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.600]   or so you look really good, so you don't get rejected,
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.800]   or perform at a really high level
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.120]   to counter the worthlessness.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.920]   Many of those become the critics,
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.120]   because in their effort to try to get you to look good,
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.920]   they're yelling at you to try and behave
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.560]   and do what they want so you look better.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.680]   And then there are other, what we call manager protectors,
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.680]   that are, for some people, particularly women,
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.040]   have these massive caretaking parts
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.760]   that don't let them take care of themselves
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.800]   and take care of everybody else.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.680]   So I could go on and on.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.520]   There's a lot of common manager roles.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.840]   And I want to make clear as I'm talking about this
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.720]   that these are not the essence of the parts,
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.920]   and that's a big mistake that most of the field has made,
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.520]   is to assume the critic is just
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.560]   an internalized, critical, apparent voice
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.880]   instead of listening to it and hearing
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.000]   that it's desperately trying to protect you.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.820]   So none of these are what they seem.
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.800]   It's the role they've been forced into.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.760]   And the analogy, again, is to an external family,
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.360]   like kids in dysfunctional families
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.120]   are forced into these extreme roles
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.280]   that aren't who they are.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.680]   It's the role they got forced into
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.920]   by the dynamics of the family.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.220]   So the same is true with this internal family.
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:34.960]   So most of us have a lot of what we call managers.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.240]   They got us here, they help us in our careers,
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.420]   and they, other systems would call them
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.920]   the defenses or the ego.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:48.460]   And, you know, in spirituality, they get vilified too.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:54.380]   But their whole MO is keep everything under control,
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.940]   please everybody, and you'll survive.
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.260]   The world has a way of breaking through those defenses,
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.280]   triggering an exile.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.540]   When that happens, it's a big emergency.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.020]   'Cause again, these flames of raw emotion
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.500]   are gonna overwhelm you and make you
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.980]   have trouble functioning or even getting out of bed.
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.860]   So there are other parts that immediately go into action
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.380]   to deal with that emergency.
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.340]   And in contrast to these managers,
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.380]   they're impulsive, reactive, damn the torpedoes.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.740]   I don't care about the collateral damage to your body,
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.460]   to your relationships.
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.580]   I just got to get you higher than those flames
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.820]   or douse them with some substance
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.100]   or distract you till they burn themselves out.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.680]   So we call those firefighters.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.980]   And again, these are just the roles.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.180]   When released from these roles,
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.640]   they'll transform into being something very valuable.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:54.580]   - So the firefighter, the inner firefighter role
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.100]   is one of the exiles that surfaces
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.140]   under conditions of a lot of emotion.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.140]   Maybe we could, this is a beautiful description
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.380]   and I'm completely on board this idea
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.980]   that we have multiple aspects of self or selves inside.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.600]   Jung said that too, I think, right?
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.300]   - Yeah, Jung had all this a long time ago.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:18.300]   - Yeah, and what I like about this protectors/managers
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.380]   versus, again, not versus because they're combated,
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.100]   but as a distinct category, the exiles is,
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.840]   just feels very true to me.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.300]   And I like the directness of the language.
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:36.300]   So maybe we could just like create a mental grid for people.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.460]   Like if, let's say I came to you as a patient
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.460]   and I said, listen, I'll just be direct.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.300]   I'll be honest.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.120]   Why not do it?
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.580]   - Let's do it. - Let's do it.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.820]   Secretly, I brought you here to get therapy.
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.260]   No, but okay.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.900]   So I'm somebody who for a very long time
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.800]   has been able to organize his life.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:00.080]   I tend to have smooth interactions with my coworkers,
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.100]   great friendships.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.060]   I now have a very good relationship
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.860]   with my immediate family, very good in fact.
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.960]   I'm still working on a few things with a few people,
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.340]   but I'm living in a mode of great joy
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.260]   and appreciation these days.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.580]   However, I'm not gonna give the details of this
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.180]   for sake of privacy, but the other day I was in a discussion
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.100]   with a family member and they had a grievance with me
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.740]   that I felt we had already addressed
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.840]   and it became a very high friction conversation
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.920]   very quickly to the point where we tabled as an idea
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.060]   that maybe we just take some serious space,
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:43.320]   which was not reflective of how deeply I love this person
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.160]   or they love me.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.320]   It was just a feeling of both of us
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.480]   just being in this high tension place like, ugh.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.480]   And fortunately, the conversation ended well
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.920]   with a path forward that involved more contact, not less,
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.660]   that both of us feel really good about.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.960]   But in that moment where I'm feeling overwhelmed
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:10.120]   and they're feeling overwhelmed, what's going on there?
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.580]   We're both adults.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.660]   - So overwhelmed with anger at each other or--
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.660]   - Frustration. - Frustration, yeah.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.460]   - Frustration, like that previous conversations
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:24.460]   I felt I hadn't, I was saying things,
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:29.400]   they were saying things, but I feel like there was
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.120]   so much underlying tension based on a history
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:37.120]   of poor communication nested on top of a,
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.400]   of the kind of an intensity of emotion
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.760]   that we both tend to carry.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.800]   And somehow we just like couldn't parse things
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.320]   from that state.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.620]   And so I sat in my chair and I just told myself,
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.860]   okay, I'm gonna not say anything for five minutes
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.500]   because I know myself.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.940]   It's not that I thought I would say something
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.300]   really barbed wire, but I just thought,
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.340]   this is not gonna work.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.520]   Like I'm slamming my head against a wall.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.880]   They're not hearing me.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.020]   I'm clearly not hearing them.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.340]   And the thing that helped me through that was just,
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.320]   'cause it was what was taught to me,
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.200]   I just decided to surrender.
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.160]   And the word surrender used to mean to me,
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.040]   letting go of truth.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.620]   And it felt really scary because when you say surrender,
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.080]   it's almost like saying one context is surrender means
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.720]   you're right no matter, and you're right.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.760]   - I was just gonna say, that's right.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.880]   - But I've come to realize that surrender to me
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.620]   is just a surrender in the moment
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.480]   so that I can get better optics,
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.420]   internal and external optics.
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.600]   So to me, the thing of embracing surrender
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.200]   in those types of moments, very uncomfortable.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:53.240]   But I now have learned it's a great way to get perspective.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:59.280]   But even as I describe it, the whole situation was so heavy.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.160]   I came out of that call, even though it ended well
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.000]   and was like, ugh.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   - Yeah. - Like, ugh.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.460]   That was like, I'd never run a marathon,
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.240]   but I'd rather run a marathon than do two of those a week.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.080]   - Totally agree.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.880]   - Yeah, I had one of those with my wife a few days ago.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.880]   - Okay, all right, well.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.240]   - And yeah, very similar.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.600]   Just caught that part and said,
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.840]   okay, let's just let it go for now and we'll talk later.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.900]   So I could give you my take on what happened,
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.200]   but if you wanted to,
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.120]   we could just go in and do a little exploring.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.320]   - Sure. - Yeah?
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.760]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.660]   - Okay, should we start with the frustrated, angry part?
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.500]   - Sure.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.660]   - All right, you ready?
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.380]   - I believe so, yeah.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.300]   - Okay. (laughing)
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.660]   So remember that feeling,
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.020]   and then focus on it and find it in your body
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.140]   or around your body.
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:58.940]   Okay, where do you find it?
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.740]   - Somewhere between the middle of my midsection
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.540]   and up, like, right behind my forehead.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.980]   Like, there's pressure.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.180]   - It's great in both places.
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.680]   It's great you have such clarity about it.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.180]   So as you focus there,
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.800]   how do you feel toward this part of you?
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.180]   - Oh, no, it's very unpleasant.
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.380]   - So you don't like it?
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.600]   - No, I don't like it.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.100]   - Yeah, which makes sense,
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.460]   'cause it does sometimes escalate things with your friend
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.660]   and doesn't leave you feeling good.
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:36.100]   So I understand why you don't like it,
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.460]   but we're gonna ask the parts that don't like it
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.740]   to give us the space to just get curious about it
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.900]   and see if that's possible.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.740]   - Okay.
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.340]   Okay.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.000]   - So how do you feel toward it now?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.440]   - A little bit of relaxation in the head part of it.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:02.140]   Yeah, it's funny how when you asked me to localize it,
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:02.980]   it's so clear.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.020]   It's like this thing inside me.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.040]   It's like this about the size of like a teddy bear
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:06.880]   that's just like, oh,
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.520]   but it's not a good thing.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.880]   It's like pushed up there.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.940]   But then when you said to get curious about it,
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.740]   it feels like it kind of drops down a little bit
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.240]   and kind of moves in a little,
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.520]   maybe softens a little bit.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.280]   - So you do feel curious toward it?
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.140]   - Yeah.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.340]   - All right, so go ahead and ask it
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.560]   what it wants you to know about itself.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.680]   - Silently.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   - Up to you, either way, whichever is more comfortable.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.440]   - Well, since this is a podcast
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.380]   and none of this is comfortable anyway
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.100]   for me to do in public, if I'm quite honest.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:37.940]   - Yeah, just ask inside.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:38.780]   - Sure.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.300]   No, I'll do it out loud.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:45.720]   Okay, so what do you want me to know about you?
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.660]   - Yeah, and just wait for the answer.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.500]   Don't think.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.120]   I know you've got a big cognitive part,
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.820]   so we're gonna ask that one to relax.
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.060]   And just whatever comes in terms of the answer,
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.020]   just wait for it.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:02.020]   - Well, my answer is based on the feeling
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.300]   that occurred immediately after asking it,
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.300]   which was, the answer was, I can dissipate.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.220]   And then I kind of felt it dissipate.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.060]   - Okay.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.020]   - So it feels like an energy that when condensed, sucks.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.300]   But when I look at it, softened a little bit,
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.140]   and then asked the question you asked,
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.740]   and then it feels like it just kind of
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:24.940]   went into the rest of my body,
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.940]   but not poisoning the rest of my body,
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.500]   just kind of mixing in with,
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.420]   you know, of course we're speaking in completely,
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.700]   you know, in mystical terms here, but.
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.900]   - So it relaxed.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.220]   It may not have dissipated in the way we think about that.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.040]   It might've just relaxed more.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.620]   But just keep asking it, what's it afraid would happen
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.900]   if in that context, it didn't try to take over
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.900]   in the way that it did?
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.540]   Just ask that question.
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.860]   - That if it didn't try to take over?
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.260]   - Yeah, what's it afraid would happen
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.300]   if it hadn't tried to take over?
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.140]   - Oh.
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.460]   - Just wait for the answer.
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.380]   - Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.820]   Okay, so what would happen if you didn't
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.680]   take over my system that way?
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.300]   Condensed from my stomach up to my head
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.460]   when I'm feeling that way?
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.280]   - Yeah.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.340]   Don't think, yeah.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.220]   - Oh, the answers are coming really quick.
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.100]   That I wouldn't be able to discern the truth.
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.740]   - Okay, so the truth is really important
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:25.740]   to this part of you.
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.500]   - Yeah, yeah, because it tends to surface
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.400]   when I'm hearing something that I--
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.240]   - That you know is wrong.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.400]   - That I believe to be fundamentally untrue,
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.060]   typically about my thoughts or feelings, right?
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.500]   I've come, maybe with age, I've come to the conclusion
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.020]   that two people can look at the same interaction
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:49.380]   or same thing and have two very different versions of it.
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.020]   I'm okay with that.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.820]   The part that I'm very, very sensitive to,
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.220]   people in my life know this,
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.340]   is when someone else tells me how I feel.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.180]   - Right.
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.700]   - And what my motives are, or how I feel.
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.580]   That, to me, is like, (mimics explosion)
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:08.580]   that's kind of a hard, fast way to engage this thing.
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.620]   - Okay, so just stay with this thing, just stay with it.
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.940]   - Okay.
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.500]   - And let it know you get that,
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.780]   that having people misinterpret your motives
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.840]   is really, really hard for it.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.180]   And ask it more about that.
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.700]   Just, again, don't think, but ask why that's so hard,
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.780]   why does that bother it so much,
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:34.420]   and what's it afraid would happen if it let that go?
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.640]   - Yeah, so what, why are you afraid to,
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.220]   or why do you have to step in when that happens?
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.820]   My answer is not going to be very satisfying
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.920]   for the listeners, but, or for me.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:51.100]   But it, it's saying,
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:56.100]   because if you can't hold on to your truth,
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.740]   then nothing will make sense.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.380]   - So there's something about making sense,
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.300]   or not, nothing making sense, that it's really scared of.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.140]   Is that right?
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.100]   - Yeah, I mean, I decided to become a biologist,
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:17.340]   and to try and understand the meat inside our heads
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.780]   and body that is the nervous system,
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.860]   because I felt, and I still feel,
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.460]   that it can reveal some fundamental facts or truths.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.940]   It's, you know, understanding reality, as it were,
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.260]   is really important to me,
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:36.260]   because I feel like humans, including myself, of course,
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:41.940]   are so prone to misinterpretation.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:47.780]   So like the truth as a thing out there,
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.620]   I'm willing to let go of completely, like completely.
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:56.100]   The truth as it exists for knowing for certain
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:00.220]   what my motivations were, or what did or didn't happen,
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.860]   but typically it's about motivation.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.700]   What did or didn't happen,
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.220]   you usually can parse with somebody.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.060]   - Yeah.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:09.900]   - That's something I feel I need to protect at all costs.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.940]   - Yeah, so speaking of protect,
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.240]   and so this is a protector part, right?
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.700]   Ask it if it's protecting other parts of you
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.300]   that are vulnerable and get hurt
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:25.300]   when someone misattunes to what your motive is.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.180]   Just ask that question, don't think.
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.020]   - That's an easy, that's a fast one.
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.900]   Not easy, but it's a fast one.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:36.340]   Yeah, the part of me that feels injured by that
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:41.340]   is the fact that I believe that I,
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.820]   at least at the beginning
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.980]   and throughout most of a relationship,
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.900]   and even if a relationship ends for whatever reason,
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.900]   that I know it's my nature to try and imagine
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.700]   as much goodness in the intent
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.740]   of the other person as possible.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.420]   So if I were to let go of this response,
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:09.220]   keep going, in my mind I'm calling it like this,
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.060]   it's like a titanium teddy bear shaped thing,
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.340]   but it doesn't, it's not even feel like a,
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.400]   it's like a titanium block there.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:23.660]   I would potentially move into a mode of judgment of them.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:29.180]   It's interesting because I,
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.300]   there are many people from my past
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.820]   and maybe even a few from my present
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.540]   that people close to me who are pretty well-qualified
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.980]   tell me like I should dislike them
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.340]   or cut them out of my life.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.620]   And I don't, there are a few,
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.380]   maybe one or two instances of people
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.360]   I've cut out of my life,
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.580]   but it's my inclination always to just try and see
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.500]   what can exist.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.780]   So that, and that part feels important to me.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.740]   I don't know why it's important
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.540]   now that I've come to think about it.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.380]   Like-
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.660]   - Well, we can ask, but-
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.500]   - Yeah.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.060]   - So what I'm hearing is this guy,
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:09.060]   this titanium guy is keeping at bay another part
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.860]   that can be very judgmental of the other person.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.740]   - Yeah, I don't like feeling that.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.580]   - Yeah.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.420]   - It feels energetically wasteful.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.260]   - Yeah.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.860]   - And it feels, more than that, it feels incredibly sad.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:20.700]   - Yeah.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.060]   - It's sort of like, I think to accept that part of myself
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.620]   is to kind of give up on some fantasy,
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.620]   which is probably an unrealistic fantasy,
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.620]   which is why I'm calling it a fantasy, I realize.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.460]   - Yeah.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.580]   - Yeah, like this, because I look at,
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.020]   and I always have since I was a kid,
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.940]   I look at people as we are among the animals.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.300]   We're the curators of the earth
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.020]   'cause we're good at technology development,
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:50.420]   but aside from that, and our, just like you wouldn't,
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.740]   I can't imagine that a raccoon looks at another raccoon
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.780]   and it's like, that's a bad raccoon.
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:57.620]   - Right.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:58.540]   - It's just a rabid raccoon.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.460]   - Right.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:04.460]   - And they just, I sort of yearn for the same-
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.780]   - Yeah.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.500]   - The same sensitivity to our own species.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.340]   - I get that.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.460]   - Yeah, like, I don't hate anybody.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.700]   - Well, there might be parts of you that do, but-
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.020]   - I hate behaviors.
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:17.860]   - Okay.
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.140]   - I hate things that people have said or done,
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.140]   not, certainly, mostly to other people, not to me,
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:28.140]   but yeah, being, like, really being angry at someone
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.620]   in a pervasive way, not just in the moment-
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.460]   - Yeah.
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.980]   - Is something that's very difficult for me.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.220]   - But what I'm hearing, what we heard from this part,
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.540]   it's afraid, if it doesn't do this,
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.420]   a part that judges the other,
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:49.420]   probably in a not-so-nice way, would be released.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.020]   Does that sound right?
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:51.860]   - Yeah.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.780]   - So there is that part in there.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.460]   It's just that you've been able to kind of exile it.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.260]   - Yes.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.100]   - Okay.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.820]   - Yeah, I'm comfortable with the idea
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.020]   that you take the appropriate amount of distance,
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.740]   could be zero or could be near infinite,
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.420]   but that I should take the appropriate amount of distance
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:11.660]   from things and people
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.020]   so that I can be in the most loving stance
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.580]   toward them for that.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.300]   - I'm not trying to sound technical here
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.660]   with all the parallel constructions,
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.020]   but I've thought this through a lot.
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.180]   Like, there's some people that I,
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.540]   that there's no limit to the extent
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.220]   to which I want to interact with them.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.220]   You know, we have other things to do
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.780]   and I can spend all our time together.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.020]   And then there are other people that I love them,
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:38.140]   but I know that I have to keep a certain amount of distance
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.860]   in order to continue to love them.
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.220]   This is the same thing.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.180]   So in that moment, it's almost like,
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.940]   but it's coming up without my conscious thing.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:47.820]   It's not like saying, listen,
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.180]   that's the kind of person I can, you know,
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.460]   talk to like once a month or something.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.380]   And I'll just add, you know, in professional settings,
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.220]   not now, but in the distant past,
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.220]   when I was in a very hierarchical structure of,
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.580]   I'm still in academia, I still teach,
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:08.260]   but not running research anymore formally.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.940]   You know, like I had a couple senior colleagues
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.980]   that I really loved and respected,
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.540]   but that they would say or do things
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.300]   that I thought were frankly unethical to other people.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.180]   And to me, I felt them as kind of abrasive.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.780]   So I might, like the physical manifestation of this is,
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:30.420]   I would make it a point to like walk past their office door
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.660]   quickly so that they didn't say,
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.620]   hey, 'cause I don't want to interact.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.580]   But I don't, I'm not familiar
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.780]   with cutting people out of my life.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.500]   I'm just not familiar with doing that.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.020]   I don't, I sort of don't believe in it as a value.
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.180]   - Let's pause for a second.
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.020]   I'll give you a little overview of where we are.
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.060]   So we started with this guy who came up with your friend
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.660]   and is trying to protect that relationship
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:58.280]   because if you continue to be misunderstood
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.460]   in terms of your motives, it would have an impact.
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.300]   Does that sound right?
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.500]   - Yeah, the only thing I'll add is a family member.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.540]   Yeah, not that matters, but close family member, yeah.
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:11.420]   - And in exploring this part,
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:16.160]   asking what it's afraid would happen if it didn't do that.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.980]   So there's this other part that might come out
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:24.460]   that would be very judgmental of that family member
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.860]   and really might have a bad influence
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.540]   on your relationship with that person.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.500]   Does that sound right?
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.460]   - That's correct.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.380]   - Okay, so we have these two,
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.780]   well, we have you who's noticing all this,
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.380]   which we should talk more about.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.580]   And then we have these two parts that are sort of polarized,
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:47.580]   but one, the judgmental one, you really don't like.
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:52.080]   And so you really go to lengths to keep it bay.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.640]   And you kind of admire this guy,
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.740]   but you also know that he can get in the way at times too.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.700]   Does all that sound right?
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.540]   - Yeah, that's right,
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.380]   because I'm describing a recent situation
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.700]   where the presence of this like titanium teddy bear,
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.700]   sorry, I don't know why that's amusing to me to say that.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.500]   The shape of a teddy bear,
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.660]   I'm not seeing a teddy bear in there,
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.540]   but roughly that size and shape.
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:23.420]   It creates a protection, but a pressure internally
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.020]   that's super uncomfortable.
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:27.920]   It's actually taken me a couple of days to dissipate this.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:33.760]   And I do think somewhat counter to the way I'm describing it,
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:41.040]   it doesn't prevent me from saying something.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.400]   It actually, if it's too much,
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.620]   it's almost like that's when words start coming out
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.360]   and they're not kind.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.320]   So it's not a real protector in the sense
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.800]   like it's preventing me from a course of action
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.040]   I don't wanna take.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.840]   It's more, it feels like it's kind of extruding
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.680]   all this stuff.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.360]   And obviously I'm responsible for my words and actions.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.640]   I know that, but it does feel like it creates kind of a--
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.480]   - It kind of takes over.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.420]   - It takes over, yeah, that's the way to put it.
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:13.200]   - So let's go through that again.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.580]   So first of all, I'm so grateful
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.560]   that you're willing to be this vulnerable
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.140]   and expose these parts.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:27.940]   So this guy, actually they're both probably
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:31.820]   what we call firefighters and very reactive.
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.540]   There's maybe some other very vulnerable part
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.620]   that is involved here we haven't heard about.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:42.180]   But if I were to be, if we continue to work together,
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.780]   I would work to get permission
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.740]   to go to the judgmental guy too.
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:51.320]   And what you would find is he's a protector too.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.400]   He's not just a bunch of negative thoughts about people.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:59.120]   And as I was hearing earlier,
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.740]   you've spent a lot of time in your life
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:07.100]   trying to be fair to people and to not judge them
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.620]   and to see them, what they do is just their behaviors
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:14.460]   and not who they are, which is great.
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.540]   But in the process of doing that sometimes
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.420]   we wind up having to push away the parts
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:23.160]   that wanna judge and wanna hate and so on.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:27.960]   And what I find is if we can go there
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.780]   and get to know them, they're just protectors too
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:37.780]   and they're young and when they are able
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:41.180]   to unload the hate they might carry,
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:45.020]   the judgment, they'll transform.
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:48.740]   So this is a model of transformation in that sense.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:53.140]   And there are no bad parts, you go to everybody in there,
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:57.600]   regardless of how you think, how bad they are.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.140]   And you get curious about them
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.180]   and you learn how they're trying to protect.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:06.340]   And then we help them out of their protective roles
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.380]   and help them trust.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.280]   There's a you, who you talked about with Martha,
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.420]   who can run things, but they don't have to do it
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.920]   'cause most of them are young.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:21.900]   And get them to trust this you to handle your family member
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.580]   rather than they have to take over
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:28.020]   or try to take over in the way they did.
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.060]   Does this make any sense?
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.660]   - Yeah, it makes total sense.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.460]   You know, what you said at the beginning,
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.260]   permission to go to the judgmental part.
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:40.260]   I was just, my mind flits when I hear that, flits too.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.500]   You know, two possibilities, one's a novel possibility,
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.900]   one's a familiar possibility.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.420]   The familiar possibility is if I were to really feel
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.340]   the disappointment that I'm feeling
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:01.340]   when this pattern in the other person shows up again,
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.140]   'cause at least it seems to,
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.140]   I'm very familiar with the pattern,
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:10.140]   then it would fundamentally like change
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.140]   the way that I feel about them.
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:12.960]   - That's right.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.860]   - I'm just trying to hold on to the goodness in it.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.700]   - That's right.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.820]   - But of course, I wanna be very clear,
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.900]   not just for anyone listening, but for myself too,
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:25.900]   that clearly that the protecting role
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:30.860]   of this titanium teddy bear has created something
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.140]   where what the times when things have broken through
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.100]   from my side, they're not kind.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.020]   - Right.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.740]   - And or they're spoken in a way
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.020]   that just is not constructive.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:42.860]   - Right.
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:47.860]   - Right, so yeah.
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.340]   And then the second possibility is that,
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.100]   I hadn't considered this possibility,
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:58.100]   but the second possibility is that were I to
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.800]   let myself feel that disappointment,
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.900]   that maybe the relationship could persist.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:08.440]   Like I've been looking at those things as mutually-
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.280]   - Exclusive.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.100]   - Exclusive.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.180]   - Yeah.
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:15.880]   - And as I say all this, I also realized that,
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:20.180]   well, the honest disclaimer is like,
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.200]   I don't wanna give the impression
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.100]   that I don't judge people.
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.940]   I'm human and I certainly do.
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.620]   I'm just saying that when there's a relationship
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:30.180]   that I wish to maintain, I'll go to great lengths
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:34.140]   to push aside knowledge of my own experience
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.400]   and or just judgment.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:39.660]   I've made this, I've engaged in this pattern
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.900]   in ways that ended up being extremely destructive to me
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.780]   by completely like putting the blinders
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.160]   onto things that were right in front of me.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.000]   - And that's what I'm talking about.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:49.820]   - Consciously.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.660]   - That's what I'm talking about.
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.420]   - Because I adored the person so much in other dimensions,
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.660]   like that, and it's not a, for lack of a better word,
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.440]   a holistic way to approach things.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.220]   But I also will say that in contrast
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:05.820]   to those types of relationships,
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:09.900]   the relationships where the titanium tenor
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.060]   where it's not required feel to me.
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.300]   So like by comparison,
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.540]   but also in the absolute scale feel to me,
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.820]   like the best possible relationships one could have.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.620]   They're like pinch me type of relationships,
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:24.500]   like our friendship, some of my relationships to family,
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.540]   like my coworkers and there are others too.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.260]   Certainly I had romantic relationships like that,
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.060]   relationships, my relationship to my dog.
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.820]   It's trivial as people might think that seems
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.060]   to the contrast of that,
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:40.680]   like where there's no need for this protector part.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.860]   It's like the best thing
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:48.140]   because it feels completely safe and uninhibited.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:48.980]   I never have to worry
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:52.540]   that I'm gonna be taken over from the inside.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.980]   Nor do I ever worry that I'm gonna like really screw up.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.780]   And I hope that if I do screw up, they'll tell me,
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:03.780]   but like it's the complete absence of fear.
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.060]   - So let me check in and just see how this has been
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:11.260]   to discuss and focus and so on.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.500]   What's it been like to do this process?
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:21.580]   - It's a lot in the sense that I don't like feeling
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:24.820]   that titanium thing, teddy bear.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.620]   It's been very informative.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.260]   So it's balanced by that.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.580]   And maybe that's why I went into a little riff
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.460]   about the pleasant relationships
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.980]   and how outsized positive they are for me.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:44.420]   They're like a salve and an elixir for me
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:48.780]   that maybe I gave myself a little like wash over with that
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.740]   'cause it's pretty uncomfortable,
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:54.420]   but it's really informative.
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:57.280]   And it also tells me that the internal family systems work
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.660]   that I did with someone else was an attempt at this,
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.180]   but so very different, which makes sense
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.240]   because this is your art and science.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.820]   So I'm grateful.
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.380]   Yeah, it feels good.
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:10.780]   - What I was saying earlier is if we were to pursue it,
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:15.460]   we could get to the point where the teddy bear guy
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.020]   could unload the feelings he carries
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.820]   that makes it so uncomfortable and he would transform.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.140]   - How would we go about doing that?
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:27.900]   - You would focus on him again.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.460]   You would explore more of what he's protecting.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.820]   Either we would go to the guy he's trying to keep at bay
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:35.960]   that would ruin a relationship,
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.060]   or often these parts are protecting
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.260]   something much more vulnerable from your past.
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:45.180]   Some young part that's stuck somewhere in the past
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.860]   that has a big issue about being misunderstood
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.500]   in terms of motives or something.
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:54.340]   - Yeah, not that I need clarity on this right now,
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:59.260]   but it's more that it protects the possibility
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.220]   of a relationship at all.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.380]   I think the fear is like,
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.100]   if I were to look through my lens of truth
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.040]   at what's happened or is happening in the moment,
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.020]   if I were a "better boundaried person,"
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:12.460]   it'd be done yesterday.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:17.380]   So it's sort of like a desire to live out a fantasy.
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.340]   - Got it.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.820]   - I mean, if I'm honest.
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:24.200]   - So that would be the part that we would go to
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.020]   that it protects, that has this fantasy
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.120]   of what a relationship should be or could be,
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.500]   who might be stuck somewhere in the past,
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.820]   and we would witness,
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.740]   you know, you talked with Martha about compassionate witness,
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.920]   we would witness where he's stuck
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.420]   and what was happening back then,
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:45.900]   and then I would have you go in
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.700]   and get him out of that time period.
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:53.580]   Then we'd have him unload the desire for that fantasy
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.200]   that keeps you getting hurt,
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.680]   and then I would have the teddy bear see
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.760]   it doesn't have to protect him anymore,
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.520]   and then we would help the teddy bear
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.620]   unload the feelings he carries,
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.200]   and then he could relax,
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.960]   and they would all start to trust you,
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.240]   which we should talk about a little bit now.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.760]   Who is you?
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.480]   Who's separate from these others?
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:21.200]   - For the record, I never owned a teddy bear as a kid.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.560]   I had a stuffed frog.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:23.400]   - I had a teddy bear.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.920]   - I had a, well, I'm not embarrassed to tell you,
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.300]   I had a stuffed frog that I loved,
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.640]   it was an Afraidy the Frog,
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:31.920]   and so I don't know where the teddy bear thing came up,
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.640]   but it was, the shape was so very clear.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.800]   - But let me just elaborate on what I was just saying,
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   'cause when you separated from him and you found him here,
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.720]   and I asked you how you felt toward him,
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.960]   and you had an attitude about him at first, remember?
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.560]   We got that to relax and got curious about him.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.560]   Then you started to access more of what I call yourself
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.800]   with a capital S.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.720]   - So it comes through curiosity.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.380]   - Well, often starts with curiosity.
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.620]   And just to backtrack a little bit,
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:12.160]   so when I would have these clients in the early days
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.320]   starting to work with these parts,
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.980]   like the critic and so on,
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.960]   and once I got hip to the fact they weren't what they seemed,
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.280]   that they deserved to be listened to
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.720]   rather than fought with,
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:28.560]   so I would help the parts that hated them step out,
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.600]   and clients could do that pretty readily.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.960]   And then I would say,
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.600]   now how do you feel toward this critic?
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:36.760]   And spontaneously people would say,
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.000]   I'm just curious about why he calls me names all the time.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.960]   Or even would say, I feel sorry for it
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.320]   that it has to do this, I'm gonna help it.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:48.620]   And when they were in that state,
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.100]   and I would ask, what part of you is that?
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.540]   That's great, let's keep that around.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.140]   They'd say, that's not a part like these others, that's me.
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.780]   That's my essence, or that's my self.
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.220]   So I came to call that the self with a capital S.
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.660]   40 years later, thousands of people
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.860]   doing this all over the world.
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.620]   Turns out that that self is in everybody
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:14.380]   just beneath the surface of these parts
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:18.100]   so that when they open space, you can access it quickly,
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.700]   and has all these great qualities,
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.620]   what I call the eight Cs.
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:26.420]   So curious, but also calm, confident,
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:31.420]   compassionate, courageous, clear,
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.720]   creative, and connected.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:39.300]   And that person knows how to heal these parts.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:43.580]   So once I get somebody in a lot of what we call self,
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.900]   I'll just say, okay, what do you wanna say to this part?
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.820]   And how does it react?
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.860]   And now what do you wanna do with the part?
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.100]   I can kind of get out of the way.
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.740]   And one of the hallmarks of IFS,
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.780]   as opposed to a lot of other therapies,
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:59.580]   is that it's not so much about me becoming
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:04.420]   that good attachment figure to these hurting parts of you,
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:06.140]   these inner children.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.300]   You become that.
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.660]   You become the good attachment figure yourself,
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:11.900]   or the good inner parent,
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:16.260]   or the good internal leader for these parts.
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:19.060]   And they come to trust you as a leader.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.340]   And then you get into it with your family member,
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.460]   and you just remind the part, no, I can handle this.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.940]   Just let me stay.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:29.460]   And now when that happens with my wife,
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:32.820]   sometimes, not on a good day,
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.660]   I can stay in the C-word qualities
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.380]   and have a totally different conversation with her
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.260]   than if that protector took over.
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.580]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.780]   and thank our sponsor, AG1.
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.860]   AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral,
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.260]   probiotic drink with adaptogens.
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.140]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.620]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.340]   The reason I started taking AG1,
[00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.060]   and the reason I still take AG1,
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.580]   is because it is the highest quality
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.460]   and most complete foundational nutritional supplement.
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.460]   What that means is that AG1 ensures
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:07.220]   that you're getting all the necessary vitamins, minerals,
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.860]   and other micronutrients to form a strong foundation
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.260]   for your daily health.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.900]   AG1 also has probiotics and prebiotics
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.860]   that support a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.860]   Your gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.580]   that align your digestive tract
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:23.060]   and impact things such as your immune system status,
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.060]   your metabolic health, your hormone health, and much more.
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:29.060]   So I've consistently found that when I take AG1 daily,
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:32.260]   my digestion is improved, my immune system is more robust,
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.860]   and my mood and mental focus are at their best.
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.060]   In fact, if I could take just one supplement,
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.300]   that supplement would be AG1.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.700]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:43.900]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman

[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.140]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Wealthfront.
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:00.720]   I've been using Wealthfront for my savings
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.480]   and my investing for nearly a decade,
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.960]   and I absolutely love it.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.060]   At the start of every year, I set new goals,
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.740]   and one of my goals for 2025 is to focus on saving money.
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:10.900]   Since I have Wealthfront,
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.380]   I'll keep that savings in my Wealthfront cash account,
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.660]   where I'm able to earn 4% annual percentage yield
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.020]   on my deposits, and you can as well.
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.660]   With Wealthfront, you can earn 4% APY on your cash

[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.780]   to either spend that money or invest it.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.960]   With Wealthfront, you also get free instant withdrawals
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.800]   to eligible accounts every day,

[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.220]   The 4% APY is not a promotional rate,
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.300]   and there's no limit to what you can deposit and earn.
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.100]   And you can even get protection for up to $8 million
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.780]   through FDIC insurance provided
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.700]   through Wealthfront's partner banks.

[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:51.540]   from the cash account
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.940]   to any of Wealthfront's automated investment accounts

[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.480]   This has been a paid testimonial of Wealthfront.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.340]   Wealthfront brokerage isn't a bank.
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:22.340]   The APY is subject to change.
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.500]   For more information, see the episode description.
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.860]   I'm struck by a couple of things
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:32.860]   that I think people will be, if I may, wise to think about.
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:37.180]   One is, yeah, in the classic psychodynamic
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.380]   or CBT model of therapy,
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:44.260]   it's clear that the client or patient,
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:45.940]   sometimes it's called, right?
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.460]   Patient-therapist relationship is one
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:52.300]   where it takes on certain components
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:55.220]   that exist in the outside world with other people.
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.620]   And it's always slightly bothered me
[00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:04.740]   slash concerned me that that's the structure.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:09.180]   And as you said, in IFS, internal family systems,
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.820]   you become your own kind of therapist,
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.540]   if you will, for lack of a better way to put it.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:19.540]   I like that because there's so much discussion nowadays
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:23.620]   about parenting yourself and this kind of thing
[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:26.900]   and learning to mother yourself and father yourself.
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:28.520]   And I actually think there's great value in that.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.700]   I mean, I learned by living alone,
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.600]   how to cook for myself and clean for myself.
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.780]   These are, I'm mapping to stereotypes here,
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:38.900]   but also to protect myself and to organize myself
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:40.500]   and be very, very disciplined.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:43.020]   And actually running a laboratory
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.660]   was a great teaching there
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.620]   'cause you're basically a single academic parent
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.020]   to all these people.
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:50.820]   So you have to, you quickly realize
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:52.700]   where you lack maternal instincts
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:56.580]   and where you may lack or overemphasize
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:59.140]   or have hypertrophied paternal instincts.
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:02.640]   So that was a good forum to see my weaknesses
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.440]   and hopefully some strengths too.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.360]   So I like this idea
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.380]   that one can play those roles for oneself.
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:13.280]   How is IFS typically done
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.700]   if somebody doesn't have access to a therapist
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:16.920]   who's expert in it,
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:20.280]   or is that really the only proper gateway into it?
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.640]   - No, so-
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.720]   - 'Cause I'm sitting here with the master,
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:28.460]   the founder, and I'm very grateful, by the way,
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:29.780]   for the work we just did.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.220]   So thank you, it feels good.
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:33.060]   - It was a privilege.
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:33.900]   - Yeah, thank you.
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:34.820]   Yeah, likewise.
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:39.020]   But most people won't have direct one-on-one access to you.
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:44.020]   So it's very experiential.
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:49.640]   I imagine in books and courses,
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.800]   people can learn how to do this.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.300]   And by the way, this was not preconceived
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.060]   as a pitch for books and courses,
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:56.500]   but I'm wondering,
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.740]   can somebody do this on their own the very first time?
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:00.580]   That's what I wanna know.
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:01.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.740]   So for a long time,
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.900]   I resisted trying to take this directly to the public
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:11.420]   because I learned the hard way that some systems,
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.940]   particularly people with huge amounts of trauma,
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.420]   are quite delicate.
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:19.960]   And if you start going to the part we talked about
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.380]   that's vulnerable inside,
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.820]   that has this view of relationships,
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:28.240]   this kind of idealized view of relationships of yours,
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.200]   would be what I call an exile,
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.700]   that if we were to go to it,
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:38.900]   and we won't today
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:41.140]   'cause it requires a lot of vulnerability,
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:42.980]   but if we were to,
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:46.260]   a lot of extreme protectors might come out
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:49.220]   and then people start to get scared.
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:54.220]   So it took a long time to figure out
[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:57.300]   how we might bring it to the public in a safer way.
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:01.900]   And so we just put out a workbook for people
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:05.700]   and it doesn't involve necessarily going to those places,
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:07.380]   but there's a huge amount you can do
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.660]   just by working the way we started to
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:12.740]   with these protectors and getting to know them
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.140]   and know that they're not you.
[00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:15.980]   They're just a part trying their best.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.080]   And no, it's not anything negative.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.780]   That judgmental part you've got such an attitude about
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:22.780]   or fear of,
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:27.260]   if you were just to begin getting curious about it
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.360]   and getting to know it a bit,
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.660]   you'd find out that it's a very valuable part
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:34.680]   that has a lot of discernment, like you said,
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.300]   you know, and wants desperately to keep you
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:40.300]   from getting in these relationships where you get hurt
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:45.220]   and gets so judgmental because you don't listen to it.
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.140]   Do you follow what I'm saying?
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:48.180]   - I do.
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.020]   I do.
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:50.180]   In fact, something pops to mind,
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:51.980]   maybe I could just ask you about it.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:55.780]   My mind's right on what you're saying,
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.420]   but you know, something occurred to me as you said it,
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:03.040]   which is if I were to, for instance,
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.140]   really feel the feeling of like,
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:07.560]   hey, that's really screwed up or like that's not,
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.300]   like actually feel the disappointment or judgment
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:13.760]   that this titanium teddy bear is trying to protect against,
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:18.940]   I realize it leads to a lot of role confusion
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.360]   and identity confusion.
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.200]   - That's right.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.740]   - And I'll just be very blunt.
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:25.100]   It's probably not the best thing to do on a podcast,
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:27.220]   but I'm going to do it anyway, which is, you know,
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:29.740]   this is how I feel about modern politics.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:33.660]   I see things on the left that make sense to me
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:36.660]   and things that are to me, just absolutely ludicrous,
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:41.660]   inappropriate and offensive and like just badly wrong.
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.960]   I see things on the right that make a ton of sense to me
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:49.020]   and also things that are inappropriate, offensive and wrong.
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.140]   And as a consequence, I'm trying to see the best,
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:54.200]   the goodness in both sides and just kind of create
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.540]   this kind of a Swiss cheese model of the world,
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:59.660]   talking about politics, 'cause it's just simpler to do
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.540]   and people at least know what the groups
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.500]   we're talking about.
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:07.380]   And, but then it leads me in a place of no affiliation.
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:10.580]   And I'm then between one of two stances,
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:13.960]   one of just kind of standing there being like, yeah,
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.180]   well, there's no real position in the middle
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:18.640]   that is an official position in the middle,
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:23.020]   but it also makes me just want to put up the middle finger
[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:25.980]   to both and say, I'm a double hater, but of course,
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:29.180]   I'm an adult and a citizen who cares about people
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:30.020]   in the country.
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:33.720]   And so I feel like to be an adult, I can't opt out,
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:36.140]   but there's like, I feel unaffiliated.
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.060]   I feel like there's no option for me.
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:42.140]   And this maps pretty well to, I think,
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:44.640]   the identity and role confusion that I feel
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:49.320]   when I place my, again, understanding the truth
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:54.060]   is a complicated thing, but my judgment on things
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.680]   and people is like, well, then what is my role as a son?
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.960]   What is my role as a partner?
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:01.680]   What is my role if this thing is true?
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:05.200]   And so it's a way I'm realizing of protecting
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.640]   the simplicity of a role.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.040]   And I did grow up in a home where like the roles were like,
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.680]   you know, you're a son, you do certain things,
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:16.680]   like, you know, you do, you know, and so,
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.420]   but I also have a rebellious side to me.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:23.420]   So the role confusion is something that I imagine
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:26.640]   a lot of people are familiar with.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.200]   - Yeah.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:32.420]   - And when one, and I also believe that when you just really
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:35.880]   say, well, they did something bad, therefore all bad,
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.680]   therefore I'm part of the opposite team.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:38.520]   - Right.
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.840]   - Which to me is an unlived life.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:41.680]   - Yeah.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.680]   - It's like, but I see a lot of people do it.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.020]   And actually sometimes I'm envious of people
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:50.220]   that have that ability because they seem so unconflicted.
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:51.240]   - Right.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.960]   - So it's a tough thing to be a thinking, feeling person
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.120]   at the level of nuance.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:55.960]   - Yeah.
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.440]   - It kind of sucks sometimes.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.280]   - Yeah.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:02.400]   - I'd rather do that than be a double hater
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:06.880]   or just cleanly opt in.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.720]   - Yeah.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:08.560]   - Does that make sense?
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:09.380]   - Totally makes sense.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:10.220]   - Okay.
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:13.600]   - And what I'm hearing is that when you're looking
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:18.120]   at a person or a political party or issue in the world,
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.360]   you'll hear from these conflicted parts.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:24.320]   They each have perspective, just like our country now,
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.220]   hears from these conflicted parts.
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:30.400]   But you don't have a lot of access to what I'm calling self
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.800]   in those contexts.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.720]   'Cause one of the C words is clarity.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:39.480]   So again, as I was listening to you and Martha,
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:41.360]   you were talking about how there are times
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.680]   where you just have this sense in your body
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.380]   of what's right or what's true.
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:47.600]   That's what I'm calling self.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:49.300]   Self has that clarity.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:54.320]   And self sees injustice and self,
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:59.320]   some of those C words are courage, confidence and clarity.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:06.100]   So there's an impulse also to act to correct imbalance,
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.200]   to correct injustice too.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.280]   So self isn't a kind of passive witness
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:14.960]   as it is in a lot of spiritual traditions in IFS.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:18.120]   It's an active inner leader, it's an active external leader.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:23.640]   And too often, our actions are driven
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.860]   by these protective parts.
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:27.920]   And that's true in our politics now too.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:33.220]   So one of my goals is to try to bring more self leadership
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:36.760]   to the world, to all these conflicts.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:42.340]   But to do that, people have to unburden,
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:44.620]   they have to release these extreme beliefs and emotions
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:46.620]   they got from their traumas in the past.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:51.100]   We have a concept we call legacy burdens.
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:55.940]   So many people have inherited these extreme beliefs
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:58.900]   and emotions that came down through their ancestors.
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:03.980]   And drive their parts, drive their extremes.
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:06.700]   And many conflicts in the world
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.800]   are driven by these legacy burdens.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:13.760]   And we've gotten good at helping people unload these things.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.540]   - Yeah, we've seen this in the Middle East recently.
[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:18.420]   - Totally, and we're doing a lot of work
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:19.260]   in the Middle East.
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:21.780]   So we have training programs there,
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:24.300]   we have, and one of my visions
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:28.300]   is to have large scale legacy unburdenings
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:30.100]   where large groups of people come together
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:33.660]   and we help them unload the Holocaust legacy burdens
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:38.100]   on the one side and the 1941 legacy burdens
[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:39.820]   on the Palestinian side.
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:44.820]   And have more self accessible to each side.
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:47.180]   And when, like when we do couples therapy
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:51.260]   or we do other kinds of negotiated conflict,
[00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:53.580]   if people's parts start getting into it,
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:54.880]   we'll just say time out.
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:58.940]   You sort of did this on your own with your family member.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:02.500]   Just say time out, want both of you to go inside,
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.340]   find the parts that have been doing the speaking.
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:08.180]   Don't come back until you can speak for them
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:09.340]   but not from them.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:13.300]   And come back in these C word qualities,
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:15.100]   in that state of self.
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:17.420]   We can hold people in that,
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:20.320]   it's really easy to get out of the conflict.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.580]   If their protectors are going at it all the time,
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:25.800]   conflicts never change, so.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:32.220]   - Do you think that people who have the reflex
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:38.180]   or the ability to kind of somaticize a bit,
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.640]   like I obviously, I don't think of myself as somebody
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.220]   who's like psychosomatic.
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:45.180]   I don't have stomach aches and headaches and stuff
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.320]   unless I caught a virus, you know.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:51.140]   But I can feel where certain things are in my body
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.080]   pretty quickly and always have.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.800]   Do you think that IFS lends itself better
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:03.800]   to people who, you know, feel things somatically
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.520]   versus people that are like really cognitive
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.360]   and in their head?
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.800]   'Cause I have that component too.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.280]   I can actually feel the switch.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.120]   - Yeah.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.820]   - Like I do it through, I'll go into like a narrative
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.440]   and then I start to see the structure like up here.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.360]   - Yeah.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.360]   - And--
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.680]   - Yeah, that happened several times
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.000]   when we were working together.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.760]   Like I would have you stay with something
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.280]   and then the narrator part would kick in.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.120]   - Yeah.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.940]   - And then I would try to refocus you.
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:32.480]   But, you know, I've lived in Boston for 10 years,
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.200]   so I worked with lots of cognitive people
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.440]   who didn't know their bodies, who had, you know,
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:43.440]   just were in that rat race to try and get tenure and so on.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.680]   - Been there.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.520]   - Yes, me too.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.520]   - Yeah.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.080]   Tenure's nice, but one should tend to their emotional cells
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.920]   while they're pursuing it.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.840]   But just to answer your question, they can do it,
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:59.400]   but we first have to start with that thinking part
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.160]   and get it on board and get it to step out
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.520]   and to stay out long enough that they can feel their bodies.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:11.320]   So, yeah, you know, it lends itself to anybody,
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.960]   but with people like that,
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.920]   it takes a while for that thinking part to trust
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:18.480]   that it's safe to let them into their bodies.
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.520]   - So if we were to just step back for a moment
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.680]   and do sort of a top contour summary of the process,
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:33.760]   someone brings forward a memory,
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:37.120]   a recent or distant memory of something
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.560]   that made them feel not good,
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.880]   and you try and localize some sensation in the body,
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:44.720]   get a sense of its location.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.260]   - Let me pause there, I'll tell you why.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.080]   - Yeah.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.200]   - Because if they find it in their body,
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:51.580]   and they direct the question there
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:54.100]   and they wait for the answer to come from there,
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:56.300]   they're less likely to be in their head.
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.820]   So it sort of short-circuits that thinking part.
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:02.380]   So many people come to therapy,
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.620]   and that thinking part thinks
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:05.300]   it's supposed to do the therapy.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.180]   It's, you know, CBT or whatever.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.520]   Even a lot of the more, not experiential,
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.360]   but a lot of the more psychodynamic therapies,
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.640]   the thinking part is really trying to explain
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.940]   why they feel stuff.
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:19.780]   - Right.
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:21.540]   - So this is getting them out of that
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:25.020]   and getting them to actually listen inside
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.220]   into what they think is their body,
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.100]   but it's really these parts that live down there
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.060]   that they haven't had access to
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:35.340]   'cause the thinking part is running things so much.
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.260]   - Got it.
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:39.420]   And then one places some attention
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.540]   from the stance of curiosity.
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.460]   They're like, what's there, what's it trying to say?
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:45.300]   - Exactly, so.
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.420]   - And then you start to reveal the underlying layers
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.020]   of what's it protecting,
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:53.460]   what are those things that are protective trying to say?
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:55.820]   - Yeah, it's not even you're trying to reveal.
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:58.340]   It's just that you're asking these questions
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:59.900]   and the answers start coming.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.740]   - I see.
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:02.380]   Oh, I love this 'cause I'm a big believer
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.900]   in seeding the unconscious mind
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:05.340]   and then letting things surface,
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:08.740]   either in sleep or in meditative states.
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:15.220]   Has internal family systems been combined
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:18.820]   with some of the therapies that are now getting tested
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:24.860]   still in clinical trial stage around psychedelics?
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.860]   - Yeah, in fact, two days ago,
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:32.580]   we just completed a IFS and ketamine retreat.
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.420]   - Oh, wow.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.220]   - So we had, and we're doing it more and more.
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:36.940]   Like I said, I'm trying to bring this more
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.020]   out of the psychotherapy world.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:44.020]   So we invited 32 leaders to come of various kinds
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:48.020]   and had three days where they do ketamine
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.500]   and then do IFS.
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.100]   The nice thing about psychedelics
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:55.220]   is it puts those manager parts to sleep somehow
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.500]   a lot of the time.
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.420]   - Yeah, I've been open about the fact
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.980]   and I always have to provide the disclaimer.
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.620]   I don't just say this to protect me.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:03.900]   I say this to protect listeners
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:08.900]   that I do think young people should avoid psychedelics.
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.020]   The brain is already in a psychedelic state.
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:11.860]   - I do too, yeah.
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:16.060]   - The amount of plasticity, and this is really tremendous.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:18.780]   And this is coming from somebody who regrets it,
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.940]   but I did psychedelics recreationally as a kid.
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:22.780]   - Me too.
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:24.220]   - And I regret it.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.580]   I returned to them later in a clinical setting
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:31.820]   and derived a lot of benefit, I think, from them,
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:35.660]   namely high-dose psilocybin and MDMA,
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:39.180]   but both of those are still very much illegal.
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.340]   You can get into a lot of trouble for taking them
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.300]   and/or certainly for selling them.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:46.260]   So that's the cautionary note there.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:48.500]   And the clinical trials are really impressive,
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.540]   in my opinion, spectacularly impressive,
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:54.260]   especially for MDMA and for the treatment of PTSD.
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:59.260]   But the FDA, this last year, did not approve MDMA
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.180]   as a treatment for PTSD.
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:04.300]   I think going forward in the new administration,
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:08.220]   it's likely that it will get approved, but who knows?
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:12.340]   So anyway, that's a bunch of pseudo-legalese jargon,
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.220]   but it's sincere.
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:18.100]   If I were an 18 or 19-year-old person
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.220]   or 30-year-old person listening to a conversation
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:22.980]   about psychedelics and how they can be helpful,
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.700]   I would want to also know that there are instances
[01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:26.540]   where people take them
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.100]   and they don't have the appropriate guidance
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:29.900]   in and through it and out of it,
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.100]   and it leads to serious problems.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.900]   So this is a real, real thing that we're talking about.
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.300]   And that's why these ketamine clinics
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:41.460]   where they just hand 'em the drugs and the medicine
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.860]   and just leave 'em on their own are scary to me.
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:48.100]   I'm proud to say that IFS has been adopted
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:52.140]   as one of the primary models for psychedelics now,
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.140]   'cause it's a really nice fit.
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.180]   And as I was saying earlier,
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:59.340]   what I see happening often, not always,
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:02.860]   is these manager parts go offline,
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.060]   and that releases a lot of self.
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:10.060]   So you start to just feel those C-word qualities emerging.
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:16.100]   And that's a big invitation to all these exiled parts
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.260]   to come and get attention.
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:22.780]   And so as people come out of the ketamine experience,
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.620]   I can work with 'em for 15 minutes
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:27.780]   and do something that would take maybe five sessions,
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.860]   because they can get access to parts
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:32.260]   that they couldn't get,
[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:35.180]   or it would take a long time to convince their protectors
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:36.980]   to let us go to.
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.740]   And we can unburden those exiles
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:41.660]   and then bring back their protectors.
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:43.980]   And so I love it.
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:45.500]   You know, and ketamine's the legal one,
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.500]   so that's why we do it.
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.660]   And the other nice thing, and I don't know,
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:53.500]   as a scientist, how much you would go with this,
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:58.500]   but ketamine, again, because it opens the door
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.500]   with these protectors,
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.940]   you can also taste what I call the big self.
[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:09.540]   You taste this, what they call non-dual state
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:11.660]   that can be quite blissful.
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:14.980]   And some people go, "God."
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:19.780]   And then as you come back, you have this sense
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:24.260]   of I'm much more than this little body and this little ego,
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.020]   that there is something much bigger.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.060]   And that's why they're using it with "End of Life"
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:33.340]   and why it did, and psilocybin has such a big impact
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:36.980]   on depression and because it sort of lifts you
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:40.660]   out of this little box your protectors have you in,
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.220]   to know that there's something much more, so.
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.060]   - Interesting.
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:45.180]   I've never tried ketamine.
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:49.780]   A few years ago, and I've talked about this publicly
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:54.780]   as well, I started developing a pretty deep relationship
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:59.740]   to spirituality and God, and mostly through the path
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.540]   of giving up control.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:05.620]   I mean, there's a certain, breaking news, folks,
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.220]   you can't control everything, you know?
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:12.220]   And you can control certain things, but most things no.
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:16.020]   And the way you describe, ketamine's very interesting
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:19.060]   because as a dissociative anesthetic,
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:23.340]   it works in such a fundamentally different way
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:27.420]   than say MDMA, which is an empathogen,
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.740]   which makes people feel so much more.
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:34.780]   I mean, I sort of half joke that the,
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:36.820]   aside from the safety legality stuff,
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:41.380]   the concern I have about MDMA is that if one is not
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:45.300]   in the eye mask, if you don't have somebody guiding you
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.700]   through it and taking some notes, you know,
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:50.860]   if you listen to a piece of jazz or classical music
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:53.700]   or your favorite rock and roll album,
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:56.620]   or you're there with your dog or cat or plants,
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:59.340]   I mean, you can spend the entire four hours bonding
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:00.660]   with the plant.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.860]   You're not gonna run off and get married to a plant.
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.380]   You're not gonna try and fornicate with a plant,
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:11.380]   but one hopes, but it's a very precious,
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:16.940]   but very labile situation.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.780]   - Totally agree.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:20.420]   - Because it's such a strong empathogen
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:22.420]   that whatever you direct your attention to,
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:26.540]   internal or external, is going to hypertrophy.
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:29.540]   So just have to be really careful.
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:30.420]   - Totally agree.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:33.780]   - You know, and given that the neurotoxicity issues
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:36.660]   seem worked out in that if it's actually MDMA
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:38.660]   and isn't other things, by the way,
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:41.140]   that the big study that showed neurotoxicity of MDMA
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.940]   in non-human primates,
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:44.940]   turned out they were injecting methamphetamine.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:45.780]   - What?
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:47.060]   - Yeah, that paper was retracted.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.020]   It was published in Science.
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:50.380]   We'll provide a link to the paper and the retraction.
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.620]   That, the retraction was not as publicized.
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.460]   - Wow.
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:55.900]   - Methylene dioxy, methamphetamine, MDMA
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:58.580]   has not been shown to be neurotoxic,
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:00.660]   provided that's what people are taking.
[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.140]   - Wow.
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.340]   - And not taking some combination of other things.
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:08.620]   Yeah, it's a real tragedy the way that retractions
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:11.780]   don't get nearly the kind of popular press coverage
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:14.380]   that initial studies do,
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.900]   regardless of whether or not the initial study
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.060]   was positive or negative.
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.420]   In any case, I do believe there are other routes
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:22.980]   to calming down the forebrain
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.660]   in the context of doing this kind of work
[01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:26.500]   that I'd just like your thoughts on.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:27.340]   - Sure.
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:29.180]   - When I first wake up in the morning,
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:30.940]   I'm in kind of a liminal state,
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:35.940]   but the thing that I don't want to think about
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:37.380]   comes to my brain.
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:38.220]   I can't avoid it.
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:41.380]   It's just like the protectors are not available.
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.540]   They're still asleep.
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:44.140]   So that seems valuable.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.060]   I've tried recently to keep my eyes closed.
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:47.500]   Sometimes I'll get up and use the bathroom,
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:48.380]   but keep my eyes closed,
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:49.540]   stay in that still state,
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:53.340]   and explore the contours of that thing,
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:12:00.340]   provided it's done safely and not anywhere near water.
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:02.660]   Cyclic hyperventilation breath work,
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:06.260]   done for a few minutes or cycles, you know.
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:12.180]   We think can change the brain activity.
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.700]   So the forebrain kind of comes off of line a bit.
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:17.260]   - So all these things just put managers
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:18.100]   to sleep.
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.060]   - Put managers to sleep.
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.860]   - Like when you go to sleep,
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:21.900]   your managers go to sleep,
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.460]   and then you have these weird dreams,
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:26.940]   and that's 'cause your exiles have access to your mind now,
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:29.340]   and they're trying to give you signals
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.380]   about what they want.
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:33.140]   The other thing I'll say about psychedelics
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.780]   and the breathing too,
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:39.260]   is that as your managers go to sleep,
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:42.300]   and your exiles start coming in,
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.980]   it can seem really terrifying,
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:50.500]   'cause these parts are stuck in horrible places often,
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.860]   with a lot of terror.
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:54.620]   And so what's called bad trips,
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.580]   is them trying to get attention.
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:58.820]   So they'll come in and they'll totally take over,
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:01.420]   and you'll look like you're having a panic attack.
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:02.260]   But what we've learned,
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:05.300]   and this happened a few times last week,
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:09.700]   is instead of thinking of it as a panic attack,
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:11.740]   or a bad trip,
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:13.500]   to welcome it.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.660]   Here's a part that needs a lot of attention,
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:19.300]   it's taken over entirely.
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.220]   But if I were to say,
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:24.620]   "Okay, Andrew, I see you're really scared,
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:25.460]   "but how do you feel
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:28.740]   "toward this really scared part that's here now?"
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.180]   And I could get you to say,
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:31.540]   "I feel sorry for it."
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:34.620]   Then I would have you start to get to know it,
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:36.460]   and work with it, and comfort it,
[01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.700]   rather than have a panic attack.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:43.460]   You would access calm and those C words,
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:48.180]   and then it becomes a hugely useful healing
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:50.620]   of something that's in you,
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:53.780]   that's stuck in a terrified place.
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:55.020]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:57.820]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Function.
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:59.420]   Last year, I became a Function member
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.700]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:03.180]   to lab testing.
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.140]   Function provides over 100 advanced lab tests
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.660]   that give you a key snapshot
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:09.580]   of your entire bodily health.
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.220]   This snapshot offers you with insights
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.020]   on your heart health, hormone health,
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:16.220]   immune functioning, nutrient levels, and much more.
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:18.260]   They've also recently added tests for toxins,
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:20.860]   such as BPA exposure from harmful plastics,
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:23.820]   and tests for PFASs, or forever chemicals.
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:25.380]   Function not only provides testing
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:26.940]   of over 100 biomarkers key
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.660]   to your physical and mental health,
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.500]   but it also analyzes these results
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.660]   and provides insights from top doctors
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:34.780]   who are expert in the relevant areas.
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.420]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.940]   I learned that I had elevated levels
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:40.540]   of mercury in my blood.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.500]   Function not only helped me detect that,
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.020]   but offered insights into how best
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.540]   to reduce my mercury levels,
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.900]   which included limiting my tuna consumption,
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.340]   I'd been eating a lot of tuna,
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:51.540]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.900]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:55.940]   both of which can support glutathione production
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:57.380]   and detoxification.
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.900]   And I should say, by taking a second Function test,
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:00.940]   that approach worked.
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:03.420]   Comprehensive blood testing is vitally important.
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:04.820]   There's so many things related
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:06.440]   to your mental and physical health
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.940]   that can only be detected in a blood test.
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:10.140]   The problem is blood testing
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:12.380]   has always been very expensive and complicated.
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:14.140]   In contrast, I've been super impressed
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:17.340]   by Function's simplicity and at the level of cost.
[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:18.660]   It is very affordable.
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:19.480]   As a consequence,
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.780]   I decided to join their scientific advisory board,
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:24.460]   and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:25.800]   If you'd like to try Function,
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.740]   you can go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:31.860]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.980]   but they're offering early access
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.700]   to Huberman podcast listeners.
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:38.940]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:41.260]   to get early access to Function.
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:43.260]   - What is so striking to me is that,
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:46.660]   and Martha taught me this practice of,
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:48.180]   when we think about the things
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:53.180]   that create shame for ourselves,
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:55.360]   if we're able to go up and really look at those
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:58.900]   and own them not from the perspective of I'm proud of them,
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:03.480]   but own them as in us and not of us,
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:08.260]   that it's incredibly freeing.
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.180]   And indeed it is so freeing, right?
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:13.920]   It's like the, if there were like a secret to life,
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.900]   it would at least include that.
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.380]   - Yeah.
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:20.220]   - Because--
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:22.020]   - Let me wrap up on that for a second.
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:22.860]   - Yeah, please.
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:24.740]   - 'Cause just as an example,
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:29.740]   like I do, I've done workshops
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:32.540]   where I have people work with their racism.
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:35.100]   You're speaking of something very shameful.
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:38.980]   And a lot of people say, "I don't, I'm not a racist.
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:40.420]   "I don't have any racism."
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:45.420]   But if I really convince them to look inside and check,
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:46.940]   they'll find there's a little part in there
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.520]   that does spout racist things
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.420]   when they meet somebody of a different skin color,
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:54.000]   has these white supremacy beliefs,
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.500]   and they're really ashamed of it.
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.020]   So if I were to have you focus
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.940]   on that racist voice in there,
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:03.260]   you would have to get a lot of the parts
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:05.220]   that are ashamed of it to step out.
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.660]   And then I would have you get curious about it
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:09.740]   rather than ashamed of it,
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:14.420]   and ask it about where it picked up these beliefs.
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:15.580]   And it could tell you.
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:18.700]   And then I would ask,
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:21.860]   "Do you like having to carry this racist stuff?"
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.020]   Usually they'll say no.
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:26.980]   If it's ready to unload it, we can just unload it.
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:30.660]   So one of the key things to know is
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:33.120]   these parts are not the burdens they carry.
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.580]   They're all good.
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:38.140]   The little guy who's got the racist rant
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:42.820]   is a part that got stuck with his beliefs.
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:44.760]   But when he releases those beliefs,
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:47.300]   he transforms into being a good.
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:50.000]   And the mistake our culture makes,
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.240]   the mistake that most psychotherapists make,
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:58.340]   is to assume that he is that racist rant,
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.780]   and to try to exile him.
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:03.580]   But it's a different way of understanding
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:06.700]   even very seemingly evil people,
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:09.580]   that they're dominated by these protectors,
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:12.100]   and they're so afraid of their exiles.
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.540]   And they relate inside
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:17.040]   in the same way they relate outside.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.540]   So if they hate parts of themselves,
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:22.500]   they'll hate people who resemble those parts of them.
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:25.220]   They'll try to dominate those people.
[01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:26.180]   Do you follow what I'm saying?
[01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:28.740]   - Yeah, and I'd like to really go into this a bit,
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:31.860]   because we hear all the time
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.580]   that when we're upset about something,
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:36.920]   it's something in ourselves that we're really upset about.
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:40.880]   - And for me, that isn't always true,
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:43.020]   but that's sometimes true, yeah.
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:45.880]   - So if I'm upset about the intolerance
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.620]   of good ideas from people in opposite groups
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:52.240]   of each other's good ideas,
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:19:00.300]   this logic would say that I'm really just disapproving
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:01.940]   of that aspect of myself
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:05.780]   that is like black and white judgmental.
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:08.180]   - Which we already established.
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.100]   - Got me.
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:10.980]   Then again, you're the therapist, so.
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:16.620]   Right, so is this always true?
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:18.840]   - Not always, but a lot of the time.
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:23.300]   So if you can come to have compassion
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.700]   for that judgmental part of you,
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:26.960]   and not be embattled with it,
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.900]   and actually see it as desperately trying to help you,
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:33.060]   be more discerning, and help it unburden
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.180]   and get out of this role that it's in.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:38.100]   'Cause in the role that it's in, it can be destructive.
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:40.060]   We're not trying to minimize that or say,
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:43.760]   you know, when I say all parts, there are no bad parts,
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:44.600]   there are no bad parts,
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:47.380]   but they can get into very destructive roles,
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:50.140]   and they can carry these burdens from the past
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:53.100]   that can drive them to be harmful.
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:58.540]   But part of my work is to help all that change,
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:03.140]   and so if you were to start a new relationship
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:04.960]   with that judgmental part of you,
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:08.500]   then you would see past the judgmental parts
[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:12.340]   of other people, and you could see the exiles
[01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:14.780]   that drive those protectors,
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:16.980]   and you would have compassion for them.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:19.740]   It wouldn't mean you wouldn't stop them
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:24.620]   or stand up to them, but you would do it with compassion,
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:27.640]   rather than from these hateful protectors.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.960]   - Ah.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.320]   - I think it's important that people hear that.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:37.240]   Namely, that if we get in touch with these parts
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.180]   of ourselves that are protectors,
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:45.560]   that it makes us less vulnerable, not more vulnerable,
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:47.480]   both to, quote-unquote, attack,
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:50.940]   but that also, I guess, put simply,
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:54.540]   that in understanding of ourselves
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:56.120]   and compassion for ourselves,
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.260]   one develops understanding and compassion for others,
[01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:02.160]   but that doesn't mean that you're opening yourself up
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:03.000]   for harm.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:03.840]   - That's right.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.240]   - And the opposite is actually true.
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.920]   - The opposite is actually true,
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:10.880]   'cause these protectors will generate often what they fear.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:15.880]   So by being so protective, they'll create protectors
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.280]   in the other that will attack,
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:21.080]   whereas if they could stay in self,
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:25.220]   self can be very protective with those C-word qualities.
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.860]   Very forceful, sometimes fierce.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:33.120]   - This idea of, I'm definitely following,
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:38.120]   that we will sometimes create in others what we fear,
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:44.160]   because it allows us to engage in this unhealthy dynamic.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.000]   It seems so counterintuitive, right?
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.360]   Maybe we take a kind of classic set of examples
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.560]   that I think are pretty common.
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.360]   A person who's codependent with somebody
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.400]   who's a substance abuse addict,
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:02.440]   or somebody who's very timid and always wants to pacify,
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.400]   and somebody who's very dominant.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.620]   When I zoom out from the second case,
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:09.840]   it actually makes me chuckle how crazy that is,
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.920]   because if you think about it,
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.680]   a person who is very dominant
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:18.840]   doesn't need somebody very timid
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.600]   in order to feel dominant, right?
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:24.520]   They could probably feel whatever power it is
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:26.440]   they need to feel with somebody who is less timid,
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.880]   and maybe the relationship would be healthier,
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:31.240]   but that's not how people tend to other select.
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:32.280]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:35.280]   So it raises perhaps a bigger question.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.840]   Why do people select people
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:41.280]   that are fundamentally bad for them?
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.440]   - Okay, so I did a book called
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:46.960]   "You're the One You've Been Waiting For,"
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.840]   and in it, I talked about this whole issue,
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.660]   and so for a lot of people,
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:56.620]   you get hurt by your parent,
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:23:02.200]   and there are parts that wanna protect you from your parent,
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.160]   but there are other parts who are desperate,
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:05.520]   who took on the worthlessness
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:08.080]   from being rejected by your parent,
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.280]   and are desperate for redemption.
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.200]   Do you follow this?
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:17.100]   And so as you leave and you're looking for a partner,
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.960]   that part from a subconscious place
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.520]   can influence your decision
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:26.880]   to find somebody who resembles that parent
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.480]   in their effort to be redeemed again.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.920]   - Yeah, is this anything like
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.120]   the sort of repetition compulsion?
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.160]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:37.200]   - That we tend to repeat a pattern over and over again
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:39.040]   as an attempt to resolve,
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:42.800]   not just a manifestation of dysfunction?
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.320]   - That's a version of what I'm talking about.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.240]   And so you find somebody who does resemble that person,
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.600]   that parent, and unfortunately,
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.600]   they do resemble that parent,
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:55.180]   and so they'll hurt you in the same way,
[01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:59.160]   and then your protectors go into one of four modes.
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:02.760]   They'll say, "I've gotta change that person back
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.000]   "into who they're supposed to be,"
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.360]   so they'll try to change the person's behavior,
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:11.100]   or they'll say, "I've gotta change myself
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:14.240]   "so they'll be who they're supposed to be,"
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:18.360]   or they'll say, "Oh, this wasn't the redeemer after all,"
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:19.240]   and they'll go looking
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:21.440]   for the real redeemer who's still out there.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.040]   - And it's always inside.
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:25.760]   - And yeah, that's what I try to do,
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:28.080]   is to help them see that that redeemer
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.440]   is inside of them itself.
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.720]   And if we can go to that exile
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:37.440]   who's got this thing for this parent-like person
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:42.440]   and help it connect to self and help it unburden,
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.320]   that whole repetition compulsion disappears,
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.720]   'cause now they can take care of themselves.
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:51.440]   They trust self to do it.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.520]   They don't need that from some other person like that.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:58.240]   And so, when we're working with couples,
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:02.240]   and you always find some version of that in couples,
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:03.840]   if we can get each of them to become
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:08.340]   their own good attachment figure, good caretaker inside,
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:11.320]   that frees up the partner,
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:16.200]   because when this exile is leading the relationship,
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:20.160]   your partner feels a lot of sort of demands,
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.200]   or feels a lot like your partner
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.880]   has to take care of that young part of you,
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.520]   and can't, can't fully do it.
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:31.240]   So there's always this sense of, oh, a burden.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.240]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.600]   It's so interesting how romantic relationships
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.600]   are where these patterns get repeated.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.560]   And at the same time, numerous examples in my life
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:45.360]   of healthy relationships,
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.360]   is that usually the case
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:49.440]   because people have done the work before,
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:52.880]   or because they had a minimum of trauma in their upbringing?
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:53.720]   - Both, yeah.
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:54.540]   - Yeah.
[01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:59.440]   What percentage of kids, adults as well,
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:01.960]   do you think had a minimum of trauma,
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.060]   are just because of the way they're wired,
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:07.000]   and the way the stuff is organized within them,
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000]   that they naturally attach to a good partner,
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.480]   and are pretty healthy?
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:15.080]   Is it like 25%, 30%?
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.040]   Does it?
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:19.680]   - I really can't say, 'cause I, my sample is very skewed.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:22.760]   I'm working with psychotherapy patients
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.320]   who always have a lot of trauma.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:27.440]   So I really can't say.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:30.480]   I mean, I'm very biased.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.780]   - Well, half of marriages in this country end in divorce.
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:39.080]   And presumably of the ones that don't,
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:42.000]   I'm guessing somewhere between a half
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.080]   and a quarter of those,
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:50.360]   people are really unhappy.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:51.400]   Sounds so pessimistic.
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.120]   But if you just look at the numbers,
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:54.240]   and I'm an optimist,
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.200]   I already acknowledge
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:56.840]   that I don't like to think about bad stuff,
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.420]   and I, you know, so.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:02.960]   Yeah, I'm guessing that a lot of people
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.640]   repeat these patterns,
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:09.920]   but it seemed as if maybe 20, 30 years ago,
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:12.800]   because these ideas weren't discussed really,
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:17.320]   so many fewer people were in any kind of analysis
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:20.340]   or personal exploration work,
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:23.040]   that as a society,
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.540]   we defaulted to just sort of role execution.
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:29.680]   You're a father and a husband,
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:30.960]   so you do certain things,
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.360]   and you don't do certain things.
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.760]   You're a wife and a mother,
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:34.600]   so you do certain things,
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.360]   and you don't do certain, and so on.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:40.600]   And I think nowadays there's a lot of discussion about,
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:45.280]   you know, is there a resurgence of organized religion
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.160]   because we've drifted so far
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:49.020]   from these kind of core structures?
[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:52.400]   I mean, love your thoughts on that.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.280]   And also what you think,
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:57.000]   doing this kind of internal work on oneself
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.860]   without requiring any input or participation from another,
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:02.320]   what the value of that is.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.620]   It sounds like there's tremendous value
[01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:07.080]   to just doing this work for oneself,
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.600]   maybe with someone trained in IFS.
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:13.000]   - Yeah, I mean, like I was saying,
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.880]   there's a lot you can do with working with your protectors
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:18.920]   and helping them get to know self.
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.000]   Like, we didn't do it,
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   but had you asked that titanium teddy bear
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.880]   how old it thought you were
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.880]   and just really waited for the answer,
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.760]   most people will get a single digit.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:36.920]   It still thinks you're very young,
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.440]   and it still thinks it has to protect you
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.100]   the way it did when you were very young.
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:43.640]   And just even updating it
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:48.920]   creates a huge amount of relief with these protectors.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.400]   So there's a lot that can be done
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.400]   just by working with protectors,
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.320]   introducing them to self,
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.600]   helping them see they don't have to keep doing this
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:57.440]   all the time.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.360]   Some protectors, it's very hard for them
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.800]   to totally drop their weapons
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.000]   until what they protect has been healed.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.560]   So that's where the therapist comes in.
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:14.560]   So, you know, there are coaches doing this work, for example.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:20.280]   They'll work with some executive and they'll do great,
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.760]   and then they'll get to an exile.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.280]   And then they'll have the person see an IFS therapist
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.560]   for a couple of sessions to heal the exile
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.700]   and then come back.
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:33.640]   'Cause, you know, coaches aren't trained as therapists.
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:34.740]   - Right.
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:38.980]   - So yeah, there's still need for therapists,
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:43.980]   but yeah, but you can do a lot on your own.
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.260]   - I'm struck by how experiential it is
[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:50.300]   as opposed to just conceptual.
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.100]   I mean, obviously the concepts are important,
[01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:55.220]   but I think internal family systems
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:58.260]   was described for me previously,
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:00.020]   kind of mapped out for me on paper.
[01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:03.180]   I got a sense of it actually with some objects placed out
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:05.500]   and it was helpful,
[01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:10.500]   but I think just having done a little bit of it today,
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:15.180]   the only by actually feeling the sensations in the body
[01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:18.060]   associated with it does actually really make sense to me.
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:19.340]   I mean, it made sense cognitively,
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:21.220]   but that's so very different.
[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:22.060]   - It's very removed.
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:23.380]   - Yeah, it's like me telling people, you know,
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:25.060]   get out and get sunlight in your eyes in the morning
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:26.180]   or set your circadian rhythm.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:27.100]   Like you can know that,
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:28.620]   you can know the underlying mechanisms,
[01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:30.860]   the neurons, the pathways, the hormones, et cetera,
[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:34.700]   but at some level until you experience what that's like
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:37.100]   for two or three days in a row,
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:41.780]   you might as well be reading about, I don't know,
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:44.460]   titanium teddy bears, you know, yeah.
[01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:46.260]   - Exactly, and that's why I'm so grateful to you
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:48.340]   that you were willing to try it.
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:51.420]   And because it's true, as I describe it to people,
[01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:54.860]   they don't really get it until they actually feel it,
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:57.580]   experience it, and it is very different
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:58.820]   from many other therapies,
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:02.700]   which are much more cognitively based,
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.740]   'cause we're trying to bypass that
[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:08.300]   and actually get to this raw stuff in here.
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:10.180]   - In order to be deliberately repetitive,
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:15.140]   I wonder if it would be useful to the listeners to,
[01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:19.900]   would it be possible to just pose the questions to them
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:22.140]   as an exercise that they could do in real time?
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:23.140]   - Totally, yeah.
[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:24.460]   - Thank you so much.
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:26.300]   - I think that would be tremendously valuable.
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:29.100]   So I'm gonna have to erase myself here.
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.540]   For once, I'm gonna be quiet for a little while, folks,
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:35.180]   and you are the lucky patient
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:40.260]   that gets to talk to Dr. Schwartz here,
[01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:43.020]   and he's gonna pose a series of questions,
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:46.980]   and we'll allow some moments of break or silence
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:48.980]   for you to be able to tap into the answers
[01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:50.420]   to these in real time.
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:52.940]   That way, you don't have to create
[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:56.180]   a parallel construction of what we did earlier.
[01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:59.220]   - Yeah, and let me lead by saying,
[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:02.060]   please don't do this if you have fear about doing it.
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:08.780]   But if you're interested in some inner exploration,
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:13.220]   then I'll lead you through some of the steps.
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:18.220]   So as you've been listening to our conversation,
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.580]   I'm speaking to listeners,
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:23.460]   you may be thinking about some of your own parts,
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:25.900]   particularly your own protectors.
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:28.500]   And if you can't think of any,
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:30.820]   most people have a kind of critic inside
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:33.580]   or part that makes them work too hard
[01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:38.100]   or a part that takes care of too many people.
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:44.260]   So I'm gonna invite you to pick a protective part
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:46.700]   to try to get to know for a few minutes.
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:52.820]   And just notice that inner voice
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:58.740]   or that emotion, that thought pattern,
[01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:03.740]   that sensation, just focus on it exclusively for a second.
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:06.900]   And as you do that,
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:11.020]   notice where it seems to be located
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:12.980]   in your body or around your body.
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:16.380]   And just take a second with that.
[01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:19.700]   And some people don't find a location,
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:21.420]   some people they still sense it,
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:24.580]   but it's not clear where it seems to be located.
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:29.020]   But if you do find it in or around your body,
[01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:32.340]   just focus on it there.
[01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:45.460]   And as you focus on it,
[01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:47.900]   notice how you feel toward it.
[01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:50.580]   And by that I mean,
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:54.860]   do you dislike it and wanna get rid of it?
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:58.700]   Are you afraid of it?
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:05.180]   Do you resent how it dominates?
[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:09.020]   Do you depend on it?
[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:14.140]   So you have a relationship with this part of you.
[01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:17.300]   (silence)
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:26.100]   And if you feel anything except a kind of openness
[01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:28.700]   or curiosity or willingness to get to know it,
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:32.780]   then that's coming from other parts
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:35.820]   that have been trying to deal with it.
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:40.380]   And we're just gonna ask those other parts of you
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:44.260]   to relax back for just a few minutes
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:47.580]   so you can get to know it.
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:50.420]   We're not gonna have it take over more.
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:53.580]   We're just gonna get to know it better.
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:59.180]   So see if they're willing to let you open your mind to it.
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:05.260]   And if they're not, then we're not gonna pursue this.
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:08.140]   And you can just get to know their fear
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:10.700]   about letting you get to know this target part.
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:13.620]   (silence)
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:17.740]   But if you do get to that point
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:22.380]   of just being curious about it without an agenda,
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:27.100]   then ask it what it wants you to know about itself.
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:31.340]   Just a kind of nice open-ended question.
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:33.940]   And don't think of the answer,
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:36.940]   just wait and see what comes from that place in your body.
[01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:42.580]   And don't judge what comes, just whatever comes,
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:43.540]   we'll go with it.
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:48.620]   What does it want you to know about itself?
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:53.140]   And what's it afraid would happen
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:55.120]   if it didn't do this inside of you?
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:08.620]   And if you got an answer to that question about the fear,
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:11.660]   then it was telling you something
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:13.760]   about how it's been trying to protect you.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:21.820]   And if that's true, then extend some appreciation to it
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:25.380]   for at least trying to keep you safe,
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:27.700]   even if it backfires or it doesn't work.
[01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:32.620]   Let it know you appreciate that it's trying to protect you.
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:37.060]   And see how it reacts to your appreciation.
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:40.380]   (mouse clicking)
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:48.740]   And then ask if you could go to what it protects
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:52.540]   and heal or change that
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:56.500]   so it didn't need to protect you so much.
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:00.420]   What might it like to do instead inside of you
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:02.200]   if it was released from this role?
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.800]   And I'll repeat that.
[01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:08.900]   If you could go to what it protects
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:10.500]   and heal or change that
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:14.060]   so it was liberated from this protective role,
[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:17.700]   what might it like to do instead inside of you?
[01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:33.140]   And then ask it this kind of odd question.
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:35.800]   How old does this part think you are?
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:40.160]   Not how old is it, but how old does it think you are?
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:44.340]   And again, don't think, just wait and see what comes.
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:38:01.880]   And if it got your age wrong,
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:06.480]   then go ahead and update it and see how it reacts.
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:28.120]   And the last question for this part is
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:31.200]   what does it need from you going forward?
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:34.440]   What does it need from you?
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:39.200]   And again, just wait for the answer.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:56.920]   And when the time feels right,
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:59.680]   thank your parts for whatever they let you do in this
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:03.500]   and then begin to shift your focus back outside
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:06.800]   and maybe take some deep breaths as you do that.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:15.580]   - Thank you for that.
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:16.800]   That was awesome.
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:20.520]   I also was able to get some, I think, good work done in that.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:22.280]   - Is that true? - Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.160]   Totally different location,
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:26.920]   totally different set of dynamics.
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:32.920]   So, even though what you just took us through
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:35.480]   is very experiential,
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:39.820]   what, if any, value do you think there is to writing down
[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:42.120]   sort of key takeaways? - A lot of value, yeah.
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:46.440]   Yeah, so it's great to do the work session
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.920]   or this exercise,
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:52.080]   but ideally it's the beginning
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.640]   of a new relationship with this part.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:58.240]   So, and that takes work on your own.
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:00.600]   So, what I advise people is,
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.760]   as you get that ball rolling in that good direction,
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:07.880]   it'll reverse if you don't stay with it for a while.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.760]   So, every day, like you were saying,
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:14.160]   you wake up, rather than what am I gonna do today
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.320]   or what problems do I have in my life,
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.520]   how's that part of me doing
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:20.360]   that I've been starting to work with?
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:23.400]   What does it need from me today?
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.520]   What does it want me to know?
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.180]   Is it still feeling better?
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:32.560]   Do I still have compassion for it or appreciation for it?
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.160]   So, like I said earlier,
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.280]   this kind of becomes a life practice.
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:42.240]   So, I do that every morning. - Every morning?
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:43.720]   - Not every, not every.
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:46.000]   - Well, you're very familiar with these parts.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.920]   And to clarify for people,
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.360]   when Dr. Schwartz is saying parts,
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:55.440]   he's saying these personalities within us,
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:58.440]   not necessarily the body part where it manifests,
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:01.680]   but maybe that provides a physical anchor to look to.
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:03.360]   - Exactly right.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:06.420]   So, yeah, I'll check in,
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:10.160]   not with all my parts, 'cause I've met many, many,
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:11.800]   but the ones I've been working with,
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:14.840]   just to see how they're doing.
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:16.340]   And as I go through the day,
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:20.720]   I'll notice, am I in those C-word qualities?
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:22.240]   Is my heart open?
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:25.200]   Is my mind curious?
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:26.520]   Do I have a big agenda?
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:33.080]   Anything, any departures from that is a protector, usually.
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:35.800]   And I'll just have a little internal board meeting.
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.640]   I get, you feel like,
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:41.280]   like in preparing to come and be on this podcast,
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.600]   I had to work with the parts that were nervous,
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:47.720]   and I have, my father was a big scientist,
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:50.920]   big endocrinology researcher.
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.680]   - Oh, cool, great field.
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:53.640]   - Great field.
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:56.860]   My brother is a big shot endocrinology researcher.
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:02.680]   So I have some issues, put it that way.
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:04.840]   - I hope I didn't reinforce the negative ones.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.800]   - Well, that was my parts' worries coming in,
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.440]   and so I worked on it and said,
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:13.920]   "Okay, but just, I get it, I get you're scared."
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:15.520]   I could feel them in my hands
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:17.560]   when I was taking a drink earlier.
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:18.640]   - Interesting.
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:21.400]   - But I just kept, "Okay, I get that.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.920]   "I get you're scared, but just trust me.
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:25.840]   "Just step back, just relax."
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:28.700]   And then I feel this shift, a literal shift,
[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:32.760]   and then I feel those C words flooding,
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:35.500]   and then we have a much different kind of conversation.
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:40.200]   So it's a life practice in that sense.
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:41.640]   - I love that, thanks for sharing that.
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:44.420]   I didn't detect any anxiety whatsoever,
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:50.520]   neither pre-recording nor during this discussion.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:54.000]   If you don't mind, could you describe
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.440]   or maybe even just list off some of the other labels
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:01.760]   of parts that people might encounter
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:02.980]   if they do this kind of work?
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:07.520]   So you described them as protectors that manage,
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:10.400]   and then the exiles, which are the parts of us
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:13.780]   that the protectors and managers are protecting, correct?
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:15.800]   Okay, those are two different things, right?
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:19.240]   - Yes, so yeah, the big distinction is between parts
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:24.240]   that by dint of simply being hurt or terrified
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:26.940]   or made to feel shamed and worthless,
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:31.680]   and usually those are our most sensitive parts.
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:33.360]   They're the young inner children.
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:38.060]   They get stuck with those burdens of worthlessness,
[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:40.400]   terror, and emotional pain,
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:43.140]   and then we don't want anything to do with them
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:45.060]   because they can overwhelm us,
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:46.140]   and so we lock them away,
[01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:47.920]   and everybody tells us to do that.
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.360]   So those are the exiles,
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:53.280]   and when you have a lot of exiles,
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:57.800]   these other parts are forced to become protectors.
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:00.520]   So there are two classes of protectors.
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:03.420]   One are the managers we've been talking about,
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:06.160]   and the other are the firefighters.
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:12.720]   So we mentioned a number of manager common roles,
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:15.460]   but there's just lots and lots of them.
[01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:20.900]   Firefighter common roles include addictions,
[01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:26.820]   excuse me, dissociating,
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:33.080]   the kind of judgmental, rageful parts.
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:41.580]   I could go on, but anything that is reactive, impulsive,
[01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:48.060]   and is designed to protect those vulnerable parts,
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:51.600]   but in an impulsive way,
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:53.600]   as opposed to the managers
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:58.120]   who are all about control and pleasing.
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:59.980]   These firefighters are all about,
[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:03.620]   if I don't get you away from these feelings right now,
[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:04.920]   you're gonna die.
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:06.260]   A lot of them believe that,
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:10.380]   and some of them, it's true.
[01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:14.780]   So there's often a kind of hierarchy
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:16.940]   of firefighter activities.
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:18.820]   The first one doesn't work, you go to the next one.
[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:22.260]   If that doesn't work, the top of the hierarchy
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:25.120]   for most people is suicide.
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:29.600]   If things get painful enough,
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:32.740]   there's this exit strategy.
[01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:35.140]   It's actually very comforting to lots of people,
[01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:39.380]   and here we come along and get really scared
[01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:40.860]   of these suicidal parts.
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.740]   So this is, again, it's one of the hallmarks
[01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:46.020]   of the difference with IFS.
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:48.300]   If you were to say you've got a suicidal part,
[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:50.420]   say, "Let's go get to know it."
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:54.340]   I would have you find it and all the steps,
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:55.820]   and I would have you, "What are you afraid would happen
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:57.260]   "if you didn't kill Andrew?"
[01:45:57.260 --> 01:46:01.000]   What do you think the answer to that is most of the time?
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.500]   - That it would just feel like too much to bear.
[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:04.820]   - Yeah.
[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:06.660]   - Like they just couldn't take it anymore.
[01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:07.500]   - Exactly.
[01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:08.340]   - Which, of course, is a crazy statement,
[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:10.660]   'cause it's not like my brain would explode.
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:12.180]   But these parts believe it.
[01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:15.180]   - Yeah, yeah, they're not grounded in logic.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:17.940]   - So my, well, my response to that part
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:21.460]   is if we could unload the pain
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:24.020]   that you're so afraid would overwhelm,
[01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:26.780]   would you have to kill him?
[01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:28.140]   - No.
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:30.340]   - And would you let us do that?
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:33.580]   - Well, fortunately, I don't feel suicidal,
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:37.100]   but the answer would be yes.
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:39.060]   - Okay, so, 'cause we can prove to you
[01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:42.140]   that we can unload that pain,
[01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:45.300]   and if we could do that, what would you like to do
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:47.060]   instead of being the suicidal part?
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:53.900]   - I mean, I have to imagine that if somebody,
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:55.380]   forgive me for going into my head about this,
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:57.540]   but if I have to imagine, 'cause it's just hard for me
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:59.020]   to imagine being suicidal.
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:46:59.860]   - No, that's okay.
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:01.100]   - Yeah, but if I have to imagine
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:03.100]   that if somebody is feeling suicidal
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:05.020]   in order to protect themselves
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:08.580]   against the enormity of the feelings
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:10.420]   that they would otherwise feel,
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:13.260]   and then they are offered the opportunity
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:15.820]   to work through, to be released from those feelings,
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:20.100]   I think the scary part would be like the first,
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.280]   it's like wading into really cold water.
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:25.180]   You know, I always feel that way about negative feelings.
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:28.180]   Once you get past your kind of waist or so,
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:30.340]   you get your shoulders under.
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:31.180]   - That's a good analogy.
[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:32.700]   - It's a heck of a lot easier.
[01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:34.060]   - It's a really nice analogy, yeah.
[01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:37.200]   - Because you realize there's an upper limit to this stuff,
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:41.260]   and you passed it a little while ago, yeah.
[01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:46.260]   - Yeah, so that suicidal part often transforms
[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:50.740]   into part that wants to help you live, actually.
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:52.420]   They're often in the role that's opposite
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:53.580]   of who they really are.
[01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:57.260]   So as you can hear, this is a totally different approach
[01:47:57.260 --> 01:47:59.460]   to suicide, for example.
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:01.860]   And we do the same with addictive firefighters.
[01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:05.380]   Find that part that makes you so high.
[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:07.840]   How do you feel toward, I hate it.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.040]   I want to, you know, I want to be in recovery.
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:12.980]   I want to just lock it up.
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:16.680]   Let's get all that to step out and just get curious about
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:19.440]   and ask it what it's afraid would happen
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:22.280]   if it didn't get you high all the time.
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:23.120]   Same answer.
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:28.080]   If we could heal all that pain or that shame,
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:29.440]   would you have to get them high all the time?
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:31.440]   No, but I don't think you can do that.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.440]   Would you give us a chance to prove we can?
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.080]   Totally different approach to all these problems.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:41.200]   - Something comes to mind, for a number of years,
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:46.100]   not now, fortunately, I mean, I still work a lot,
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:49.060]   but I work like, you know, I don't want to,
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:52.740]   well, I'll share the numbers, but it's not a goal
[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:54.140]   that no one should try and exceed this.
[01:48:54.140 --> 01:48:55.820]   I mean, there were times in graduate school
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:58.700]   where I, no joke, worked 80, 85 hours a week,
[01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:00.220]   slept under my desk.
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:02.940]   I lived in my office as a junior professor.
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:04.880]   My students can attest to that, I brushed my teeth.
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:07.600]   Not every night, but you know, if I had deadlines,
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:10.880]   it was just all in with mind, body, heart, everything.
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.600]   It's not healthy, right?
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:14.520]   And at some point I had to take a look at it
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:17.520]   because it's not conducive to a lot of things.
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:20.120]   It brings a lot, you can get a lot done.
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.720]   I won't lie, you can get a lot done.
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.660]   You can get a lot of degrees.
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:26.740]   You can get a lot of knowledge and you can accomplish a lot.
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:30.760]   But I decided to take a look at it, you know,
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:33.940]   like what would happen if I, I don't know,
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:37.580]   published five awesome papers in a year instead of 10
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:39.420]   or something like, you know, I just started looking at it
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:42.560]   and it just, it seems crazy now.
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:46.360]   But I remember the genuine fear of backing off.
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:50.060]   And I started to realize that I loved what I did,
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:53.420]   but that some of the work came from a desire
[01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:57.900]   to compete out other feelings.
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:59.380]   It's a form of dissociation.
[01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:00.580]   - Totally.
[01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:03.440]   - And then what happened was I was able to adjust my hours,
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:06.560]   really pick the projects that held the most meaning for me
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:08.160]   and then really savor them and enjoy them.
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:10.040]   And that's how I approached the podcast
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:11.080]   and other things I'm doing.
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:15.040]   So it was a tremendously useful exploration,
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.140]   but it was terrifying.
[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:19.800]   I didn't have to go to 12 Step for work addiction
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:20.640]   or anything.
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:22.340]   I mean, it wasn't at that level, but-
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:25.840]   - But you're giving an example of exactly what we do.
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:28.240]   We go to that workaholic part.
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:29.340]   What are you afraid would happen
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:31.420]   if you didn't do this to them?
[01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:33.180]   - Yeah, so what I came to, it's interesting,
[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:37.420]   was the, it was literally a fear of annihilation,
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:38.540]   of disappearing.
[01:50:38.540 --> 01:50:39.380]   And then I thought, well,
[01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:40.980]   then you parsed it a little bit further,
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:42.380]   disappearing to who?
[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:45.300]   It's not like there was an absence of positive feedback.
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:48.380]   So it wasn't actually to avoid disappearing
[01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:49.740]   from the outside world.
[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:52.700]   'Cause I'll tell you when you're working 80, 85 hours a week,
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:57.700]   you're already gone, you know, you just don't realize it.
[01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:03.700]   It was actually some way of avoiding this thing
[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:05.840]   that I've now come to really love.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:07.280]   I learned it from my bulldog.
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:12.200]   I used to have this assumption that slow is low,
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:15.240]   like to slow down is depressive.
[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:16.880]   I mean, now I love slowing down.
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:19.360]   And I did learn that from my bulldog.
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:22.000]   And a few people came into my life and their dogs as well.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.920]   And I learned like to really savor slow
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:29.700]   and not just so that I can bounce back into work,
[01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:34.700]   that too, admittedly, but also to just,
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:36.000]   and it came through.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.840]   I just would like your thoughts on this.
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:41.480]   I realized right as I would go into
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:43.440]   or come out of a meditation
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:45.120]   or what I call non-sleep deep rest,
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.240]   this kind of yoga nidra like deep relaxation thing
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:48.560]   that listeners of this podcast
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:50.620]   will be familiar with hearing about,
[01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:54.720]   that there's this really terrifying moment
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:57.720]   where I realized someday,
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:59.400]   assuming I'm awake when it happens,
[01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:01.300]   or it's not an accident,
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:03.300]   or I don't get involved in an accident,
[01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:06.500]   I'm gonna take my last breath.
[01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:09.400]   And it's absolutely terrifying, that concept.
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:11.360]   And I realized that the fear of disappearing
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:12.640]   is actually a fear of death.
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:16.080]   And what I was really afraid of was death.
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:17.580]   And I was using work.
[01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:20.760]   So it's a long way from like working 60 hours
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:23.080]   or 40 hours a week instead, or 30, whatever,
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:24.680]   but people choose as opposed to 85.
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:25.520]   But what I realized,
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:28.160]   what I was running from was the fear of my own mortality.
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:29.000]   - That's right.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.440]   - And I didn't have to use any substances to realize this.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:33.800]   I just had to keep peeling back the layers of like,
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:35.120]   what are you really afraid of?
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:38.320]   And now I come to the conclusion that most addiction,
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:40.760]   having talked to a lot of addicts with process addictions
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:43.180]   and substance addictions, et cetera,
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:46.000]   that deep down everyone, addict or no,
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.280]   is terrified of death.
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:50.200]   It's just that some people are in touch with that terror
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:51.600]   and have worked through it.
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:55.560]   - Well, you remember what I was saying earlier
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:58.640]   when we talked to these addict parts,
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:52:59.520]   what are you afraid would happen
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:01.280]   if you didn't make them high?
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:02.120]   He would die.
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:05.360]   So that's a really common answer.
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:07.760]   And basically what you just described
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:10.160]   is you were doing IFS without knowing it.
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:14.440]   Asking those questions, what are you really afraid of?
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:15.360]   What are you really afraid of?
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:19.080]   Till you get to the key answer.
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:21.800]   And then I don't know how you help that part
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:25.780]   that feared death, but somehow you helped it relax more.
[01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:30.080]   - Yeah, I think if I, for better or worse,
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:33.920]   if I see or experience something that scares me a lot,
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:40.840]   I have to explore the contours of it.
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:43.160]   That's been a dangerous part of my life
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:47.440]   and it's been a helpful part of my life too.
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:50.800]   You know, the ability to suppress one's reflex
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:53.600]   to avoid fear is such a complicated thing
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:57.040]   because on the one hand, it's necessary to navigate life.
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:59.320]   On the other hand, people always say,
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:00.960]   "What would you tell your younger self
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:03.080]   if you could tell your younger self anything?"
[01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:07.120]   And I would have said, "Psst, hey, dude, listen.
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:09.840]   You know, if something makes you anxious, get out of there."
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:11.800]   Because my reflex has always been
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:13.880]   that if something gives me anxiety,
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:15.760]   it's like, okay, here's a test of myself.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:17.240]   - I see, yeah. - I need to overcome it.
[01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:19.480]   - Okay, so that's another part of protecting.
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:22.760]   So in any case, some people are the opposite, you know.
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:27.540]   Yeah, I've tended to touch the hot stove three times
[01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:29.400]   when it should have been one trial learning
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:31.960]   and it hurt, excuse me, the first time.
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:32.800]   So, but that's just me.
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:34.080]   I mean, everyone's got these things,
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:36.320]   but what I'm discovering,
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:39.080]   certainly through what you're telling us today,
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:42.400]   but also the exploration of these things
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:46.520]   is that so much of life is structured,
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:48.880]   especially nowadays with the phone.
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:50.400]   Love the phone, love social media,
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:53.640]   but so much of life is structured
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:56.760]   to fill all the space between activities.
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:01.760]   And I do want your thoughts on what you see
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:06.560]   in terms of things that are active impediments
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:09.900]   to doing good work of the sorts of work
[01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:12.400]   that you're describing today, self-work.
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:15.840]   I would never ask, I guess, to be disparaging of the world
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:16.880]   just for its own sake,
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:20.420]   but I think people are now starting to develop an awareness
[01:55:20.420 --> 01:55:24.680]   of how certain technologies and lifestyle habits
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:27.920]   that are unique to the last five or 10 years
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.160]   are really exacerbating our problems
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:33.600]   as they relate to ourselves,
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:35.200]   not just interpersonal dynamics.
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:36.040]   - Very much, yeah.
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:38.320]   - And you seem to be thinking about the big picture a lot.
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:39.920]   So I'm curious what your thoughts are.
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:43.100]   - Yeah, so, you know, all these little machines we have
[01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:47.160]   and all the ways we have of never spending any time
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:49.100]   by ourselves or alone or thinking,
[01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:54.100]   just feed these protective parts, these distractors,
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:56:00.000]   and leave in the dust more and more these exiled parts.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:05.680]   So a lot of people's fear of not having something to do
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:08.840]   is because when they don't,
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:10.520]   or if they're not working in your case,
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:15.920]   then these exiled parts start to come forward.
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:18.400]   They're not being distracted from.
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:22.320]   In my case, I mentioned my father.
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:24.000]   I'm the oldest of six boys.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:24.840]   - Oh, wow.
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:27.840]   - I was supposed to be a physician like him
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:31.940]   and a researcher, and I was spared that fate
[01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:36.320]   because I had undiagnosed ADD and wasn't a good student.
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:40.840]   And three of my brothers were physician research types.
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:46.320]   But I was the oldest, so he was really hard on me
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:50.520]   in terms of lazy and worthless and so on.
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:54.960]   So I came out of my family with a lot of worthlessness.
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:59.960]   And actually the model wouldn't exist
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:03.200]   if I didn't have that because I had this part
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:04.400]   that had to prove him wrong
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:09.020]   and drive me not to the extent you're talking about
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:10.440]   or sleeping in the office or anything,
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:15.120]   but it would drive me to find this model
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:18.560]   and then take it in the face of a lot of attack
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:20.740]   to where it is now.
[01:57:20.740 --> 01:57:24.120]   And if I wasn't working on it,
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:26.100]   if I wasn't getting the accolades,
[01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:29.160]   then that worthlessness would crop up.
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:31.960]   And then I'd have other firefighters
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:33.960]   to try and deal with that.
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:40.320]   And I had not only the workaholic part,
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:43.120]   but I had a part that could close my heart
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:45.080]   and make me not care what people think
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:50.600]   because I was attacked by traditional psychiatry and so on.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:52.700]   - For developing internal family systems?
[01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:53.540]   - Yeah.
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:57.480]   I was humiliated at Grand Rounds a couple of times.
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:57:59.840]   I was in a department of psychiatry.
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:01.800]   - What is with the field of psychiatry?
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:02.640]   - That's a good question.
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:07.160]   So, point being that I was dominated
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:09.480]   as I developed this by these protectors
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:13.000]   and it got me through all that,
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.780]   but it didn't serve me as a leader of a community.
[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:19.000]   And I was lucky to have some students
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.160]   who would confront my parts
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:24.480]   and would just say, "You can't keep going on like this
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:27.760]   "if you're gonna be any use to us."
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.640]   And I listened and I went and worked
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:33.520]   with that worthlessness and now I don't have it.
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:37.080]   I don't have to work, it's just I feel free
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:39.520]   'cause I'm not so afraid of that bubbling up
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:40.940]   if I'm not distracted.
[01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:46.800]   And now we have more distractions than ever as we're saying.
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:49.760]   - Right, the pain point can potentially
[01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:52.080]   become the source of tremendous growth
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:55.520]   and value to the world based on what you've developed.
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.920]   Keep in mind, I learned about your work,
[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:03.480]   not just through Martha Beck, although Martha as well,
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:08.040]   but several incredibly talented psychologists,
[01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:10.720]   scholars in the field of research psychology
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:14.640]   and actually a psychiatrist as well.
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:16.800]   - Yeah, there are some good psychiatrists.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:18.200]   - Maybe I'll just share the,
[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:23.360]   so a psychiatrist that I think the world of said to me,
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:25.120]   I won't reveal who it is, but they said,
[01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:28.320]   "Do you know why there's so many lousy psychiatrists?"
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:29.780]   This isn't a joke actually,
[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:32.440]   even though it sounds like the setup for a joke.
[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:33.640]   I said, "No, why?"
[01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:36.600]   And they said, "Well, because if you're
[01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:41.600]   a cardiothoracic surgeon and like 30% of your patients die,
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:46.400]   you're considered a pretty terrible cardiothoracic surgeon.
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:48.160]   If you're a psychiatrist,
[01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:52.040]   unless your patients kill themselves on a frequent basis,
[01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:55.820]   you can have a pretty "successful career."
[01:59:55.820 --> 01:59:56.660]   - That's interesting.
[01:59:56.660 --> 01:59:59.460]   - And no one ever questions whether or not
[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:02.040]   you're good at your job or not.
[02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:06.120]   Because the field, A, has a dearth of tools,
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:08.280]   B, the kind of assumption is that
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:11.640]   a lot of things don't get better and on and on.
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:13.120]   And they listed off all these reasons
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:15.000]   why the field of psychiatry is so replete
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:19.960]   with what they described as lousy psychiatrists.
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:24.080]   So I do believe there are some excellent psychiatrists
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:26.320]   out there, research and clinical and both.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.960]   I don't know if that does anything.
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:30.440]   It sounds like you worked through your relationship
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:31.880]   to psychiatrists on your own.
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:33.880]   You don't need my statements.
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:35.860]   - I agree with you entirely, yeah.
[02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:40.200]   And I tried to stay in psychiatry
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:42.400]   and just kept hitting the brick wall.
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:45.740]   And so I went grassroots for 30 years
[02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:48.800]   and now it's starting to come around into psychiatry.
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:51.080]   So it feels good that way.
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:54.560]   - It's interesting how timing in a field is so important
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:55.840]   and not just an academic field,
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:58.800]   but a clinical field and the ethos.
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:03.400]   If anyone is interested in understanding
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:07.280]   where we are in the arc of medicine and culture,
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:12.280]   I highly recommend reading Oliver Sacks' book, "On the Move."
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:15.120]   He was an obviously neurologist and writer,
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:17.720]   but he describes coming up through medicine
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:20.320]   and being in these various fields.
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:22.960]   He worked on headache for a while.
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:24.280]   It's pretty interesting.
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:25.920]   He wrote a book about migraine.
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:30.920]   He worked with kids on the autism spectrum
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:32.700]   and a bunch of different fields.
[02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:35.560]   And in every single one of those fields
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:40.160]   was vehemently attacked by some individual
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:42.600]   for whatever reason, usually a superior,
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:44.760]   kicked out of universities, moved to another one.
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:45.960]   Now he did have his own issues.
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:48.840]   He was, you know, at the time he was a methamphetamine addict
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:50.120]   and things like that, but he got over that
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:53.560]   and became the great Oliver Sacks that he was.
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:55.720]   But, you know, he describes these fields
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:57.720]   as having a culture at the time
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:00.020]   of really trying to suppress new ideas
[02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:01.280]   and holding people down.
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.320]   And then toward the end of his career,
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:04.940]   several of the universities
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:07.320]   that essentially had fired him earlier,
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:08.760]   hospitals and universities,
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:13.200]   were trying to recruit him back with multiple appointments
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:15.040]   because now he was this famous guy
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:17.640]   who had written a movie or worked on the movie "Awakenings"
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:19.080]   and like, you know, and of course,
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:23.280]   it revealed the hypocrisy of these big institutions.
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:25.400]   And so it made me chuckle and also realize
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:28.000]   that for those of us who are doing public health education
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.160]   at any level, and certainly on the,
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:35.160]   these more non-traditional things, approaches,
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:37.880]   that the time is right for sharing them.
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:41.280]   And the good news is nobody lives forever.
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:44.680]   So, you know, the old guard dies or retires, you know.
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:45.520]   - That's true.
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:47.040]   And I'm not going to hold my breath
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:50.040]   waiting for that Department of Psychiatry to invite me back.
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:53.600]   - I won't ask which one it was.
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:55.440]   We can have an offline discussion about that.
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:56.320]   They just might.
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:03:00.180]   A couple of more questions.
[02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:05.000]   First of all, going back to this thing
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.780]   about the larger context of culture,
[02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:13.000]   I love the optimism that's threaded through your view
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.760]   that we could get, God willing,
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:19.840]   Democrats and Republicans to come to some sort
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:24.100]   of common ground around the most important issues,
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:30.640]   that we potentially could eradicate destructive racism,
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:32.060]   racism of all kinds.
[02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:34.840]   But given the way you described it,
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:37.840]   certainly it's implementation in the world
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:40.540]   is the first thing that needs to be dealt with, right?
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:45.080]   Certainly, if people can see those parts of themselves
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:49.720]   and work with them, that we stand a chance to do that.
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:54.520]   And given that trauma is near ubiquitous, right?
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:57.760]   That people could start to address their own traumas
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:00.640]   so that they can induce fewer in other people.
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:05.000]   I guess that's basically the ultimate goal of humanity.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:05.840]   - Totally.
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:10.440]   - And I, like so many people,
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:14.520]   lately, not just, by the way,
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:15.860]   not just in the last year or so,
[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:17.700]   but like for the last 10 years,
[02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:20.160]   have just been developing the sense like, goodness,
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:22.440]   like it just seems like the number of problems
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:25.220]   is just seems to be expanding exponentially.
[02:04:25.220 --> 02:04:27.280]   How do we get our heads around this?
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:29.600]   And, you know, there's so much blame game going on,
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:31.680]   of, well, it's because of this, and it's because of that.
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:34.280]   And like, that's not a solution at all.
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:38.300]   So I love your sense of optimism that it's possible.
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:41.200]   And then my question is,
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:47.240]   how do we get that going to be direct?
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:49.920]   - Yeah, well, that's what I've been working on
[02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:52.200]   the last several years.
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:57.200]   And what I can say is, for example, I spent 20 years,
[02:04:57.200 --> 02:05:00.480]   like, you know, I worked with bulimia, like I said,
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:05.040]   and I thought, okay, this really works with that population.
[02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:07.280]   - You got people who were bulimic
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:09.200]   to essentially not be bulimic any longer.
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:10.720]   - Yeah. - Wow.
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:14.640]   - And then I thought, okay,
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:18.100]   well, let's see if no bad parts is really true.
[02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:22.280]   And so I went to the toughest populations I could find.
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:25.120]   So for 20 years, I worked with DID and I worked with-
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:27.120]   - DID, sorry.
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:29.480]   - Dissociative identity disorder,
[02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:32.120]   like multiple personality disorder.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:33.840]   And I worked with
[02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:36.840]   what's called borderline personality clients.
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:38.040]   - Yeah, very common, right?
[02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:38.880]   - Yeah.
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:39.840]   - Before, when you talked about bulimia,
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:44.560]   bulimia is notoriously difficult to treat, let alone cure.
[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:46.720]   - It's because people fight with the symptoms.
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:48.060]   They try to get rid of the symptoms
[02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:51.640]   instead of listening to the part that's making them binge
[02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:53.480]   about what that's about.
[02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:56.120]   - Moving from the one-on-one therapy model
[02:05:56.120 --> 02:05:59.000]   to a model where people can do this work on their own
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.840]   as well as in groups.
[02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:04.900]   But if I'm correct in thinking this,
[02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:08.240]   it seems like getting the work done with oneself
[02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:09.960]   is the first real step.
[02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:10.800]   - Yeah.
[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:12.480]   - That there's no replacement for that.
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:13.320]   - Yeah.
[02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:14.160]   - Yeah.
[02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:16.500]   - And there's, in the activist world,
[02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:18.000]   there's always been a kind of,
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.920]   you're wasting, I'm wasting your time,
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:25.760]   but there's been a polarization
[02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:30.760]   between being in the activist mindset
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:34.640]   of really trying to change things in the outside world,
[02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:39.360]   versus sitting around and just focusing inside
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:40.640]   and not being an activist.
[02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:44.960]   But I'm working with a lot of the peoples
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:48.160]   you would recognize in terms of activists.
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:52.160]   And when they came to me, they were doing their activism
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:54.800]   from this sort of righteous, judgmental part.
[02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:59.060]   And if we can get that one to step back
[02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:03.180]   and have them do their activism from self,
[02:07:03.180 --> 02:07:05.520]   they have a totally different impact.
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:08.200]   People are willing to listen to them,
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:10.080]   whereas when they're in that righteous place,
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:13.660]   nobody wants to listen to the shaming that does.
[02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:15.400]   It needs to be both.
[02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:20.240]   People need to do their work, access self,
[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:22.640]   and then start to try to change the outside world,
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:26.740]   or not one before the other, but at least simultaneously.
[02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:29.420]   - Fantastic.
[02:07:29.420 --> 02:07:31.840]   No, really fantastic.
[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:36.360]   I don't think we've ever done a podcast like this
[02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:40.540]   where the audience had a chance
[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:43.100]   to do self-work in real time.
[02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:46.740]   - Really appreciate you giving me the opportunity.
[02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:49.380]   - Yeah, I don't know that I've ever heard a discussion
[02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:52.420]   like it, to be honest,
[02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:57.420]   which is just a testament to you and your bravery.
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:02.280]   It's very clear that your decision
[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:03.680]   not to go into endocrinology
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:06.400]   was one that we all are grateful for.
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:07.400]   - It wasn't a decision.
[02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:09.560]   - Well, my endocrinologist friends
[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:12.640]   will have to just accept that, you know,
[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:14.360]   we've got a lot of good endocrinologists.
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:16.840]   We needed you, Dr. Dick Schwartz,
[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:21.840]   to find yourself in this business of discovering
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:30.000]   and creating a truly novel approach to therapy
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.260]   and self-work that goes all the way up
[02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:37.820]   to the potential to change culture, change the world.
[02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:38.780]   - That's the goal.
[02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:41.140]   - Yeah, those aren't just words.
[02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:46.140]   Those are real aspirational possible things
[02:08:46.140 --> 02:08:50.300]   that could be accomplished if people do this work.
[02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:53.580]   And in coming here today and sharing with us
[02:08:53.580 --> 02:08:56.540]   the structure of internal family systems
[02:08:56.540 --> 02:09:00.960]   and a demonstration of how it can work
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:03.360]   and offering people the opportunity
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:05.520]   to do it themselves in real time
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:07.420]   and giving us your perspective
[02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:10.600]   about the things that are around it,
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:13.800]   as well as in it with incredible clarity
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:18.800]   and just a real beautiful sense of care
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:22.320]   for people that comes through.
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:25.800]   But also the, I like the concreteness of it so very much.
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:26.640]   - It's very concrete.
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:28.960]   - Right, it's not abstract.
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:29.920]   - Right.
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:31.720]   - And I really appreciate that.
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:34.440]   And I'm certain that everyone else does as well.
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:37.480]   So I wanna thank you for coming here today,
[02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:38.680]   for sharing this.
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:42.060]   We will provide links to places where people can learn more
[02:09:42.060 --> 02:09:46.000]   through books and courses and other resources
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.880]   that you've created.
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:49.680]   And also just for the work that you've done
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:51.800]   and for being you, it's been a real pleasure.
[02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:54.920]   And I'm so very glad we did it.
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:55.760]   - Me too.
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:58.880]   Oh my God, I know my little nervous parts
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:01.080]   were giving me a lot of trouble.
[02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:03.980]   But once we got going, I just felt connected
[02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:07.520]   and I felt your appreciation and interest.
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:12.240]   And so we could have this kind of self-to-self exchange,
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:14.000]   which I love.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.760]   I just love spending time in that energy.
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:17.600]   - Yeah, likewise.
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:20.400]   - And you're a great interviewer too.
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:21.680]   So yeah. - Thank you.
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:24.440]   Well, this whole thing is a labor of love
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:29.440]   and a free fall through just curiosity.
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:32.480]   - Yeah, yeah, it's clear.
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:35.000]   - Yeah, I hope to continue the conversation.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:35.940]   - Would love to.
[02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:37.760]   - Wonderful, thanks so much.
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:39.240]   - Thank you so much.
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:41.040]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion

[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:20.000]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.200]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:22.840]   It's my very first book.
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:24.240]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:26.400]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:27.560]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:28.720]   for more than five years,
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:31.040]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:32.600]   of research and experience.
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:35.640]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:38.140]   to exercise, to stress control,
[02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:40.600]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:43.960]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:46.040]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:49.940]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:52.280]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:54.040]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:55.840]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:58.440]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:00.480]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:03.600]   I am HubermanLab on all social media platforms.
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:06.320]   So that's InstagramX, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:08.560]   Facebook, LinkedIn, and Threads.
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:09.740]   And on all those platforms,
[02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:11.800]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:13.360]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:14.800]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:16.840]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:18.360]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:21.780]   Again, that's HubermanLab on all social media platforms.
[02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:23.100]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:24.700]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:12:24.700 --> 02:12:25.980]   the Neural Network Newsletter
[02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:28.020]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[02:12:28.020 --> 02:12:29.380]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:31.180]   as well as what we call protocols
[02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:33.460]   in the form of one to three page PDFs
[02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:35.760]   that cover everything from how to optimize your sleep,
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:38.560]   how to optimize dopamine, deliberate cold exposure.
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:40.300]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:43.380]   that covers cardiovascular training and resistance training.
[02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:45.860]   All of that is available completely zero cost.
[02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:47.580]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:49.460]   go to the menu tab in the top right corner,
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:51.980]   scroll down to newsletter and enter your email.
[02:12:51.980 --> 02:12:52.820]   And I should emphasize
[02:12:52.820 --> 02:12:55.460]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:12:55.460 --> 02:12:56.860]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:12:56.860 --> 02:12:59.300]   for today's discussion with Dr. Richard Schwartz.
[02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:01.500]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:03.380]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:13:03.380 --> 02:13:05.960]   [upbeat music]
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:08.540]   (upbeat music)
