[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   So a 19 year old Mark reads a bunch of like antiquity and classics high school, college.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.300]   What important lesson did you learn from it?
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.360]   Not just interesting things you found, but like there aren't that many tokens you consume
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.360]   by the time you're 19.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.180]   A bunch of them were about the classics.
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.180]   Clearly that was important in some way.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:24.140]   I mean, one of the things I thought was really fascinating is so when Augustus was first,
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:32.580]   so he became emperor and he was trying to establish peace and there was no real conception
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.060]   of peace at the time.
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.520]   Like the people's understanding of peace was it is the temporary time between when your
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.160]   enemies will inevitably attack you again.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.700]   So you get like a short rest and he had this view, which is like, look, like we want to
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.620]   change the economy from instead of being so mercenary and like, and kind of militaristic
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.780]   to like actually this positive something.
[00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.300]   It's like a very novel idea at the time.
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.500]   I think that there's like something that's just really fundamental about that.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.660]   It's like in terms of the bounds on like what people can conceive at the time of like what
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.900]   are rational ways to work and I'm going back to like, and this applies to both the metaverse
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.260]   and the AI stuff, but like a lot of investors and just different people just can't wrap
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.780]   their head around why we would open source this.
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.780]   I don't understand.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.300]   It's like open source, that must just be like the temporary time between which you're making
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:37.460]   things proprietary, but I actually think it's like this very profound thing in tech that
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.500]   creates a lot of winners, right?
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.100]   And it's, and so I don't know, I don't want to strain the analogy too much, but I do think
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.620]   that there's, there's a lot of times I think ways where you can, that are just like models
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.540]   for building things that people can't even like, they just like often can't wrap their
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.740]   head around how that would be a valuable thing for people to go do, or like a reasonable
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.060]   state of the world that I think there's more reasonable things than people think.
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.060]   That's super fascinating.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.740]   Can I give you my answer, what I was thinking?
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.740]   Sure.
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.740]   You might've gotten from it.
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.540]   This is probably totally off, but just how young some of these people are who have very
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.540]   important roles in the empire, like Caesar Augustus is like, by the time he's 19, he's
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.660]   actually incredibly, one of the most prominent people in Roman politics and he's like leading
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.880]   battles and forming the second triumvirate.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.660]   I wonder if you were like the 19 year old is like, I can actually do this because like
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.660]   Caesar Augustus did this.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.860]   I think that's an interesting example, both from a lot of history and American history
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.860]   too.
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.940]   I mean, one of my favorite quotes, it's this Picasso quote that all children are artists
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.060]   and the challenge is how do you remain an artist when you grow up?
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.860]   And it's like, basically I think, cause when you're younger, I think it's just easier to
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.860]   have kind of wild ideas and you're not, you know, you have no, there are all these analogies
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.460]   to the innovators dilemma that exist in your life as well as your company or whatever you've
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.460]   built.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.460]   Right.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.460]   So, you know, you're kind of earlier on your trajectory.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.140]   I think it's easier to pivot and take in new ideas without it disrupting other commitments
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.540]   that you've made to, to different things.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.940]   And so I don't know, I think that that's an interesting part of running a company is like,
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.900]   how do you, how do you kind of stay dynamic?
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.900]   Right.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.900]   Thank you.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.900]   Thank you.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:30.900]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
