[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.320]   I know Titan A has mentioned this, but you all are answers to prayers.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.100]   When we started the Mathema Institute, Titan A and I have constantly prayed that the Lord
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.280]   would help us connect with believers in the sciences.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.920]   And my heart is full seeing you and seeing all of you here.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.760]   You are all the answer to our prayers.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.200]   We can't stress that enough.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.920]   Let's start by asking a few introductory questions.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.080]   So if you would please introduce yourselves, tell us your full name and what is your academic
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.200]   background and where do you work?
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.840]   And we'll start, let's see, over here.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.120]   My name is Zisong Wang.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.120]   I came from China.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.460]   I got my PhD in electrical engineering this year at UC Irvine.
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.460]   Thank you.
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.460]   Finally.
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.800]   Yeah, it's a seven year program for a PhD.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.560]   And then currently working at Irvine in Marvell Semiconductor Technology, working for CHIPS
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.280]   for optical communication.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.080]   Hi, I'm Joey Kim.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.180]   My PhD is in chemical engineering.
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.800]   I got it at the California Institute of Technology and I am very blessed because I get to work
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.640]   here at the Masters University as part of the biology department, as well as being the
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.200]   department chair of the engineering and computer science.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.720]   So very lucky to be here.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.100]   Hi, my name is Karl Geier.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.100]   I'm from Germany.
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.720]   I moved here now years ago to study at the Masters Seminary.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.800]   Before I came here, I worked as a physician in Germany.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.240]   So the trauma and orthopedic department, but the Lord called me now here.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.400]   So my story is quite different from the other folks, but I'm happy to share.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.040]   Well, you don't know, maybe it's the same story.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.040]   Andres Solonpas.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.440]   My first PhD is aerospace engineering from University of Virginia.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.100]   My second one, working on it now, material science at Johns Hopkins University.
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.900]   I'm a department chair for cybersecurity, American public university system, quite a
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.480]   bit of work in machine learning, AI, also a lot of hardware development stuff.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.480]   Thank you.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.480]   Thank you.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.480]   Wow.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.800]   I love the diversity of backgrounds here, especially, you know, academic backgrounds
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.080]   and things like that.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.920]   Feel free to connect with them as, you know, people from your field.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.480]   And I would like to continue by asking, what was your upbringing?
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.640]   Did you grow up in a Christian home?
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.520]   Did you grow up in a non-Christian home?
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.200]   If you grew up in a non-Christian home, how did you come to know the Lord?
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.240]   And we'll start on that side with Andres.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.240]   Sure.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.240]   So definitely not a Christian home.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.560]   Eastern Europe back in 1980s, if you know about Eastern Europe in 1980s, enforced atheism,
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.040]   nothing but atheism, and that's kind of what we grew up in, in the house.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:59.320]   Anyway, it's a very long story I'll have to share one day.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.720]   So I grew up in non-Christian home.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.400]   The first 10 years of my life, when I was 10, my parents got saved.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.720]   But my life changed very radically from a very liberal way of life to very legalistic
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.720]   and conservative.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.800]   So I saw, like, in a way, both ends.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.400]   And this raised, like, a lot of questions.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.520]   If the Bible is true, and if this kind of church has this kind of laws and rules, and
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.520]   we can't find them in the Bible, what is the Bible about?
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.720]   So I started to read, to study the Bible more for my own, to get the answers of the questions
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.780]   that the church couldn't provide.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.760]   And I think with the time, even starting with the wrong understanding of the gospel, the
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.640]   Lord was gracious and opened my eyes to see Him in His grace.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.160]   - Yeah, I grew up, it's hard to say Christian, but I can for sure say church-attending family.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.640]   That was, like, one of my first earliest memories was just running around at church.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.960]   But it was a Korean church, and I'm seeing most of you guys aren't Korean, so just to
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.740]   give you a little insight, it seems they care more about morality as opposed to the gospel.
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:15.340]   And so just growing up in church, I just learned to be, you know, things like humble, sacrificial,
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.860]   and that's what actually really led me to pursuing a PhD, because I wanted to essentially
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.040]   make the scientists and engineering community my mission field.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:34.360]   Nevertheless, I hear, like, you know, some, you know, calming assurances, no, I didn't
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.280]   know what the gospel was.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.600]   So my motives was actually to really become famous and influential.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.420]   But that's kind of the deceptive nature that I grew up in.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:50.140]   And it was only when I was in graduate school that I was fed up with a lot of the California
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:56.860]   churches that I've been attending, their superficial teachings, that I decided to Google, or yeah,
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.160]   turn to Google for, like, you know, spiritual nourishment, which you should, I highly don't
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.200]   recommend, and I also knew that, by the way, but that was just the point of desperation
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   that I came to.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.160]   And luckily, the Lord used that as an opportunity, despite that being a terrible idea.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.680]   That's where I was first led to, you know, Paul Washer, and through a series of his messages,
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.880]   I actually became to know what the gospel was.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.520]   And I had an inclination to really drop my PhD at that exact moment, go attend seminary,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.720]   because the Korean churches definitely needed the gospel.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.520]   However, going back into a little bit of my testimony, I decided to finish my PhD and
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.160]   still, you know, well, I still have that mission field of making the science and engineering
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.840]   community my mission field, and that's where the Lord has brought me here.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.680]   And now I get to mentor the next generation of engineers in the way that, you know, the
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.680]   Lord sees fit.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.320]   And of course, I tried to do everything from the Bible-first standpoint.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.240]   >> I guess it's my turn.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.240]   Thank you.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.700]   So I grew up in China, atheist family.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.720]   My father is a mathematician, mother is a doctor in the ER room.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.560]   So I was thorough atheist, I would say, growing up.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.080]   Before my conversion, I never went to church almost.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.100]   Lord has really, I would say, go beyond the normal to save me.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:38.360]   When I come to America, all I want is just build my American dream, my career dream,
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.720]   get the best education as possible.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.720]   And then there's time I just want to end the academia, everything, but Lord never give
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.000]   me up.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.920]   Through knowledge, I cannot learn Him, basically.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.380]   I just think it doesn't make sense.
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.960]   If you guys believe God, show me, right?
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.600]   As an engineering or scientific mind, we don't even believe what's published by peer-reviewed
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   papers.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:13.480]   How come you bring up to me several uneducated guy, give me some manuscript, even different
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:21.080]   from each other, and then tell me this is absolute truth and no argument?
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.600]   If you don't believe this, you're a sinner.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   Right?
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   What is going on here?
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   Right?
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.280]   That's always my question.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.680]   No one can show me any solid proof in my mind at that time.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.800]   But through life, Lord slowly lead me to Him.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.080]   My mom passed away very early, and she's a doctor.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.560]   We just hear the message, you have a lot of medical knowledge, you cannot heal life.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.360]   And I know that from my personal experience.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:54.360]   My mom got a chronic cancer, chronic tumor in her head, five years, and leading to death.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.000]   She can heal a lot of people, but she cannot even heal herself.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.040]   When she got that diagnosis, she's like, death sentence, right?
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.880]   Then the entire family become nothing.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.720]   Spring Festival in China become my nightmare, because everyone is celebrating.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.520]   I have to go back home, cook for my mom and father.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.080]   That's all my college.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:30.920]   And then when I first began my PhD, the first year, my best friend committed suicide, age
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.880]   27, top student.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.920]   He has a very rich family.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:43.040]   I remember their family bought a tea table for like $100,000, hired the entire plane,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.480]   just don't want anyone to touch it.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.120]   And when he got deep depression, I was like, why you got deep depressed?
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.720]   I have a much worse life, and I'm still fine, why you got deep depressed?
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.480]   I thought he's joking, but years later, he committed suicide and died.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.200]   And then I pursue, basically, relationship.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.440]   I used to have a girlfriend.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.000]   We dated for eight and a half years.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.120]   And because of long distance dating, we end up broken up, break up.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:23.960]   So before I know the Lord, basically, my career, my life, my friendship, everything, by the
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.680]   way, even my PhD, I initiated at USC, and the work I was doing there was taken over
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.620]   by someone else.
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:37.360]   So then my career, my friendship, my family, everything, the Lord has shown me in my life,
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   this is a vanity.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.640]   And that time, Christian come to me saying, oh, God so love the world.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.680]   I think that's nonsense, because why God love vanity?
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.000]   It just doesn't make any sense to me.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.640]   But Lord see me anyway, I think through prayer.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.360]   There is time I was involved in a very complicated situation.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.200]   I just like, okay, I give the Lord a try.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.040]   It's not biblical, but Lord had showed grace to me anyway.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.820]   He answered my prayer.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:13.240]   Something I cannot figure out for months, he helped me figure out in a few hours.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.400]   And I was really like, what's going on here?
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.760]   - What was that?
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.120]   - We have time for that, okay.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.720]   That was a relationship I was really trying to pursue.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.920]   She actually was a non-believer, but she's a professing Christian.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.400]   I was trying to date her.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.440]   And through her, actually, I met the pastor who baptized me.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.040]   I was trying to date her.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:45.240]   She asked me to go to a restaurant with a young out, sit down with her pastor.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.880]   And she got a phone call, she went away.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.320]   And then I have to sit down with this pastor.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:57.520]   That's my first time I have to hear gospel, because I don't know when that girl will come
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.160]   back.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.080]   And amazingly, that night went very well.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.960]   And I was like, oh, so Christianity is not totally nonsense.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:13.160]   He explained to me what is vanity, why God still love this world.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.040]   The gospel suddenly makes sense to me.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.920]   And then I was like, showing me whether you are true.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:28.200]   And then that night, within three hours, Lord actually showed me this girl I was pursuing.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.480]   She's not believer.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.040]   She's actually simultaneously dating three boys.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.320]   So I was like, by my own wisdom, I cannot figure this out, why she is so weird.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.520]   But God can figure it out.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.360]   That night, I was like, okay, this God doesn't care who you said you are.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.960]   He care about truth.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.960]   He care.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.960]   And I immediately have fear.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.160]   I was like, He even know what kind of a girl I will like.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.520]   He even know when I'm going to be very, you know, creepy to follow a girl.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.920]   He set everything up to finally lead me to gospel, to Jesus.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.240]   I was like, how can he be so gracious to me?
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.400]   It just doesn't make any sense.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.480]   So I began to follow him till now, yeah.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.480]   Praise God.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.160]   Carl, we'll start with you on this question.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.040]   What made you interested in science in general?
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.880]   So early on in my childhood, I loved the nature.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.200]   I loved butterflies, all the kind of insects.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.520]   But in the same time, I also loved or was interested in any kind of diseases.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.400]   I always asked, okay, why did this person has to suffer?
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.360]   Or someone had like an accident, there was a fracture, or how can it heal again?
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.080]   So it was always this kind of interest in my life.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:47.000]   When I finished my 10th grade in school, I decided first to do something completely different.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.800]   I did an apprenticeship becoming an electrician first.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.720]   So I went through this kind of three years.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:13:00.720]   In my second year, so my grandparents, they left with us, and my granddad got a very aggressive
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   kind of cancer.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.880]   He died in a few months only.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.000]   So on the whole time, all this kind of things with the doctors, the visits, all this diagnosis
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.360]   and therapies, we had no idea what does happen.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:17.840]   So I said, Lord, I was in a way always interested in medicine, and it's not easy to get into
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.840]   med school.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.200]   It's kind of hard in Germany, but I thought if it's your way for my life, I would love
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.720]   to go this way to serve you first of all, but also so many people who needs help, not
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.680]   because I can heal them, but because I saw how many questions people even have.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.920]   And if I can help them, I would be happy to.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.260]   So basically, I said, Lord, if you want to have me there, you will open all the doors.
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.640]   And he was graciously also in this.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.280]   And I started in Münster.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.360]   It's like a bigger med school in Germany for six years.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.360]   Amazing.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.360]   Andrei, what about you?
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.680]   Yeah, I always had interest in mathematics.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.960]   So actually, when the way things worked in Ukraine back in the day is essentially they
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.160]   put you in the schools and all the schools have numbers.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.480]   So I was in school number four, but I found it a little bit boring.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.600]   So I just out of curiosity, I went out and applied for this like very math heavy, what
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.760]   do they call it, it's not a gymnasium, but anyway, they have a special name for these
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.760]   type of schools.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.120]   And I was accepted, which was great.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.520]   And so long story short, like this mathematics was actually like always, I found it exciting,
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.360]   you know, and I guess maybe one thing that I'll say, you know, when the way the society
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.440]   was structured back in the 80s and the 90s in Eastern Europe, you were told what you're
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.440]   going to do.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.440]   It wasn't like, go try things out.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.640]   No, it was like, you will be a scientist, you will be a doctor, you know, it sounds
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.220]   like, all right, well, there it is.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.560]   So and then the other thing that I had passion for is I thought I was going to be like an
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:48.360]   astronaut and fly, and so anyway, that interest has always been just intrinsically in me.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.320]   You know, it just so happens that I eventually, you know, joined the military, kind of like
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:57.160]   traveled the world, searched God all over the world, you know, but eventually I realized
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.400]   that, and I think I've done enough deployments, I guess, in my life, and I realized that for
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:06.320]   me to probably live to the age of 30, I probably have to go to college, even though I told
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.240]   my parents I'll never do that.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:14.440]   Here I am, you know, teaching kids, but, you know, that's the way things worked out.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.600]   When I went to college, I was in my, maybe like early 20s, mid-20s by this point, and
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.240]   I really, really, really enjoyed it.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.080]   Like an early class for me, like 8.30 compared to the military at 5.30, right?
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:30.320]   So it was like early classes, really, like mid-afternoon, but, and I fell in love with
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.320]   that.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.320]   I mean, I loved it.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.320]   It was the easiest thing I've ever done.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.480]   Well, I don't want to say that, but anyway, I did fall in my first qualifier, never quit,
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.400]   and I did apply to Johns Hopkins on three occasions before I finally got accepted once.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.680]   So the point I'm trying to make is never quit.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:47.240]   I mean, everybody can do it, I think, but, you know, and then I think once you get into
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.600]   it and you kind of, at some point, I think it was maybe like third or fourth year of
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.880]   my undergrad studies, like things clicked, and I was like, oh, I get it, like these equations
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.160]   actually make sense, and after that, it's just never stopped, I never looked back, and
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.160]   I love it.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.080]   I think, you know, the earth, the universe, everything testifies of the glory of God.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.800]   It truly does, you know, right now we're working a lot of the high power computing, you know,
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.880]   we're talking quintillions of computations every second, every second, quintillions of
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   computations.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.880]   What is quintillions?
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.880]   Oh, quintillions?
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.880]   I don't know that word.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:23.440]   So multiply a million times a million times a billion, yeah, every second.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:29.000]   So just think of the number of zeros after that, and we've been working on these models
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.880]   for years, and we can't break the smallest code of these enzymes that are ten times smaller
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.080]   than the smallest known enzyme in the human body.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.080]   Think about that.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.080]   Mind-blowing.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:48.600]   So whoever created the human body clearly is brilliant, beyond our wildest imagination,
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:55.240]   army of Nobel laureates armed with literally infinite memory, computing power that we can't
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:02.640]   even dream of, and we can't even break, you know, a structure, we can't even model a structure
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:07.320]   that is ten times smaller than the smallest known enzyme in the human body.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.320]   Think about that.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.280]   And I think, you know, to me, just science testifies of the brilliance of God.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.560]   I think it's very naive when people are like, "I'm going to stand before God and ask Him
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.560]   questions."
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.560]   It's like, I don't think it's going to go that way.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.560]   I think it's going to be more like, "Oh, wait a minute, I put you on the planet Earth to
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.320]   do a certain thing for me, and you didn't."
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.640]   I think it's going to be more like that conversation.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.320]   But anyway, that's my interest in science.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.320]   I love that.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.320]   What about you, Zisan?
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:37.800]   When I chose my career, at that time, I was an unbeliever, so I chose whatever can bring
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:43.160]   my own self-benefit, and I grew up in China, also kind of patriarch, that's how they train
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.160]   you.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.000]   At that time, China is backward in cheap design, so I chose that area.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.640]   That was why I chose that, and Lord slowly showed me even in that area, it's kind of
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.180]   vanity, you know, in many ways.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:05.920]   But after I followed God, I can see God's glory can be reflected even through the cheap
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.920]   design.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:12.760]   I mean, the small chip I designed, it's like a fingertip, like a nail size, right?
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:18.180]   And that takes years for a thousand PhDs to develop a single one, and sometimes we make
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.180]   mistakes.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:27.800]   But then I think about God, who designed the whole universe in six days, and he made no
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.160]   mistake, and just by himself, just speak the word, and it happened.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:40.240]   I was like, my brain used to challenge him, question him, you know, how foolish I am and
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.840]   how glorious he is, yeah.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   Joey?
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.840]   Money.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.840]   Honest.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:55.720]   So, I wasn't naturally interested in the world.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.760]   I wasn't good at math.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:03.920]   My high school GPA was 3.1 or something, so I was just passing by with, I got a collection
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.400]   of A's, B's, and C's.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:14.320]   But my family, I think probably many of you guys might be able to kind of connect with
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.320]   me on this.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:22.680]   A lot of the arguments that my parents had was financially motivated, and so for me,
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.920]   being a believer at the time, money was the solution to pretty much all of my problems.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.640]   And so that's what really motivated me.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:38.320]   Initially, oh, excuse me, could I get some water?
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:45.480]   So I actually began as a chemistry major, and as the summer was progressing leading
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.580]   up to my freshman year, people were just giving me counsel, like, oh, you need to switch to
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.680]   chemical engineering, you need to switch to chemical engineering, and I was like, wait,
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.680]   why?
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.520]   Like, so originally, I wanted to leave as many options as possible, and pharmacy at
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.440]   the time was paying quite a bit.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.360]   And so I wanted to leave that as an option, but during orientation week freshman year,
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:13.000]   this is before I stepped foot in a single class, I went up to my academic advisor who
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.360]   was in the chemistry department, and so I asked him, I was like, hey, a lot of people
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.080]   are telling me to switch to chemical engineering, can you tell me the difference between the
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.280]   two?
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:28.280]   And he was like, okay, in chemistry, you take reactants, and then you make a product.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:33.880]   And I was like, all right, in chemical engineering, you take reactants, and then you make profit.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:40.280]   I was like, all right, no brainer, and so as soon as I went back to my dorm before my
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:45.880]   butt hit the chair, I was beginning the process of switching to chemical engineering.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:51.080]   And after I did, the following semester, my decision got confirmed, because I remember
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:56.600]   I was with my friends, and there was a postdoctoral, you know, teacher who was teaching a class
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:02.240]   or two, and out of curiosity, me and my friends asked him, hey, how much do you make?
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.640]   He thought a little bit, he was like, probably less than you think.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.320]   I was like, wait, what?
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:15.880]   But there was a professor overseer who was actually running the course, and so my friends,
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.240]   we asked him, oh, what about Professor Lenhoff, how much does he make?
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.680]   He pauses, he's like, probably more than you think.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:30.480]   And at that point, my dollar signs in my eyes, and I'm like, yes, I made the proper decision.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:35.960]   And ultimately, I share this, because now I don't really care about money at all.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:41.280]   And that, for me, was the power of the gospel, and I don't know, do we have time to go over?
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.440]   I'll just share that.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.080]   So I was just money motivated, that was pretty much it.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:52.120]   And I'm not, once again, I still don't know the gospel at this time, but I was going to
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:58.720]   church, and one of the pastors, he shared a testimony on somebody else's behalf of like,
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:05.580]   oh, this person, she had the opportunity to go to MIT's mechanical engineering PhD program,
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.680]   but then she gave it up to be a missionary in Europe.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:15.320]   And he set this to, once again, highlight this sacrificial nature, the thing that a
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.140]   lot of Korean churches are promoting.
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:24.200]   But for me, when I heard that, I wasn't impressed at all, actually, I wanted to throw up.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:29.440]   Because I saw the atheistic nature of the science and engineering community, all of
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.340]   my professors, how my students were behaving.
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.740]   If you wanted to do missions, why not go to MIT?
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.380]   That for me, I, yes.
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:47.140]   And so I'm not, I was I sinfully judging this unknown person back then, yes, I think that
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:53.580]   judgment is improper now, but nevertheless, the Lord did use that moment to really change
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.880]   something in me, to rip the idol of money out of me, because when my world was shaking
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.900]   at that time, I told God, I was like, God, if you give me an opportunity to go to a place
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.260]   like MIT, I'm going.
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.300]   And by the way, this was literally a long shot, because I told you my high school GPA
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.300]   was 3.1.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:17.500]   My SATs, I got a 480 on the reading and writing comprehension, literally, I can statistically
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:25.900]   show you the power of God by looking, by comparing the average SAT scores of Caltech students
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.060]   to my SAT score.
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.820]   It is a world's difference, but the Lord made that happen.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:37.420]   And this is why, even though when I heard the gospel, I wanted to give up my PhD, I
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:43.660]   did recall that moment, I said, Lord, if you give me an opportunity to go to a place like
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.420]   MIT, I'm going.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:49.340]   The science and engineering community will be my mission field, and that's why I stuck
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:54.340]   it out, and the Lord brought me here, and I'm just so thankful that I still get to serve
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.340]   him in that capacity.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:00.860]   - I love that, and I think many of us resonate with the heart to be missionaries or be sharing
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.980]   belights in our workplace, so thank you for that, that was wonderful.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:11.740]   So we'll start with you, Joey, on the next question, since you're tearing up.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.380]   So this is a question for all of you.
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:18.000]   For those of you who work at secular institutions or have worked at secular institutions, could
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.900]   you talk a little bit about what that's like, and also witnessing how you've been lights,
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.300]   how you've seen the Lord working, and also, could you talk about people's reactions to
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.300]   you as Christians?
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.140]   Have you faced persecution?
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.140]   Have people been supportive?
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.060]   Have you had opportunities to share the gospel?
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.060]   Joey, we'll start with you.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.060]   - Yeah, I'll begin.
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:42.260]   I think the level of hostility has changed from when I was in undergrad to graduate school.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:48.140]   So in undergraduate, a lot more of it was just kind of like implied, whereas in grad
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:55.700]   school times, this was when a lot of the abortion debate was heating up, as well as a lot of
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:03.460]   racists, these kind of notions began to come into play, so it was a lot more explicit opposition.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:10.540]   But nevertheless, regardless of how in my face it was, there was just an implied cultural
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:16.420]   understanding or assumption that the Bible was wrong, because Bible was from 2,000 years
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.700]   ago, science has developed, we now know things that people didn't know even two years ago.
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:27.780]   I trust this fairy tale book from 2,000 years ago, and that was pretty much the basic assumptions.
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:32.940]   And so when I was telling my friends, "Oh, there's a Christian meeting that I'm going
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:38.140]   to on campus, they're all working," they thought I was being lazy and stuff.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:44.460]   It was an excuse to not work, although I stayed up till 4 a.m. pretty much every single day,
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:49.700]   but they still kind of had that accusation.
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.060]   In graduate school, it became a little bit more explicit, and I think I'll just share
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.700]   this one notable experience.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:04.500]   As my PhD was finishing up, I was speaking with my advisor about the future plans, like
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.820]   what am I going to do afterwards?
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.980]   I told her my intention was to continue in academia.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:15.860]   At this point, I did know the gospel, I did reorient my thinking into forget money, I
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:22.060]   want to be a missionary in the science and engineering community.
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:27.820]   That did not mean, actually at that point, just to show you, highlight how much of a
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.980]   bubble I lived in, I didn't know Christian universities were a thing.
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:38.020]   I thought it was public school or all private schools were Catholic.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.420]   That's what I grew up in.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:47.340]   So I wanted to teach, obviously not at a Catholic school, just a public research institution.
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:53.940]   There was one advice that my advisor gave me, and it was not, "Highlight this research
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:58.340]   that you did, how it was a very difficult problem, but you solved it," it was not that.
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:03.140]   It was not, "Oh, go speak to this person so that he can write you a letter of recommendation,"
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.700]   it was not that either.
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:09.540]   The only advice that she gave me was, "Don't tell them you're a Christian."
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.300]   I was like, "What, what?"
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:18.100]   She obviously saw my expression and she reiterated, "If you want to get hired, don't tell them
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.100]   you're a Christian."
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:25.220]   In my mind, I'm like, "That's illegal," and I think I actually also said it because she
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.640]   responded with, "They don't care."
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.820]   They don't care it was illegal to reject me based on my religious belief.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:40.600]   That's when I was like, "Do I really want to work at a place like this, much in opposition?"
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:45.180]   I know I wanted to be a missionary, but I was a very young believer at that time.
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:53.020]   I was still searching for, one, just understanding what the Bible was about, and secondarily,
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:58.220]   just even if I know what the Bible is about, I'm so young in my spiritual faith, I don't
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.500]   know what living the Christian life looks like.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:07.420]   I also wanted some level of Christian mentorship, not just for them to tell me doctrinal knowledge,
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.600]   but how they actually live.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:15.820]   This is, at the same time, my world flipped upside down because Pastor John in one of
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.980]   his sermons mentioned the Master's College.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.100]   I Googled what the Master's College was, and now it's the Master's University.
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.660]   Wow, Christian universities are a thing.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:34.100]   Ever since then, TMU was my dream job, or dream destination to teach at, and that's
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.940]   kind of how everything transpired.
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:43.740]   But yeah, in terms of the level of hostility, my single advice I got for pursuing future
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.660]   career paths was to simply say, "Don't tell them you're a Christian."
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:47.660]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.660]   Wow.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.780]   What about you, Seung?
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:56.060]   Me, I just began to work, so there's still some tasks.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:00.060]   After my Ph.D., my professor is kind of, I don't know what he may consider himself as
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.060]   God.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:07.900]   I remember before Easter, even this year, close to my graduation, he said, he clearly
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.900]   knows I'm a Christian.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.780]   He said, "Okay, this one, you cannot go to church.
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.260]   You have to finish this paper.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.860]   I guarantee you, you listen to me, you will not go to hell."
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.220]   I was like, "How can you guarantee me that?"
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:24.660]   Well, that's basically my entire Ph.D., I consider him as my Egyptian pharaoh.
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:29.020]   I was praying, "Lord, when will you deliver me from this?"
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:33.700]   Yeah, he delivered me the enemy, finally.
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.580]   I was like, I'm a very impatient person, but this is Lord's providence for me to really
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.340]   learn how to be patient.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:44.900]   But during this program, seven years, Lord didn't put me there in vain.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:51.940]   I was actively involved in Bridgeton National, it's a campus ministry under campus crusade,
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.680]   specifically reaching out to international students.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:00.820]   At least, I think there are three or four students came to Christ through me.
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:09.420]   Last year, I baptized together with a seminary, we baptized a Turkish brother who used to
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.220]   be actually a radical Muslim.
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:17.300]   Well, he actually got his green card because he applied asylum for Muslim faith.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.420]   He's that radical, even Turkish government has to persecute him.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.740]   Now, he become a full-time minister at campus crusade.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.620]   Yeah, that's just Jesus Christ, that's God.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.140]   So Lord didn't waste my time there.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:37.020]   And in my work, the company, I remember when I was doing intern last year, I have a colleague
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:43.060]   sit down with me, and opening mark of him is, "All religions are stupid, all religions
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.060]   are stupid."
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.060]   I was like, "Okay."
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.740]   I was like, "Okay, I don't know how to do that," but I said, "I probably will agree
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.220]   with you, all religions are stupid, but I will tell you, Christianity is not religion,
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.500]   it's just truth."
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:58.180]   We had an interesting conversation, and after a while, he said, "Oh, okay, I figured."
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:01.060]   I said, "Yeah, this is just your belief."
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:07.300]   I used to think like that, but it's not like that anymore, it's just a different set of
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.300]   belief.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:15.260]   You can have your own opinion, make it logical, but God's logic, it make more sense to me.
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.280]   That's just apologetics opportunity.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:24.700]   But I think most encouraging time during that internship, if you remember, I shared my testimony,
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:31.460]   my PhD work was taken over at USC to another student, and we were colleagues at the company.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:37.020]   So at the last week of my internship, he sit down with me during lunch, somehow, the other
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:43.260]   colleagues left, and they pick up their lunch, and we sit on the same table, just me and
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.260]   him.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:50.700]   And he said to me, he said, "Jisung, whatever happened at USC, I did for you, I'm really
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.700]   sorry."
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.700]   I was like, "Huh."
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.380]   And he said, "What do you see?"
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:32:00.820]   I said, "Actually, I don't have a thing for you, because through that, Lord saved me.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.700]   So I thank you for this."
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.620]   He look at me, he's like, he's a Muslim, but he didn't really know God's forgiveness.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:13.860]   I said, "This is God's message for me to you, that God loves you also, and God also
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:14.860]   will forgive you.
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.540]   And who am I to judge you?"
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:24.340]   So yeah, that intrigues him about, okay, so Muslim God and Christian God is very different.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.860]   He's still not believing, but I'm still trying to witness to him.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.500]   Yeah, that's all I want to share.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.500]   Yeah.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.500]   Amazing.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.500]   Congratulating.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.500]   What about you, Andre?
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.500]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:40.180]   So, you know, when I was at UVA, I guess, you know, I came to Christ very late.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:44.180]   I was at the University of Virginia, maybe not quite a graduate student.
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.180]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.180]   Actually, you know what?
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.180]   Yeah, I was a graduate student at that point.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.740]   I had an internship in Moscow State University.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:54.420]   Long story, anyway, the pastor flew out, we talked, and finally, anyway, I was a graduate
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.420]   student.
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.780]   But after my repentance, you know, I kind of was like, you know what, I'm going to,
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.940]   if we're going to do this, we're going to do this right, right?
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:07.580]   So under my signature block, I put, "But unless you repent, you all too shall perish," right?
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.360]   It's just a quote from Jesus.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.520]   And I put it on my UVA signature block, and so then every email that goes out, you know,
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.980]   to my dean, to my chair, to my professors, to fellow students, I'm like, you know, maybe
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.340]   some read it, maybe some don't, and you know, and I got mixed feelings.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:28.540]   So I'll say this, my advisor at the time, she's a dean of research now, and I'm not
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.620]   going to name her, but she was very open to it.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:36.380]   She was very open, very understanding, one of the, like, the leading scientists in her
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.380]   field.
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.660]   But there were others who would, like, email me back, and they're like, "You asked me
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.380]   for a question, you asked me for help, and then you told me I'm going to perish.
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.220]   Why would you do that?"
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:49.180]   But my response is, "If you don't believe it, what are you worried about?"
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.180]   You know?
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.900]   And then they're like, "Well, yeah, that's true."
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.820]   So, but then something deep inside, it's like, "Oh, wait a minute.
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:57.820]   What is going to happen?"
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.020]   You know, and so there was a mixed feeling, and there was one time I was applying for
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:07.300]   a job, kind of a long story, but I was coming into this research field, and the hiring manager,
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.300]   you know, we interviewed.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.300]   I think it went great.
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.140]   I mean, I thought it went really well.
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:15.620]   She emails me back, and she says, "About this signature block of yours, do you think you
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:16.620]   could fit in our office?"
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:17.620]   And I was like, "Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:18.620]   Why not?"
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:19.620]   You know?
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.620]   I mean, you know?
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:23.740]   And long story short, I didn't get the job.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.260]   They never told me why.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.260]   I don't know.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:30.460]   But, you know, that was a blessing in disguise, because somebody else reached out, and they
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:35.060]   actually gave me a higher salary, and they put me into this office where I really enjoyed
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:38.660]   it, and this person became my mentor to this day.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.980]   This person is very, very high up there right now within the government.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:45.580]   I'm also not going to name—if you want to know offline, I'll tell you all their names,
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:46.580]   you know?
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.060]   But, yeah, that person is a mentor.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:54.100]   Like, to this day, this person, like, if I call them, within 20 minutes, I get a call
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.100]   back.
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.700]   Now, this person is, like, really high up there, reported to the Secretary of Defense,
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.700]   right?
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:03.300]   So, like, the point I'm trying to make is, like, it was a really mixed responses that
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.440]   I received.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.980]   Some people really disliked the quote from the Bible that they didn't even believe in,
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.980]   which I don't know why you don't like something you don't believe in.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.260]   And then the other people were like, "Well, you know, that's their beliefs."
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:19.860]   But God kind of opened up doors for me that I couldn't have envisioned in the past, right?
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.340]   And even now, you know, department chairs are very different.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:27.820]   I work in a secular university, and there's one department chair specifically, and she's
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:33.860]   very, very anti-religion in general, maybe, but anti-Christian for sure.
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:38.020]   But then, you know, she's very nice to me, and she says, "You know, the one thing that
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:43.260]   frustrates me about you, Andre, is you're so polite, so unbelievably polite."
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:51.180]   And I'm like, "I'm sorry, I'll try to change, I'm really sorry, but please accept my most
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.980]   sincere apologies," you know?
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:58.380]   And we laugh about it, but her publications, the stuff that I read that she writes on religion,
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.460]   I'm like, "I don't think this is right, I think this is, like, purely your beliefs,"
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.460]   you know?
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:08.620]   So, but again, mixed feelings, despite all of that, you know, I don't think it was the
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:12.100]   universities that were pushing me along, or the graduate schools, or whatever else.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:16.180]   I think it was really God opening up the right doors, even though they weren't evident in
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.180]   the beginning.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.500]   As you can imagine, when I didn't get hired for this one job, I was like, "Oh, well, that's
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.500]   frustrating.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.500]   What do I do now?"
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.300]   And sure enough, somebody else reached out, and they're like, "Hey, what do they offer
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.300]   you?"
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.300]   "Oh, that sucks.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.860]   Like, come over here, we'll give you more," right?
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:34.760]   So, anyway, because we're going back to the mic, I'm just kidding, that's right, but anyway,
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:39.900]   so I think, you know, as long as you stick with it, I think God ultimately sees it through,
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:40.900]   right?
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:44.980]   So we read about Joseph, we read about David, right?
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.700]   You have so many stories of people that did not deny God.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.700]   It was tough.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.740]   I mean, it was really, really tough for Daniel, I'm sure.
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.700]   "Hey, look, we're going to put you with a bunch of lions, all right, for about a night.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.700]   You survive?"
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:00.220]   "Okay, well, forgiven, but if not, then, you know, tough luck."
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:04.220]   So but then look at Daniel, what happened after that.
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:08.020]   Even you look at what ended up happening, even the king was like, "We got to worship
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.300]   this God," you know?
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.780]   So I think you got to stick with it, even though you are going to feel a little bit
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:12.780]   of pressure.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:13.780]   But anyway, these are my thoughts on that.
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:14.780]   - Thank you.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:15.780]   Wow.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.780]   Very encouraging.
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:21.380]   Karl, what are your experience working in secular?
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:26.740]   - So in general, in Germany, the people, they are not hostile against Christianity, but
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.820]   at the same time, they're not interested.
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.320]   So if it's your belief, that's fine, do what you want.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.200]   But don't tell me anything about this.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.820]   So the task was in university, in med school, or even my hospital, I worked in the trauma
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.380]   department.
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.100]   It's all about relationships.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:47.100]   If they see that you're authentic, if you say you're Christian, then you don't have
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.540]   to ask them questions, they will come to you and ask you questions.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.740]   So I was praying, "Lord, that's hard.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:58.340]   I don't want to be an actor, just to act like someone.
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:02.940]   Help me to be really a reflection of your glory, to reach out to these kind of people."
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:07.380]   And probably like, as some other medical young people think, "Oh yeah, I can go to the hospital,
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:12.300]   I can preach the gospel to the patients," forget it, you have no time.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.100]   In the trauma emergency room, you have patient after patient.
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:20.540]   I worked up to 85 hours a week, 24-hour shifts every other day.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:25.420]   There's no time to preach the gospel to the patients, but to the co-workers, because they
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:30.440]   see you every day for 24 hours, for weeks.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:38.940]   So when I started first in the hospital, everyone was again, like, in a way, distanced because
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:40.380]   they were just observing me.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.800]   But with the time, they came to me and asked me, "Hey, you said you're Christian.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.060]   What do you think about this kind of thing, or this kind of matter?"
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:52.740]   Even at the end, when I had to resign, and I talked to my boss, I said, "Hey, I will
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:56.440]   leave to the States to study the Bible."
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.700]   He got in a way upset, but happy at the same time.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:04.380]   He said, "Karl, I really want you to stay with us, but I think study the Bible for you
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.420]   will be much more better.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.700]   So go, have my blessings, and do it."
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:15.520]   So it was just amazing to see how the Lord can use different kind of means and occasions.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:22.520]   I wasn't able, like, to preach and to see someone repenting, but I just hope that my
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:27.240]   presence there, being a reflection of Christ, was helpful to implement some seeds in the
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.240]   people's hearts.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.240]   - Wow.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.000]   So encouraging.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.720]   Amazing.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:39.440]   What encouragement do you have for Christians in sciences in STEM, and what is your prayer
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.440]   for them?
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.440]   Andrew, let's start with you.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   - Yeah.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.920]   I would say use the science to talk about God.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.120]   I mean, it's one of the arguments, I think, and that's the one that I'm trying to make
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.520]   in the paper as well, and I know it's still brewing in my head, and one day maybe I'll
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.640]   publish a book about it.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.560]   But it's, think about the argument of this whole thing in sciences.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.840]   There's no intelligence, and that's the intelligent argument we're making to you.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.840]   Just think about how absurd that is.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840]   - That's a great point.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.840]   - You know?
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.880]   And I'm intelligent because I do science, and I can tell you from an intelligent perspective
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.760]   that intelligence doesn't actually exist.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:18.400]   And if you don't believe me, you're not intelligent enough to understand what I'm telling you.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.480]   So it's just the absurdity of this whole argument, and then my counter-argument, and I've made
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:27.800]   this challenge to so many of my fellow colleagues and students now.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.200]   You know, if you're so intelligent, you clearly are much smarter than the Mother Nature, right?
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.020]   I mean, Mother Nature, her intelligence is zero.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.780]   So even a child, and I'm gonna go with just a little bit of mathematics here.
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.680]   You can actually divide by zero, did you know that?
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.680]   You actually get infinity.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:47.080]   We just don't tell the high school kids that because it gets so confused, you know?
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:51.120]   But if you actually integrate, you know, from infinity to infinity, you actually get a constant.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:57.280]   Anyway, so like, the bottom line is, you can divide by zero, but if Mother Nature's intelligence
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.360]   is zero, you multiply it by infinity, you get a number.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:06.960]   So basically, a child with an IQ of a certain number, be it 5, 10, or whatever the IQ is,
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.720]   right, is infinitely smarter than Mother Nature.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:15.560]   Then you, as a graduate student, are infinitely smarter in squared than Mother Nature.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:19.800]   Come to my lab and reproduce a smallest enzyme in the human body.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.080]   Oxalocortylate tautomerase is the name of it.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.080]   Shouldn't be that hard.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   Mother Nature did it.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.080]   Her intelligence is zero.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.080]   You're really smart.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.880]   I've been throwing this argument out there for decades now.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.720]   Not a single person accepted the challenge.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.360]   Well, why not?
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:39.080]   You know, so what I would tell people in science, you should, I don't want to say ridicule people,
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:44.960]   but like, you should kind of ridicule the idea that an unintelligent creator is more
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.680]   brilliant than an intelligent human being, right?
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.560]   But then whoever the creator is, okay, and I understand there's different directions
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:56.200]   you can take this argument, but whoever the creator is, he's way, way, way smarter than
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.640]   all the human beings combined.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.640]   And that's what I got from science.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.680]   And that's what I'd encourage everybody in science to say, look, if you're so smart,
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.440]   reproduce the smallest enzyme in the human body, and nobody will accept that challenge
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.440]   ever.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.440]   So, I don't know.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.440]   Thank you.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.920]   Karl, what about you?
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:21.120]   I was always impressed about why God gives some people wisdom, especially in medicine,
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.880]   to do things that seems to be in a way impossible.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:29.240]   Like even from the easiest things, like someone has a fracture, he goes to surgery and can
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:32.600]   walk again out, or we go into neurology or other things.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:39.000]   So there's always this kind of thing, the Lord is giving people wisdom to do something
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.240]   with the purpose to glorify his name.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.760]   Obviously, in the secular world, people don't do this with this purpose.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:49.000]   But this is the end of all means, because this is what the Lord created us.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.960]   So my wish for young scientists is always, hey, if the Lord gives you this kind of wisdom,
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:00.860]   use it first of all to marvel about the Lord, how big he is, how great he is.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.520]   He's the intelligence.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:07.000]   He's in a way the one who oversees all, who holds all together.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.320]   On the other hand, if he gives you wisdom, use it for his glory.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.440]   And yeah, we can have money reasons or other reasons.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:23.000]   But go back to your beginning, see the Lord, and use this wisdom to glorify his name and
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   to help people wherever he will place you.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Thank you.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.560]   What about you, Joey?
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.600]   I have a few things.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:35.000]   One, I think just how atheistic science and engineering community is.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.560]   I think this is one of the classic scenarios of like light shines brighter in the darkness.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:47.560]   And just like how Carl's demeanor, Andre, you're the most polite person apparently.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.840]   Right.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.140]   Like that, it becomes very noticeable.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.360]   I recently had a daughter.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.360]   Thank you.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.360]   Yes, yes.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.880]   The cutest baby in the world.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.560]   Yes.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:06.720]   And so a lot of parents think about their child's future and the child being born now,
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.560]   you might think I'm in this mental stress.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:15.520]   For me, I think this is an opportunity because as long as my daughter's not insane, she will
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:20.680]   be a great proponent for Jesus Christ.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.180]   You just need to not do anything insane.
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:29.600]   But obviously I'm trying to raise her to be much more than that, Christ-likeness, Christ-like
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.280]   excellence in all things, that's what we're trying to do.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:38.160]   And it just makes it that much easier for Christ's glory to be really demonstrated.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:44.440]   And hopefully that does open up opportunities for people to ask about the gospel, right?
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.200]   Perfect opportunity to share the gospel.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:53.560]   Another one, personal experience, you know, I love theology, you know, I'm attending seminary
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.360]   right now.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:02.280]   And I believe if I were to redo my life entire again, I would still choose chemical engineering,
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:10.260]   primarily because it helped me learn to think where I immediately know if I thought wrong.
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:14.800]   In theology, that's not always the case, and that's why you get into all of these heretical
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:15.800]   thoughts.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.960]   It really helped me to make logical connections appropriately.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:24.960]   And then I was digging into the Bible, I already knew what some of these logical errors were.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:31.280]   It helped formulate the mental mind frame for doing theology properly, and it just made
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:36.400]   my life so much easier in terms of pursuing the greatest truth that anyone can know, which
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.300]   is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:44.600]   Along that same vein, wait, I had a third one.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.720]   All right, maybe that's good enough.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:52.200]   >> I was gonna say that you teach logic at the Master's University, and, you know, it's
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.840]   wonderful to see your heart in that, and you're, you know, passing that along to disciples,
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.840]   right?
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.840]   >> Oh, actually, I did remember.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:45:59.840]   Okay.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:00.840]   >> That's what I was trying to talk.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:01.840]   That's what I was trying to give you some time for.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:02.840]   >> Okay.
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.840]   Okay.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:10.280]   So, you know, the culture just puts, you know, scientists and engineers on a pedestal today.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:14.480]   A lot of people, especially if they're not believers, they're using it for, I would say,
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.480]   incorrect purposes.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:22.200]   But we have the opportunity to actually use that pedestal, whether it's rightfully obtained
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:30.200]   or not, in a way that actually spreads the gospel at, yeah, it's just more opportunities
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.640]   for sharing the gospel.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.840]   And I don't think we should shy away from that.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.940]   Instead, we should try to really see it as an opportunity that God has gave each and
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:45.040]   every single one of us, to really use that as a platform to be the voice for the gospel.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.040]   >> Thank you.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.040]   That's very encouraging.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.040]   What about you, Tizong?
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:52.960]   >> Well, after these three great brothers shared, it's hard to add on, but I would see some
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.760]   insights I was doing.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.360]   There is time I really question why I'm still staying in this area.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:02.760]   You know, people are talking about AI is coming up, a company actually doing infrastructure
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.400]   for the AI.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:09.000]   So it's like, okay, maybe I'm doing some evil thing, I should really quit, you know, all
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   kinds of thoughts.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.880]   And with lawlessness, it increases, I think everyone, especially in scientific and engineering
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:18.760]   field, will feel like, okay, is this a field we should stay in?
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:24.280]   Because all the lawlessness in this area is even sometimes initiated by scientists and
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.280]   engineering.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.760]   So it's like, should we really stay there?
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:34.040]   But when I stay in the scripture, as I read, just in Genesis, Lord asked actually Adam
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:37.640]   to cultivate the field, right, cultivate the field.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:44.000]   It doesn't really, I think it doesn't just stay with the field on the earth, it's actually
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.540]   every field.
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:51.680]   But his first son, Cain, he is also a cultivator of the field, but he's the first murder.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.560]   So that's after the fall.
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.800]   So the problem is not the field, God created the field.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.840]   The problem is where your heart is, the problem is our sin, right?
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:07.720]   So with that, I would say that it doesn't matter which field you are in, God created
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.000]   us to cultivate the field.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.440]   But it matters what our motivation is, and who are we really report to, responsible for,
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.920]   who are we really worshipping in our field, right?
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.640]   So we can either murder the shepherd, or we can really worship him, right?
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:31.440]   So that's really what I want to say, it doesn't matter where you are, you can glorify God
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.200]   in the field you're cultivating.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.440]   - Thank you, really encouraging.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:38.200]   Do we have time for one more?
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.200]   Okay, excellent.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:47.280]   Would you speak on how the Lord has been teaching you recently, personally, as much as you feel
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:52.560]   comfortable sharing, and what Bible verses have you been meditating on, and how has the
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.760]   Lord encouraged you recently, we'll start on this side.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.840]   - Recently, I was reading a Bible study on Ephesians.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:05.800]   There is one thing, in Ephesians 1, he said, basically, "Summing up all things in Christ."
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.760]   I was really meditating on that, because this is the eternal plan, before the foundation
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:16.160]   of the world, and till the end of this world, that's God's entire purpose, basically summing
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.120]   up all things on heaven and earth in Christ.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:24.920]   Basically, everything outside of Christ is vanity, nothing important, and God intentionally
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:30.880]   built his church, built his elected people toward that direction, and no matter where
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:38.760]   we are in, we should really align our life with that purpose, and help to share the gospel,
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:43.880]   because that's the only thing that can lead us, lead everyone to that purpose.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:47.560]   Outside of that purpose, we have no purpose, right?
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:56.960]   So I just want to say that Christ is all, and it doesn't matter where we are, and help
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:02.120]   us to really fill other people with Christ, and fill ourself with Christ, and make Christ
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.120]   fill all.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:07.560]   - That focus is so encouraging, and so convicting to me.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.560]   Thank you.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.920]   What about you, Joey?
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:16.680]   - Yeah, like I mentioned, I recently had a daughter, and so I'm a workaholic, by the
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.680]   way.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:22.920]   Ever since I began teaching, I taught at a few other universities than here, I never
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:27.640]   taught the normal teaching load.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.120]   The minimum I taught was like one and a half times.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:36.320]   One time, I was a full-time professor here, full-time another place, full-time seminary
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:39.120]   student, so triple full-time duties.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.280]   Now, okay, I was like about to break down at that point.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:47.240]   I wanted to cry, but I was like, "I don't have time to cry, because I got to do work."
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.040]   But I'm just a natural workaholic.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.960]   I just love to work.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:58.280]   When I had my baby, my love for work or working didn't decrease, but God has given me something
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:03.680]   where the love of my daughter has just so much surpassed it.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.640]   I just want to go home.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:12.440]   But obviously, I am the provider for my family, and really embracing that role was a different
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.880]   level of submission.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:18.040]   When I had marriage counseling, it was actually with Monica and her husband, by the way.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.040]   They counseled me-
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.040]   - Pre-marital counseling.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.040]   They don't need help.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.040]   It's just pre-marital counseling.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.040]   - Yeah, pre-marital.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.760]   - Everybody should be doing when they get married.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.760]   - Yes.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:33.600]   During pre-marital counseling, I learned about submission, loving my wife, things like this.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:39.840]   But I didn't mentally prepare for how much I wanted to be home.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:47.640]   And so right now, the Lord's really teaching me how to just submit to, I guess, like God-ordained
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.960]   role as a provider.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:56.880]   Also, I do work here, so submitting to God-given role was something that I didn't foresee I
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.360]   have to do, but I'm doing it right now.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:03.520]   She's seven months old, and so it's still a work in the process.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:08.280]   We love Joey and Megan and their beautiful family, so it's a privilege to know you guys.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.280]   - Oh, wait.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.720]   There's a Bible verse.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:16.720]   So right now, I'm working through 1 and 2 Samuel in my just daily readings.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:22.840]   And just King David, how his approach to life, you know, I think all of you guys kind of
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:27.240]   know the overall gist, but one thing that the Lord's really been guiding my mind to
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:33.320]   is how much he emphasized the anointed of the Lord when referring to Saul.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:39.000]   And that's the only reason why he didn't kill Saul when he had the chance.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.840]   King David had zero issues with killing people.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.880]   He even killed the servant that killed Saul.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:49.160]   But he killed the servant that killed Saul because that servant killed the anointed of
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.440]   God, and everything for him was really focused on that.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:58.440]   And so that's what the Lord's really been, you know, focusing in my head is everything
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:03.640]   derives from God as a believer, everything should be an act of worship in the similar
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:08.080]   vein that, you know, King David really treated his specific scenario.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:13.840]   - Joey's also my boss, so I have to say something about his leadership.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:17.400]   I mean, it's so obvious that everything is Christ-centered for you, and you always think
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:21.240]   about how to submit all things to Jesus in everything we do.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:26.720]   We always open with prayer, and I just wanted to thank God for your leadership in the Engineering
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.520]   Computer Science Department.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.520]   - Thank you.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.280]   - What about you, Karl?
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:37.160]   - In John 21, we read Jesus' famous sentence, "Follow me."
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:42.320]   If you read John 15, there we read about what it means to remain in Christ.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:47.680]   And if you go way back to Genesis, the Lord called Abram, said, "Hey, leave Ur and go
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.440]   to the place where I want to be you."
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:55.280]   So these kind of connections I'm going through right now, I will graduate seminary in one
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:01.880]   year, I left all those, for now, this kind of medical career behind me, and people said,
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:06.880]   "You are such a foolish, you spend so much time, now you're going to study the Bible."
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.160]   I always said, "No, I'm not losing anything, I'm gaining more."
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:16.080]   I don't know what exactly, but I know even if I don't have the means, the Lord will provide
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.840]   if He wants me to be at some place.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:22.200]   So my prayer is just, "Lord, I want to follow you."
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:27.320]   It's not the what and the where, because whatever and wherever, it's about your glory.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:32.000]   So give me the wisdom to be ready to follow and to remain in you, whatever the future
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.720]   will bring, with the knowledge that you will provide for everything I need.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.160]   That's what I'm thinking about.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.160]   - Wow.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:42.320]   You're the opposite of the rich young ruler who would refuse to let his riches go to follow
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.320]   Christ.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.960]   So that's just so encouraging.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:47.640]   I think we all have that to a certain extent in our lives.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.880]   So we appreciate the encouragement.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:50.880]   Andre?
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:56.320]   - Yeah, I guess a sort of philosophical dilemma that I've been having over the last maybe
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:00.680]   year, year and a half is the whole, "Blessed are the peacemakers," right?
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:05.400]   So as we kind of go through this life, and God opens up new doors, to chairship, or then
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:10.320]   maybe deanship, and beyond, a provost, or whatever else, and some other opportunities
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.880]   in research and grants and all this stuff, in the end, what is the point behind all of
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.880]   it?
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.080]   What is the meaning behind all of this, right?
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.960]   It's a philosophical dilemma.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.120]   But also, "Blessed are the peacemakers," because of everything that's going on in Ukraine,
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:25.560]   and it really made me think about different things.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:26.840]   The peace is not there.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.600]   The whole world is looking for peace, but the peace is clearly not there.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.240]   I mean, in Congo, there's war.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.240]   In Sudan, there's war.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:37.080]   In Yemen, in Ukraine, and all sorts of places, there's war all the time, even though people
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.080]   are looking for peace.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:42.520]   And then it kind of made me realize that there was a time in history when Pilate sends Jesus
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:46.640]   to Herod, two heathens, don't even believe in anything Jesus has to say.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.560]   One just wants to see miracles, the other one's like, "Well, I don't know.
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:53.240]   He's an innocent man, and I know you're just jealous of him," and all this stuff.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:58.480]   One heathen sends Jesus to the other heathen, and they became friends, and it made me really
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.480]   think about this stuff.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:04.640]   So as Christians, so more, we should be sending Jesus to all these places where the war is,
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.640]   and I think that's the ultimate goal behind all of it.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:09.680]   Anyway, the thing that I've been thinking about is, "Blessed are the peacemakers," and
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:16.200]   if two unbelievers could become friends because of Jesus, then why can't the rest of us, professing
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:20.840]   Christians, also get along, especially as I read some stuff on the Ukrainian and Russian
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:27.000]   side, and speaking both languages, and I don't know, I think, "Blessed are the peacemakers,"
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.480]   and that's one thing I've been thinking about quite a bit.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:33.240]   And then how do you bring that peace to a lot of people on the planet Earth?
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:37.440]   You are from a country that no longer exists, like I've heard you say before.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.160]   Which country is it now where you were born?
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:44.920]   Yeah, so now it is Ukraine, but I think I was sharing this in the breakfast earlier,
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:49.120]   so my great-grandfather, obviously don't come from a family of Christians, my great-grandfather
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.500]   fought for the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:54.960]   His kids were Polish because the Austro-Hungarian Empire fell apart from World War I, became
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.440]   part of Poland.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:03.720]   Then in 1953, our part of Poland was given to Ukraine, so we became Soviet.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:07.320]   Then I became Ukrainian, and my kids were born in America.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:13.760]   Alright, so five generations, five countries, and let's see, Austro-Hungary no longer exists,
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:20.200]   Soviet Union no longer exists, so yeah, I mean, what am I?
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:24.440]   You know, the way I see it is, people ask me, "Which president are you voting for?"
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:29.520]   and all this stuff, and I'm like, I live in a theocracy, like I live under a king, I don't
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:34.520]   understand, I don't vote for a king, he's there, you know, Jesus is the king, and hopefully
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.520]   you got the reference.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:43.320]   Anyway, so I was born in the Soviet Union, I guess, but yeah, no, I am a citizen of the
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:46.560]   heavenly world, all of this is very temporary.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.080]   If I could share something from quantum mechanics, I apologize, I don't want to—
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:54.560]   Well, we owe you some time because you didn't answer the first question, but go ahead.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:55.560]   Oh, I did not?
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.560]   How did you come to learn?
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:00.520]   It's okay, you can replace it if you want to talk about quantum.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:04.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, so from quantum physics, I'll just briefly talk about this.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.520]   Time doesn't exist.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:10.720]   I was sitting in the class under— I know, I know, bear with me, I was sitting in the
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.920]   class with this, he's a professor of quantum physics, Professor Najib is his name, he works
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:19.240]   with David Doitch, and if you follow quantum physics, David Doitch is sort of the name
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:22.160]   in the field of quantum physics, right, so one of his collaborators from Oxford came
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:26.080]   to Johns Hopkins, he was teaching a class, and he's like, "We don't need a book, books
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:30.080]   are redundant, we don't need no books," and we're like, "Okay," he's like, "Time doesn't
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.080]   exist."
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:35.880]   So anyway, long story short, I finally found a book by this Professor Griffith, he's from
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:40.320]   University of Michigan if I'm not mistaken, but one of the things they talk about, they
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:45.440]   say, "Look, if you start thinking too much about the problem of time, the problem of
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:48.960]   the fact that we don't really exist unless there's a conscious observer," I'm talking
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:52.160]   purely quantum physics here, "unless there's a conscious observer 24/7, we don't really
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.160]   exist."
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.960]   So then the question is, who's the conscious observer?
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:58.760]   The argument today is, well, you're the conscious observer, okay, that's fine, what about before
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:02.800]   the mind came to be, who's the conscious observer, right?
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:06.920]   And Professor Griffith says this comment, he says, "Well, just don't contemplate these
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:13.280]   things, just kind of accept it," and I'm like, "Well, that's very not scientific of you."
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:17.640]   But you know, so time is very temporal, and time doesn't really exist in the way that
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.880]   we think of time, right, so then we have to think about it from the perspective of what
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:25.000]   really matters if you take the time away, right, and I think it's how much we actually
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.040]   put towards the service of God.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:30.920]   And as far as if I go back to my conversion, a very long story, but anyway, long story
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:38.400]   short, I had to leave my house, tell you another day, I apologize, it's just too difficult,
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.480]   so yeah.
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:49.520]   I just love your gift of taking crazy intelligent stuff and connecting with apologetics, and
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:53.720]   your mission is so clear, everything that you're doing, everything that you're thinking
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:59.600]   is like, "How can I challenge people intellectually so I can flip the world upside down and they
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.960]   can be ready to see how foolish they are and they receive the gospel?"
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:08.080]   So I'm so encouraged by that.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:13.080]   Part of having this conversation was to start a discussion, a broader discussion amongst
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:17.840]   all of you, so we're hoping during lunchtime you'll share your testimonies, you'll share
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:23.000]   your stories of how the Lord has worked in your lives in similar ways that we've shown
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.920]   here in this discussion.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:33.400]   And before we go and take a break, we'll ask Dr. Dewey to please pray for us if he's here.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.720]   Thank you.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.200]   And let's thank our panelists.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:48.880]   - Okay, let's pray.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.960]   Dear Father, I just want to thank you so much for this conference, Lord, and for this institute
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:54.960]   that's in development.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:00.000]   Lord, what a treat it is for us to be together with others with interest in the STEM fields
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   and practices in the STEM fields.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:11.400]   Lord, this is a neat time for us to get together, to enjoy fellowship, Lord, and to share lives
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.760]   with one another.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.560]   Father, we just thank you for all that you've done.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.360]   We want to remind ourselves and each other that you are the reason that we're here.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:26.120]   It is our devotion to you and our love of you that drives our lives.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:30.280]   And Lord, we just pray that you would bless this fellowship as we spend time together
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.720]   in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.720]   Amen.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.720]   - Amen.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:34.720]   - Amen.
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:34.720]   - Amen.
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:35.720]   - Amen.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.720]   - Amen.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:36.720]   - Amen.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:46.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
