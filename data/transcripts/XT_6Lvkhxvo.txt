[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.520]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.740]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.440]   My guest today is Dr. Becky Kennedy.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.960]   Dr. Becky Kennedy is a clinical psychologist
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.200]   specializing in parent-child relationships.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.480]   She received her degrees and did her training
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.080]   at Duke University and Columbia University in New York.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.120]   She is the author of the bestselling book, "Good Inside,"
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.700]   a guide to becoming the parent you want to be.
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.120]   She is also the founder and creator
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.800]   of an online learning platform, also called Good Inside,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.360]   at which parents and parents-to-be
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.960]   can learn the best possible parenting skills
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.340]   that are grounded in the fields of clinical psychology,
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.760]   that have been proven to work in the real world,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.800]   and that can allow people to navigate common sticking points
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.800]   in parent-child relationships.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.860]   During today's discussion,
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.920]   you will learn a tremendous amount of actionable knowledge
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.520]   about what it is to be a good parent.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.240]   This is a conversation that pertains not just to parents
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.680]   and parents-to-be, but also uncles, aunts, grandparents,
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.360]   and also those of you not planning to
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.600]   or who do not want children.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.400]   I say that because while everything we discussed today
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.000]   is grounded in the discussion
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.920]   around parent-child relationships,
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.880]   it indeed pertains to all of us
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.600]   and relationships of all kinds,
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.960]   including romantic relationships, friendships,
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.560]   workplace relationships, and our relationship to self.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.920]   Dr. Kennedy defines for us and makes clear and actionable
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.320]   what the exact job of good parenting is
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.420]   and how that relates to other relationships
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.540]   that we might have.
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.560]   She explains how to set healthy boundaries,
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560]   and in fact, defines exactly what healthy boundaries are.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.600]   There's a lot of misconception about that.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.480]   We also talk a lot about empathy
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.720]   and the need to make children and ourselves feel safe
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.120]   in all kinds of relating.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.280]   We discuss how to navigate disagreements and arguments,
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.040]   apologies and punishments, reward, and on and on,
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.240]   all framed within a real-world, real-time context.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.800]   What I mean by that, and what I think really sets apart
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.360]   Dr. Becky Kennedy's work from so much else
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.040]   that you'll see out there on parent-child
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.560]   and other types of relationships,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.760]   is that she makes what to do and say
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.840]   and what not to do and say
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.920]   in a variety of real-world contexts very clear,
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.040]   such that you can access that knowledge
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.240]   and do those specific things and avoid those specific things
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.280]   even when things get tense.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.760]   In fact, especially when things get difficult or tense.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.880]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.160]   you will have learned a dozen or more
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.260]   very potent clinically-backed tools
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.380]   to navigate parent-child relating,
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.020]   including your relationship to your own parents,
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.240]   alive or dead, and your relationship to self.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.080]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.800]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.940]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.840]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.860]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.320]   to the general public.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.440]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.360]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.200]   Our first sponsor is Matina.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.580]   Matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink yerba mate.
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.640]   I often discuss yerba mate's benefits,
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.180]   such as regulating blood sugar,
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.600]   its high antioxidant content,
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.880]   the ways that it can improve digestion,
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.080]   and possible neuroprotective effects.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.700]   I also drink yerba mate because I love the taste.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.040]   While there are a lot of different choices
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.060]   of yerba mate drinks out there,
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.240]   I love Matina because, again,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.280]   they have the no sugar variety,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.520]   as well as the fact that both their loose leaf
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.120]   and their canned varieties
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.560]   are of the absolute best quality,
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.640]   so much so that I decided to become
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.360]   a partial owner in the company.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.720]   Although I must say,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.020]   even if they hadn't allowed me to do that,
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.400]   I would be drinking Matina.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.200]   It is the cleanest tasting and best yerba mate you can find.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.480]   I love the taste of brewed loose leaf Matina yerba mate,
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.920]   and I particularly love the taste
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.400]   of Matina's new canned cold brew zero sugar yerba mate,
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.160]   which I personally help them develop.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.660]   If you'd like to try Matina,
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.140]   go to www.drinkmatina.com/huberman.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.800]   Right now, Matina is offering a free one pound bag
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.860]   of loose leaf yerba mate tea and free shipping
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.280]   with the purchase of two cases
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.120]   of their cold brew yerba mate.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.560]   Again, that's www.drinkmatina.com/huberman
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.200]   to get the free bag of yerba mate loose leaf tea
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.500]   and free shipping.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.380]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.680]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.840]   Now, if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.900]   on this podcast,
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.480]   it's the incredible role that light can have on our biology.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.000]   And of course, I'm always telling people
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.560]   that they should get sunlight in their eyes
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.040]   as soon as possible after waking
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.500]   on as many days of their life as possible
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.000]   for sake of setting circadian rhythm,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.120]   daytime mood focus and alertness, and improve sleep.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.920]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.700]   red light and near infrared light
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.120]   has been shown to have positive effects
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.480]   on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ health,
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.880]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.000]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.740]   even improvements in acne, or that is removal of acne,
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.500]   reducing pain and inflammation,
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.360]   improving mitochondrial function,
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.900]   and even improving vision itself.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.880]   What sets Juve apart
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.240]   and why it's my preferred red light therapy device
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.140]   is that it has clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.940]   meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.180]   and near infrared light in combination
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.000]   that trigger the optimal cellular adaptations.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.160]   Personally, I use the handheld Juve every day.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.880]   The handheld Juve is about the size of a thick piece of toast
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.480]   and I also own a Juve panel
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.840]   that allows for full body exposure
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.140]   and I use that one approximately five times per week
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.440]   for about 10 to 15 minutes per session.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.880]   If you would like to try Juve,
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.080]   you can go to juve.com/huberman
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.920]   to receive $50 off your first purchase.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.520]   Again, that's juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.320]   to get $50 off your first purchase.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.260]   Today's episode is also brought to us by AeroPress.
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.280]   AeroPress is similar to a French press for making coffee,
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.380]   but is in fact a much better way to make coffee.
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.060]   I first learned about AeroPress well over 10 years ago
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.100]   and I've been using one ever since.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.820]   AeroPress was developed by Alan Adler,
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.800]   who was an engineer at Stanford.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.520]   And I knew of Alan because he had also built
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.420]   the so-called Aerobie Frisbee.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.320]   So he was sort of famous in our community
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.200]   for developing these different feats of engineering
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.040]   that turned into commercial products.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.140]   Now, I love coffee.
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.280]   I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day,
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.600]   usually about 90 to 120 minutes
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.520]   after I wake up in the morning, although not always.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.080]   Sometimes if I'm going to exercise,
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.440]   I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning,
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.960]   but I love, love, love coffee.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.940]   And what I've personally found is that by using the AeroPress
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.840]   I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.680]   I don't know what exactly it is in the AeroPress
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.360]   that allows the same beans to be prepared
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.580]   into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.320]   as compared to any other form of brewing that coffee,
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.440]   even the traditional French press.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.640]   The AeroPress is extremely easy to use
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.560]   and it's extremely compact.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.600]   In fact, I take it with me whenever I travel
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.960]   and I use it on the road in hotels, even on planes.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.120]   I'll just ask for some hot water
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.740]   and I'll brew my coffee or tea right there on the plane.
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.480]   With over 55,000 five-star reviews,
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.960]   AeroPress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.540]   If you would like to try AeroPress,
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.940]   you can go to aeropress.com/huberman.

[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.880]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Becky Kennedy.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.340]   Dr. Becky Kennedy, welcome.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.720]   - Thank you, so excited to be here.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.400]   I have a lot of questions for you.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.680]   And as I mentioned in my introduction,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.960]   much of what we are going to discuss today
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.460]   relates to parent-child relating,
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.600]   but pertains to relationships generally.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.680]   So people with children, without children,
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.940]   who don't want children,
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.480]   hopefully there aren't people that hate children,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.140]   but for all people out there with children or not,
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.200]   planning them or not,
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.180]   relationships are really just fundamental to who we are.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.340]   And I actually place relationships,
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.420]   including relationship to self,
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.240]   in what we now think of as the six pillars
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.280]   of mental health, physical health, and performance,
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.900]   sleep, nutrition, exercise,
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.760]   relationships clearly vital to all aspects of life.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.760]   So I'd like to start off by just asking for all of us,
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.600]   are there some simple or perhaps not so simple questions
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.640]   that we can reflect on that give us a sense
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.900]   of how good a parent we are or would be
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.380]   based on, I don't know,
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.180]   our previous parent-child relationships,
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.960]   our relationship to self.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.740]   What kind of things come to bear
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.120]   when we think about really healthy relationships?
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.000]   I can start rattling off a list
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.740]   of what I imagine they could be,
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.120]   but what are your thoughts?
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.700]   What's the parameter space, as we say?
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.960]   How should we think about relationships besides just,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.760]   oh, I either like this person or don't,
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.240]   or I feel good around them or I don't,
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.300]   or separating how I feel about them
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.920]   versus how they make me feel.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.320]   Maybe we can drill a little deeper
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.480]   below the kind of more superficial stuff
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.120]   that we often see out there.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.880]   - The first thing that comes to mind when you say that
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.000]   is this word sturdiness.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.560]   And to me, when someone says,
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.960]   what is good inside as an approach?
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.120]   And that's always the first word that comes to mind.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.120]   And I know that's an odd word.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.360]   It's not a word we use a lot.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.380]   Although I do think most people,
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.720]   when you say that person's a really sturdy person,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.680]   I think we all have some connotation or feeling,
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.920]   at least, of what that means.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.080]   And I use it a lot, being a sturdy parent,
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.080]   being a sturdy leader.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.460]   I talk a lot about the similarities to parenting
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.840]   and kind of being a pilot of a plane.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.640]   And that word sturdy always comes up.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.920]   And so I remember a little while ago,
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.760]   someone pushed me, they're like,
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.560]   what's your definition of what that means?
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.480]   And at that point, I thought, wow,
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.240]   I should probably have a definition given I use it a lot.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.780]   But what I think it really means is inability
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.660]   to be connected to yourself
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.160]   and to someone else at the same time.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.680]   And I think that is really the definition
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.760]   of sturdy leadership.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.520]   And that is the key thing that's present
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.920]   in a healthy relationship.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.200]   That at once, I kind of know my values,
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.840]   what I want, what I need.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.560]   I feel like I can be true to that.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:23.160]   And at the same time, I can kind of connect to someone else
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.560]   who probably has different wants and needs
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.920]   and maybe even slightly different values at the same time.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.480]   And the thing that leads me to next
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   is what I think about is like family jobs and a parent job.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:41.080]   So in almost any other place, you could assume
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.160]   if I'm getting a new job at this company,
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.140]   like there's just no way I could do my job well
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.480]   if I don't know what my job is, right?
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.960]   If you go to your desk and your boss is like,
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.360]   have a good day, do a good job,
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.500]   and there's no job description,
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.960]   you'd be like, I think that's impossible.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.520]   But over and over with parents, if I say to them,
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.740]   well, what is your job with your kid?
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.560]   Or when your kid is having a tantrum or they hit
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.480]   or they're rude or they lie to your face or anything,
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.600]   what is your job in that moment?
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.640]   Most people, very well-intentioned, educated people
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.220]   who would never, ever take a job
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.000]   if they didn't have a job description,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.240]   they look at me, they're like, I have no idea.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.680]   So how can we do it well?
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.440]   How can we then perform it to a place
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.880]   to get to the outcomes we want
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.980]   if you don't have the foundation of what your job is?
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.840]   And to me, I thought a lot about it.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.460]   I think parents actually have two jobs
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.200]   and it relates to sturdiness, so you'll connect it.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.880]   Where one of our jobs is boundaries.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.880]   And to me, boundaries are things we tell people we will do
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.800]   and they require the other person to do nothing.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.220]   And that's like really important.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.320]   'Cause a lot of times we think we're setting a boundary
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.480]   when actually we're making a request.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.640]   And boundaries keep us connected to ourselves.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.380]   They represent our values and our wants and our needs.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.700]   And in a parent-child relationship,
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.820]   they also keep our kids safe.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.140]   If I just know in a simple way,
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.940]   like my kids watched enough TV today
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.240]   and they really have to get to bed.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.080]   And I know that, like, I don't want them to stay up late.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.300]   I kind of know what my family needs.
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.200]   I have to set a boundary.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.540]   But the other part of my job is empathy and validation,
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.480]   which is a way of connecting to someone else
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.600]   where you see someone else's feelings
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.020]   and experience as real.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.340]   You don't agree with it, probably.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.540]   You don't necessarily condone the behavior.
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.600]   That's the representation of the feelings.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.660]   But the feelings themselves, you need to connect to.
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.680]   And I feel like those are our two jobs as parents.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.740]   And that's really the way to be a sturdy leader
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.340]   and to be in a sturdy, healthy relationship with your kids.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.460]   - Wow.
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.160]   So much there and I love it.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.600]   And here's one of the reasons I love it.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.300]   This notion of sturdiness,
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.740]   something that I don't think we hear enough about.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.760]   We hear about resilience, grit, also important terms.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.300]   But sturdiness, as you've described it,
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.060]   and the job of parenting really seems
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:10.060]   to include a lot of verbs, not just nouns and adjectives.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.740]   And I'm a huge fan of verbs because biology
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.540]   and to some extent psychology, yes, also psychology,
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.620]   is all about verbs.
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.560]   And so the labels often are mysterious,
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.620]   but sturdiness just sends a clear message
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.380]   of something that doesn't budge easily.
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.880]   But then as you described the job
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.760]   of being a parent having boundaries,
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.500]   and I'd like to drill into that a little bit more
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.540]   how you view boundaries, but also empathy.
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.760]   It's not a walled off picture.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.420]   It's one that is semi-permeable.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.700]   Also, and I confess I'm a bit obsessed
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.380]   with old school psychoanalytic theory,
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.320]   not as the be all end all of psychology,
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.320]   but it also suggests like this other relationship.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.740]   Like I'm a person, I have a self,
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.540]   you're a person, you have a self.
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.580]   This is the opposite of codependency
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.860]   where obviously dependency
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.820]   and two people being quote unquote codependent
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.620]   can be healthy in the context of relying on one another.
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.120]   But as I understand it, when one person has a self
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.540]   and another person doesn't have a self,
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.300]   or this notion of merging,
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.980]   not just in romantic relationships,
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.900]   but child-parent relationships,
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.980]   I'm best friends with my mom or dad.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.040]   Is that a good thing?
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.880]   I don't know.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.040]   But this notion of other other relationships,
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.320]   it's like I'm a self, you're a self,
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.960]   and we each see each other as another.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:38.320]   Anyway, I think there's so much to explore here, so valuable.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.560]   You mentioned that boundaries are something that we do
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.220]   and that requires that the other do nothing.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.480]   Can we go a little bit further into that?
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.040]   Because it's a beautiful concept
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.720]   and this notion of boundaries,
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.740]   but like a gaslighting narcissism
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.400]   and all the other things that we hear about nowadays,
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.060]   I think is often badly misunderstood.
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.540]   So tell us more about boundaries
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.300]   and how that looks in the action sense of it.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.040]   - And this is all so connected to what you're saying,
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.500]   that other other relationship.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.920]   I'm a person, you're a person.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.600]   And so many times that's actually is what gets merged.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.740]   And so my kid gets upset that I say
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.740]   they can't watch another show.
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.040]   And a parent really in that moment,
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.440]   it's like whose feelings are whose?
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.880]   They were upset, was I was upset?
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.020]   A second ago, I thought I should set the boundary.
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.600]   And now all of a sudden I'm changing my mind.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.480]   There is this complete role kind of confusion and merger,
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.260]   which is one of the main reasons
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.680]   that kids get actually really scared
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.760]   and escalate their behavior
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.800]   'cause they don't have a sturdy leader
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.960]   when they really need one, right?
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.960]   So boundaries are what we tell someone we will do
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.920]   and they require the other person to do nothing.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.560]   I like this definition for a lot of reasons.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.560]   I'm just very practical.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.800]   So it allows me after I set a boundary to like assess,
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.840]   was that a boundary or not, right?
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.120]   Because let's take the TV example.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.320]   It's whatever time at night,
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.960]   my kid has just watched a show
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.560]   and they know they're supposed to watch one show
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.660]   and then turn off the TV.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.340]   I hear from parents a lot, my kid doesn't listen
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.280]   or my kid doesn't respect my boundaries.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.720]   And I'll say, okay, that sounds hard, let's get into that.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.440]   So then I'll say, so I told my kid to shut off the TV.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.440]   They just kept watching, they just kept on.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.720]   I told my kid to stop jumping on the couch
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.200]   and they kept jumping.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.800]   They don't respect my boundaries, they don't listen.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.800]   To me, this is like a beautiful example
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.360]   of like this is a problem, I agree,
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.400]   but this is not a boundary problem.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.980]   You made a request of your child.
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.680]   And frankly, if you have your,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.480]   I'm making this up, seven-year-old watching TV,
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.320]   I'm not so good at putting away TV and a phone at night.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.660]   Like it's just hard for me to do.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.080]   So your seven-year-old probably is just addicted
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.280]   to what's ever happening.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.020]   And we're kind of asking our kid to do our job for us
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.540]   because we don't want our kid to be mad at us
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.680]   or whatever it is.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.760]   A boundary in that situation would be saying,
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.180]   oh, you didn't put off the TV.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.040]   Look, by the time I get over there,
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.800]   if you haven't turned off the TV,
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.480]   and I don't wanna do this, but I will,
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.740]   I will take the remote out of your hand and shut it off.
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.140]   A boundary is saying, oh, after my request doesn't work,
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.280]   can you get off the couch, you can jump on the floor.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.620]   Look, if by the time I get over there,
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.320]   you haven't gotten off the couch, I will pick you up.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.940]   That is, I always say, I'm not gonna put the success
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.640]   of my intervention in my like seven-year-old's hand.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.960]   I care too much about my own needs and my own role
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.960]   as a leader in my home to do that, right?
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.000]   Same thing with, let's say, in-laws.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.640]   My mother-in-law doesn't respect my boundary.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.360]   She always shows up without calling.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.520]   Now, I don't wanna get to this point,
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.000]   and there's a lot of things in a relationship
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.880]   we can do before we get to this point,
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.560]   but if that's really a boundary,
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.520]   and I have a very kind of intrusive mother-in-law,
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.960]   a boundary would be saying, look,
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.140]   this is gonna be awkward, and I know you mean well,
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.480]   but the next time you come unannounced,
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.400]   I will come to your car and say,
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.520]   oh, this time doesn't work for us.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.660]   You cannot come in, and I will go back into my house
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.080]   and close the door.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.400]   Like, now, there's gonna be lots of feelings around that,
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.840]   but you are now setting a true boundary,
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.380]   and when we say our kids don't listen,
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.640]   those are often situations, not all of them,
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.040]   but there's a big percentage where I'm actually not setting
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.560]   a boundary early enough and in a sturdy enough way,
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.000]   which is what my kid needs, because at that point,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.440]   they simply don't have the skills to inhibit and urge,
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.040]   and they need me to be the boundary for them.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.440]   - We hear sometimes that kids are craving rules.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.000]   They're craving boundaries.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.040]   I don't know, I was kind of a wild adolescent and teenager,
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.920]   maybe a little more than wild.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.500]   I don't recall ever craving rules,
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.600]   but I do recall paying attention
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.080]   to their lack of presence.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.160]   So what of that?
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.080]   Is this notion that kids really want
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.400]   and crave rules and boundaries,
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.240]   is that sort of, I don't know,
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.460]   projection that we put onto them?
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.720]   And I'm not exploring this just for fun.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.240]   I'm exploring it because I think that one thing
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.280]   that's very helpful in setting boundaries,
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.460]   especially with kids, is the idea that, gosh,
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.000]   even if it's a bit painful to see them in discomfort,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.160]   there's that empathy piece that you talked about before,
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.600]   that empathic attunement
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.800]   can get in the way of boundaries.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.100]   They're not mutually exclusive,
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.120]   but these are somewhat competing forces at times.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.260]   So if we know, or if we can acknowledge,
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.560]   or at least explore this idea
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.560]   that rules are deep down what they really want,
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.800]   not just what they need, maybe it would help.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.360]   - Yes, and I think, by the way,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.800]   in my taking the remote away,
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.360]   or taking my kid off the couch, just to be clear,
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.840]   if I do that to my kid, they are not gonna say,
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.120]   "Oh, mom, you are the best mom in the world, thank you."
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.720]   They are gonna cry and scream.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.740]   And that's where boundaries and empathy,
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.240]   those two parts of our job, actually do always go together.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.440]   I think they're actually partners.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.640]   They're not actually at odds,
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.120]   because as soon as my kid is upset,
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.160]   what I would say to them is,
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.160]   "Oh, he wanted to jump on the couch.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.420]   "It's not as much fun on the floor.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.580]   "Oh, he really wanted to watch another show.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.060]   "You didn't even want it this big.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.280]   "You wanted to watch it this big."
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.220]   It sounds crazy 'cause you're like,
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.020]   "Wait, why am I empathizing with that feeling?"
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.280]   They just kind of disobeyed.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.320]   No, they're two different things.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.320]   I'm doing my job and setting a boundary.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.480]   They're actually doing their job
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.600]   and feeling their feelings.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.740]   That's actually their job.
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.640]   The only way you can ever learn to regulate a feeling
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.400]   is through feeling the feeling.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.100]   So they're doing their job.
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.240]   Now I'm gonna validate.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.280]   And this is how kids learn emotion regulation.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.200]   Boundaries, they feel, I validate,
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.960]   I hold the boundary over and over and over.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.920]   So do kids crave rules?
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.840]   And I think one of the issues
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.500]   is that most parenting approaches have one or the other.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.300]   And I think they're both very incomplete strategies.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.940]   If you just lead with rules, right?
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.380]   I don't know who said it, definitely wasn't me.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.220]   Like, what is it?
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.300]   Rules without relationship lead to rebellion.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.760]   Yeah, that's what happens, right?
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.320]   So that's not good.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.620]   But I see the stainage, we've swung the other direction.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.040]   It is also not a complete parenting strategy
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.220]   when your kid's jumping on the couch to do nothing
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.060]   if you think that's dangerous and to say,
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.380]   "Oh, you really wanna jump, jump, jump
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.660]   "and such big feelings."
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.300]   Like that's not what kids need.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.640]   I think kids crave boundaries
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.300]   and they crave feeling seen and understood.
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.720]   Because as kids are growing up,
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.640]   like I think the questions they're always asking parents,
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.340]   even though of course they never say this,
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.220]   it's just, am I real and am I safe?
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.380]   Every interaction, that's what they're asking us.
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.880]   The reason we have to validate their feelings
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.720]   when they're upset, even though they're so upset
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.580]   just that their string cheese broke, whatever it is,
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.980]   is feelings don't have markers like blood
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.340]   or like they don't know.
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.540]   And so when we say, "Oh, you wanted your string cheese
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.240]   "to be together," what we're really saying
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.240]   is the things you experience inside of you are real.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.500]   But kids are also desperate to know like,
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.980]   how far do things go?
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.860]   No one likes to feel boundary-less as a kid.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.820]   That's terrifying, right?
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:00.340]   And so when we set a boundary, we actually say to a kid,
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.640]   like, "I will always protect you.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.160]   "Like, I won't let things get so far out of control."
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.380]   So I do think, I don't know if it's rules,
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.080]   but kids crave connection.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.000]   And I think boundaries and kind of validation and empathy,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.120]   they are the two forms of connection
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.260]   that kids, yeah, are really desperate for.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.600]   - What about rewarding kids?
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.080]   And here, rather than start off by asking,
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.240]   what are the best ways to reward kids and healthy ways?
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.940]   I will ask that in a moment.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.080]   How can we evaluate the notion of rewards or incentives
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:43.940]   through this lens of sturdiness, boundaries, and empathy?
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.140]   - Yeah.
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:50.140]   - Because I could imagine a reward that's outsized
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.600]   in comparison to what a kid did.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.320]   Okay, great, you took your plate
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.640]   to the kitchen sink after dinner.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.100]   You get $10,000, obviously, out of scale, extreme example,
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.980]   but just by way of example,
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:09.120]   screw up their reward mechanisms for life, if you ask me,
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.740]   that everything I know about reward in neuroplasticity says
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.040]   that that would occur.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.820]   But this idea that you can incentivize kids,
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.500]   if you turn off the TV now,
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.760]   then you definitely can watch tomorrow night.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.360]   Whereas if you don't, you can't.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.640]   So you're sort of merging reward and potential punishment.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.480]   How do we bound rewards?
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.700]   And how do we take into account
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.100]   that when we start adding rewards to scenarios
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.520]   that we're mixing and matching life experience for them?
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.600]   Okay, so now doing what I'm told,
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.940]   do I always expect a reward?
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.940]   If the reward doesn't come next time,
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.680]   we know based on reward prediction error,
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.860]   we tend to be worse off emotionally
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.960]   than had we never received a reward in the first place.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.000]   Again, pretty vast parameter space,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.740]   but what are your thoughts on best ways
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.760]   to reward kids for standard good behavior
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.760]   versus achievement versus elimination of bad behavior?
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.780]   So three categories.
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.900]   - I think you're asking a much bigger question,
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.660]   Ramana, I think you are,
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:19.660]   which is like, why do parents think we need to reward kids?
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.480]   I think that's, why do we think we need to punish kids?
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.240]   And this is actually where everything I work on started from
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.680]   because the way I was trained to work with parents,
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.240]   I went to the best gold standard evidence-based program,
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.580]   and it was all about timeouts and punishments
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.340]   and rewards and stickers and ignoring and praise,
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.460]   and honestly, during the training for the years
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.600]   after I kind of practiced this way,
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.620]   I feel like that, you know this better than I am,
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:45.540]   so I shouldn't even say this,
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.940]   but like that left part of my brain,
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.820]   like logic and linearity, I was just like, this is amazing.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.760]   Oh my goodness, we're gonna get more of the good behavior
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.920]   and we're gonna not get the bad behavior.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.080]   And I'd start teaching this
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.780]   to parents in my private practice,
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.620]   and there was this little thing in me,
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.460]   I don't even know, I was like, I don't know about this.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.180]   I don't know, and it get louder and louder
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.220]   to the point that in a session,
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.900]   I literally said to a parent in front of me,
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.820]   I was just like telling them how to do a timeout,
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:14.660]   and I said, I'm sorry,
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.620]   I don't believe anything I've been telling you.
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.740]   That's literally what I said,
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.120]   'cause I just, it was so loud,
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.900]   and it was obviously super awkward,
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.300]   but it led me to, I feel like
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.600]   from this first principles way,
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.500]   be like, there are a million assumptions
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.300]   that we have about raising kids,
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.600]   and I think about relationships,
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.780]   and if I just strip them back,
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.700]   what do I be left with,
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.820]   and what would be a new building from there?
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.860]   And rewards and like punishments to me
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.140]   are these assumptions that we have somehow converted
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:44.060]   from like the fiction shelf of the library in my mind
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.140]   to like the nonfiction shelf as like truths,
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.100]   and I kind of rail against all of them.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.460]   So I think the question,
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.660]   if that's okay to go in that direction,
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.280]   to me is like, why do we think we need to reward kids,
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.160]   and is there actually a better system,
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.040]   both short-term and long-term?
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.780]   I'm incredibly long-term greedy in my parenting approach,
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.460]   'cause at the end of the day,
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.840]   18 and up is where things really matter.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.320]   Not really matter, I mean, they all matter,
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.640]   but I'd rather, you know,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.620]   I wanna help my kids become sturdy, resilient adults,
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.280]   but I'm short-term greedy too, 'cause I'm a realist.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.580]   Like I just can't deal with like
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.300]   all of these difficult moments.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.120]   You get both for sure without rewards and punishments.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.200]   So I don't know,
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.860]   what might someone tell me they give a reward for?
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.740]   Do you wanna use the like clearing the table or example?
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.840]   Let's start that there.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.280]   It kind of goes back to like,
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.420]   believing kids are inherently good inside.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.700]   I really think it goes back to that.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.680]   If you really believe kids are inherently good inside,
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.620]   which by the way, when I strip back every assumption,
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.440]   the only thing I was left was that,
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.800]   literally the only thing.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.420]   And then I started to think, okay,
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.320]   so if they're good inside,
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.040]   why do they do so many annoying things like all the time?
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.040]   But that gave me a gap.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.800]   And I feel like that is very exciting to have a gap.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.280]   Like why do people who are good inside
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.720]   do such bad things, right?
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.440]   Adults or kids.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.400]   And to me, right, kids are born with all the feelings
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.220]   and none of the skills to manage those feelings.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.060]   Like period.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.760]   And we've often thought, therefore, when feelings,
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.180]   feelings without skills come out in behaviors.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.040]   I think that's what bad behaviors are.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.320]   Feelings or urges or something without a skill
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.800]   to manage them or without access to the skill,
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.780]   might be in that moment, either way.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.080]   And then we end up punishing behavior,
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:31.000]   but the behavior was just a sign of the lack of skill.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.200]   So I can't imagine anyone thinking
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.600]   I could teach my kid to swim
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.600]   by punishing them for not swimming.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.840]   Like I think someone would say that was crazy.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.480]   But that's kind of how we raise kids.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.480]   And then we think rewarding them is gonna be effective,
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.480]   but it actually leads over and over to what you said.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.440]   I've seen these parents over and over my private practice.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.440]   My 14 year old literally won't pick up their clothes
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.240]   from the floor unless I give them $5.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.200]   Like, how did I get here?
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.760]   And I'm like, yeah, that's a problem.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.360]   But I saw how they got there.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:05.360]   So let's take clearing their plate.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.880]   I know this is gonna sound cheesy,
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.520]   but kids do have something in them
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.100]   where they wanna feel like a purposeful,
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.920]   meaningful part of society.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.740]   They do.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.280]   Impact drives adults and it drives kids.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.560]   It's not the same type of rewarding as playing Fortnite.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.440]   It's a totally different system.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.520]   But I think the question is like,
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.200]   why do we think we have to bribe kids
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.000]   or kind of trick them into doing things
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.480]   that are kind of like basic parts of human life?
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.600]   And so if we take that and my kid chronically
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.900]   isn't clearing their plate, I could say to them,
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.800]   look, every time you clear a plate,
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.640]   I'm gonna give you a sticker.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.260]   After five stickers, you're gonna get,
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.720]   I don't know, whatever it is.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.960]   To me, like a much more just effective way
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.480]   is I'd say to my kid, hey, I know you know,
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.240]   like clearing a plate is just one way
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.080]   of being part of this family and taking care of stuff.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.960]   I know you know that, we're on the same team.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.120]   I say that phrase, we're on the same team, right, we are.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.060]   Something's getting in your way of remembering.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.460]   I'm gonna assume I like the most generous interpretation.
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.680]   That to me allows you to separate someone's bad behavior
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.160]   from their good identity.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.700]   Then I'm gonna say, what would help you remember?
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:08.800]   We literally did this with my son
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.640]   who always had his towel on the floor.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.680]   And I was just like, I bet he just doesn't remember.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.760]   He literally doesn't see it.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.440]   We talked about it and he's like,
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.740]   we talked about him putting a Post-it, literally.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.960]   Something simple like a Post-it on my door
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.280]   that just says pick up my towel.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.940]   He wrote it in his own handwriting, right,
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.720]   trying to facilitate him like solving his own problems.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.160]   And now he has a much higher rate of picking up his towel.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.400]   Like I guess I could have said,
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.560]   every time you pick up your towel,
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.760]   you'll, I don't know, get a dollar or whatever it is.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.000]   But again, it makes me think,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.320]   I'm not building the generalizable skill that way.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.920]   I'm just kind of offering something at the end,
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.780]   which sets me on this kind of awful cycle
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.680]   that I think kind of misses the point.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.040]   - I'd like to take a brief moment
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.020]   and thank one of our sponsors and that's AG1.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.640]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.920]   that also contains adaptogens.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.040]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.320]   The reason I started taking it
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.120]   and the reason I still take it every day
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.480]   is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.240]   for vitamins and minerals.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.100]   And it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.640]   to support gut health.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.080]   Now, gut health is something that over the last 10 years,
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.080]   we realized is not just important
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.720]   for the health of our gut,
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.880]   but also for our immune system
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.040]   and for the production of neurotransmitters
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.600]   and neuromodulators, things like dopamine and serotonin.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.440]   In other words,
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.440]   gut health is critical for proper brain functioning.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.120]   Now, of course, I strive to consume healthy whole foods
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.560]   for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day,
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.520]   but there are a number of things in AG1,
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.200]   including specific micronutrients
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.760]   that are hard to get from whole foods
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.640]   or at least in sufficient quantities.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.080]   So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.840]   that I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens,
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.840]   and critical micronutrients.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.400]   So anytime somebody asks me
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.560]   if they were to take just one supplement,
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.680]   what that supplement should be, I tell them AG1,
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.000]   because AG1 supports so many different systems
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.180]   within the body that are involved in mental health,
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.800]   physical health, and performance.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.700]   To try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman,
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.840]   and you'll get a year's supply of vitamin D3K2
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.960]   and five free travel packs of AG1.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.960]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.340]   I love the idea that kids want purpose.
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:23.040]   And am I correct in wondering
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.560]   if that goes back to this am I real component
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.240]   of the am I real, am I safe?
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.060]   - Yes.
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.520]   - Like one way that we know we are real
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.440]   is our ability to impart change on the world around us.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.840]   I don't want to get too abstract here,
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.520]   but as a neuroscientist,
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.720]   I've often sat back and reflected
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.880]   like all the emotions we feel,
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.080]   like no one sees that or knows that.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.520]   Unless we say something, we write something,
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.240]   we sing something, we shout something,
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.560]   all the forms of expression,
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.280]   just like none of our dreams,
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:55.200]   our creative insights or wishes exist,
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.920]   except inside us, unless we transmute them
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.020]   into something in the real world.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.040]   So there does seem to be something
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.760]   about having this nervous system
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.720]   from a time we're really on,
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.480]   like it's seeing our effect on the world
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.640]   that really makes us real and on others.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.160]   And I love the idea that, well,
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.800]   and I must say, I absolutely believe in my heart
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.760]   and I just feel it as a feeling
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.080]   that kids are inherently good inside.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.060]   Like I just, I can't imagine any other version of that,
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.060]   but does that mean that there are people out there
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.120]   who believe that kids are inherently bad
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.200]   or at least not good?
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.760]   I mean, like how could that be?
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.720]   But then again, maybe I'm just naive.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.480]   - I don't know if anyone consciously believes that,
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.680]   but when I go back to that system
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.400]   I was first trained in rewards and punishments,
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.300]   like it feels like a system of behavioral control.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.400]   And to me, like I've always thought about control
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.340]   and trust as opposites.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.280]   So I only control what I don't trust.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.240]   So nobody said to me in that program,
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.920]   by the way, Becky, everything you're learning here,
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.200]   we believe kids are bad inside and so we do this thing,
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.220]   but well, if I don't trust my kid
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.500]   and if I don't trust they inherently have the things in them
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.880]   to do good, by the way, that's not gonna happen naturally.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.640]   That's why we have a big job as a parent to coach our kids
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.280]   to bring that out, to set boundaries when they can't do it
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.460]   and so many other things.
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.820]   But I don't believe anyone would say,
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:15.980]   yeah, it's 'cause they're bad inside,
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:19.080]   but there is a nature where you're constantly interacting
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.660]   with your kid from that other system,
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.620]   looking at them like, I don't trust you.
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.020]   I don't trust you and when you do bad things,
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.620]   I cannot hold on to the fact that you have a good identity.
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.680]   That's why I'm giving you a punishment.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.560]   That's why I'm sending you away to your room
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.880]   and so if I'm reflecting back to you constantly
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.740]   that you are just your latest behavior,
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.800]   that I don't trust you, that I kind of have to bribe you
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.560]   to do very basic human things,
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.720]   well, our kids form their identity
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.320]   from our reflection of them
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.520]   and so then this is what really compelled all of this.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.480]   I'm like, we're raising generation after generation of kid
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.600]   kind of saying to them like,
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.400]   you're kind of a bad, untrustworthy kid
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.320]   and then we wonder why we have such high rates
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.760]   of like massive mental health problems.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.800]   Well, there's some linearity there.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.640]   - I'm curious about this notion of impingement.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:14.640]   I've heard about this idea that when we're young,
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.480]   we're forging life deciding,
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.120]   do I like the way this tastes or not tastes?
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.040]   By the way, I still hate anchovies.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.280]   I don't need to be asked again to know the answer,
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.360]   but when you're young,
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.120]   we're encouraged to do things like eat your broccoli,
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.600]   taste the anchovy and some parents,
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.680]   it seems are very comfortable with the idea
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.480]   of allowing their children to have their feelings
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.320]   and their wishes.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.400]   As I always say, the nervous system seems to be divided
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.200]   into yum, yucks and meh, mez.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.360]   I guess the plural will be mez, yum, yucks and mez.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.740]   I mean, it's more complicated than that,
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.840]   but like with people where you're like,
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.280]   yeah, I really like them or no, something's off.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.400]   They're like, meh, you know?
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.240]   So it's not that much more nuanced than that
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.980]   and the brain's got to make decisions after all, excuse me.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:04.300]   So kids have their yums, yucks and mez,
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:08.780]   and then we've got our ideas about what they need to do
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.720]   in order to progress through life,
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.200]   often inherited from our parents
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.060]   and hopefully modified by the wonderful work
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.920]   that you're doing and writing about and in your program
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.060]   that we're talking about here.
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:23.520]   But how much space should we allow
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.500]   for kids to be unimpinged?
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.200]   Like you don't want to eat what we're eating for dinner,
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.400]   like, okay, I'm not going to cook you an entire new dinner,
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.220]   but then I guess like you might go to bed hungry.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.540]   Sounds harsh, right?
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.580]   But the other version is, okay,
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.180]   what would you like for dinner?
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.100]   Well, I prefer, let's say they pick a healthy option.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.900]   They prefer pasta, not chicken.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:50.680]   Okay, we won't do the ice cream chicken thing.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.540]   Do we do it?
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.720]   Right, like how much impingement?
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.780]   I don't want to watch a movie with the family.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.320]   I want to play in my room.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.120]   You know, at some level, I've heard it both ways
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.580]   that impingement is needed for safety and life progression,
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.600]   but there's times when it's more subtle than that.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.320]   It's not about safety and life progression.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.300]   It's not about going to school
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.920]   or not going to school, homework or no homework.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.760]   It's about like, do you want to come with us to the park?
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.660]   You want to play at home in your room?
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.300]   How often should we impinge?
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.420]   How do we know?
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:26.780]   This is kind of the tricky areas of parenting
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.300]   that I think, because it doesn't fall into the extremes.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.180]   - Yeah, I love this question.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.300]   That's a word I don't often hear actually.
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.500]   Impingement, like, can you act like what?
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.000]   Like definition-wise?
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.740]   - Like impinging on the child's inherent natural desires
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.800]   or aversion to things.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.640]   - Got it, okay.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.480]   - Like you say, we're going over so-and-so's house
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.520]   and they say, you know, I don't like their kids.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.340]   You go, listen, you got to learn to play with other kids
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.180]   and go, no, I don't like their kids.
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.860]   And you say, did something happen?
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.900]   And so we're not talking about a dangerous situation.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.560]   We're like, no, I don't like them.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.400]   I just really want to just stay home.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.240]   - Yeah, this is a great.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.200]   - So are we going to impinge on there?
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.660]   I mean, because we're teaching them,
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.500]   but either way, we're teaching them something.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.300]   You got to do stuff you don't want to do,
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.660]   even if you don't like it.
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.460]   And we're here again, we're ruling out the possibility
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.700]   that there's something unsafe about the environment,
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.180]   psychologically or physically unsafe.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.980]   Or, but at the same time, we're teaching them,
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.540]   hey, I see you, I hear you,
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.940]   but you know, your desires might not be right.
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.420]   There's actually a kind of like a tacit message
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.120]   of the way you feel might not be the best gauge
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:33.960]   of what's best for you,
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.280]   which sends a complicated message to a kid.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.020]   - Totally, so this is again, where I think at Good Inside,
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.920]   like family jobs are so useful.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.580]   Family jobs to me, when I used to meet with parents
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.060]   and like they describe a situation,
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.440]   I feel like 90% of the time that's where I'd start,
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.540]   because then that flows from there.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:49.360]   It's like a framework.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.980]   So what is my job?
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.160]   I'm the one who sets boundaries.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.680]   Like I am the one who makes key family decisions.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.960]   Obviously, as our kids get older,
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.580]   they should be making some decisions too.
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.040]   No one likes to feel controlled, but key decisions.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.640]   And my job is to validate my kids' experience.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.580]   This is actually complicated because again,
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.460]   over and over, we think that validating my kids' experience
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.380]   means they're gonna dictate a decision.
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.660]   My boundaries don't dictate my kids' feelings,
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:18.120]   and my kids' feelings should not dictate my boundaries.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.280]   They're just two equal things.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.260]   So this is a great example.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.260]   My kids are like, you know,
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.460]   I don't like playing with those kids,
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.180]   and can I just stay home with,
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.660]   let's just say grandma was home.
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:26.740]   Can I just stay home?
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.660]   And I'm like, I just think it's important to go as a family,
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:29.980]   but my kid doesn't wanna go.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:30.900]   There's nothing dangerous.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.020]   Okay, to me, this is that exact way
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.700]   of putting family jobs into action, sweetie.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.840]   And to me, this phrase,
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.740]   I wish every parent could say this to their kid.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:40.860]   I believe you.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.920]   If you wanna make a kid feel real and confident for life,
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.780]   confidence comes from the experience of being believed,
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.380]   'cause that's how you, for me, confidence is self-trust.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.540]   It's not feeling good about yourself.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.260]   It's self-trust.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.100]   I really do know the way I feel.
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.420]   So let's say I say to my son in that situation,
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.740]   it's, I believe you, I believe you.
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:03.300]   Look, I know you want to play football all day,
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.220]   and the kid around your age hates football.
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.480]   Like that would probably be lowest on your list
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.580]   of types of kids you'd wanna hang out with
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:11.420]   for the afternoon.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.000]   I totally believe you.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.220]   And in this family, we know that sometimes we have
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.340]   to do things we don't love to do.
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.180]   We do that for a family experience.
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.360]   I say this to my kid all the time.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.020]   You know, also just to end up being a good adult,
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.160]   you just have to end up practicing as a kid,
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.220]   doing things you don't wanna do, things that are boring,
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:33.420]   things that aren't your preference.
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.700]   So, you know, you notch in your belt for that.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.660]   So you don't have to thank me.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.260]   And also, I know you have it in you
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.700]   to do your best to be polite and engaged.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.620]   Like, I just, I know you're a good kid,
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.800]   and this isn't what you want,
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.380]   and I know we're gonna get through it.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.100]   Now, if it's really hard, maybe, Yong, hey,
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.140]   let's create a sign.
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:51.740]   Like, can you look at me and go,
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.980]   when you feel like you're kind of at this,
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.820]   and then me and you, we're gonna go to the bathroom,
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.460]   I'm gonna give you a hug, and, right,
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.380]   I'm gonna say, I know this isn't what you want,
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.420]   and when we get home, we can watch that football game,
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.280]   whatever it was, right?
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.140]   Because what we often do is we leave ourselves
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.580]   with two choices with kids.
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.820]   We either say, fine, stay home.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.860]   Their feelings actually just dictated the decision.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.380]   That's not helpful for them.
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.340]   I don't want my kid to learn in life.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.800]   When I don't wanna do something,
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.060]   people twist and turn to make that thing not happen.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.620]   That's disturbing for adulthood expectations.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.700]   But then we do the other thing,
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.560]   which is you are so selfish.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.340]   Just because you don't have a friend your age
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.920]   doesn't mean that you can't come with us.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.860]   So we either let their feelings dictate,
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.600]   or we think our boundaries kind of give us the right
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.700]   to be mad at our kid, right?
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:43.100]   To do both is so important.
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.420]   And so that's where I think, to me,
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.060]   when I hear impingement,
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.500]   I actually think that is the exact space
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.400]   where you have the most bang for your buck as a parent.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.740]   Like, it's not enjoyable.
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.240]   And again, if I have my beautiful intervention with my son,
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.420]   do not think my kid will look at me and say,
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.620]   I love how you explained that.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.640]   That was so beautiful.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.280]   No, he's gonna roll his eyes.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.520]   My job is not to take the bait, 'cause I'm an adult,
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.200]   and to also hold hope.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.620]   I think that's really important, this concept of,
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.660]   I'm validating my kids' feelings where they are today,
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.600]   but I need to be the one to hold hope
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.140]   that they can cope with it.
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.120]   If I can't name to my kid,
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.780]   I know you're gonna get through it.
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:19.900]   They're not gonna be able to see
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.440]   that kind of next, more mature version of themselves.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.780]   And I actually think it's the same as your best boss.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.740]   You know, it was like,
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.580]   I know you don't wanna go on this trip.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.820]   Whatever it is, I know this presentation topic
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.420]   isn't the one you would have chosen,
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.980]   and there were 10 things, and this was literally number 10.
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.860]   I totally get that, and it stinks,
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.860]   and I'm not taking anything away from that.
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:42.900]   And this is the thing I need you to do.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.640]   And I know something about you.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.340]   When you put your mind to something,
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.760]   you always do a great job,
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.740]   and it's probably not gonna be enjoyable,
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.800]   but I do know you're gonna do a great job on this.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.400]   That's the boss you want.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.240]   - Amazing.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.960]   Are you adopting children, by the way?
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.060]   'Cause I actually finished college.
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:04.200]   - You, I consider, Andrew, you, adult children.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:09.440]   - What I'm hearing is don't dictate their behavior,
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.280]   and I'm gonna underline in bold, dictate.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.640]   Don't dictate their behavior.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.360]   You're going to do this because I said so.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.360]   That's dictatorship.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.720]   But at the same time,
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:23.000]   don't quash the emotion behind the resistance.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.240]   Kind of acknowledge it, make them feel real.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.280]   I believe you.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.500]   I love this phrase.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.340]   Amazing.
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.420]   And I love your definition of confidence.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.400]   If people didn't hear that,
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.780]   we're definitely gonna repeat it again,
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.900]   and we're gonna etch it into your neural circuitry
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.420]   'cause I love that.
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:44.420]   It's a self trust, and this notion of giving hope,
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:49.900]   you're giving them an incentive that's based on a reward
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.660]   that's actually good for them
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:54.400]   that they can translate to other situations as well.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.620]   - Wow.
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:59.060]   Can I double click on reward?
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.160]   Because you know what made me think,
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.140]   I didn't think until you said that,
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.060]   like I think in a situation where you'd be tempted to say,
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:06.380]   and if you go and you're polite,
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:09.500]   I'll give you 20 extra minutes of Roblox, right?
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.100]   That's like...
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.780]   And first of all, let me just say something.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:15.860]   Like whatever I say to you, like for listeners,
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.380]   it's not like I do this stuff all the time
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:18.220]   with my actual kids.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.460]   I'm the first one sometimes to be like,
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:20.900]   here's your thing I have to dangle.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.780]   - We'll put out a little section in the comment section
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.860]   on YouTube where your kids can,
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.020]   no, I'm just kidding. - Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:25.860]   - Your kids are forbidden.
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.340]   No, ooh, wait, that's, wait, that's dictating.
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.660]   We understand why you,
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:31.860]   I believe that you would want to comment,
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.560]   but we're gonna trust,
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.980]   we're gonna let you know why it's good for you if you don't.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.860]   Anyway, I'll practice this on someone else's kids.
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.420]   - But the reward, like the,
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:43.900]   when your kid ends up seeing themself
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.780]   capable of doing something
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.900]   they didn't previously think they could do,
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.020]   you know better than me,
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:53.180]   but I feel like that is like one of the best rewards,
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.780]   even if it's getting through a social situation.
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.460]   Or I think about this a lot with, you know,
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.640]   my little kid is, I don't know,
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.660]   like struggling with a puzzle or something,
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:03.300]   and I could just do it for them.
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.500]   Or if I help them kind of regulate,
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.460]   oh, this is a hard puzzle,
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:08.520]   and you can take a break,
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.220]   I just know you're gonna figure it out.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.060]   Today, I just know it.
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:16.440]   And then because of that, they get there.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.940]   That feels in your body,
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.820]   like that is the best kind of reward.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:23.740]   And it's the type of reward that works for kids in adulthood.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:24.780]   When they're in a job,
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.420]   we want them to be motivated
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.100]   by the feeling they're gonna have of pride.
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.300]   Not be saying, hey, I finished my thing early.
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.760]   Do I get a bonus to their boss?
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.140]   Like that's not gonna play out as well.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:35.980]   - I love it.
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:39.260]   I'm just pausing and shaking my head
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.160]   only 'cause I love it so much.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.040]   And I just wanna make sure
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.900]   that I don't quickly move to the next question
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.620]   without drilling down even deeper
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.020]   into some of these concepts.
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:53.100]   I believe you as the feedback or response
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.920]   that can instill real confidence over time.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.460]   Not to get too nuanced here,
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.900]   but how is it different?
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:05.340]   Because I sense it is different than I hear you.
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:09.100]   I hear you, but you're gonna do this anyway.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.740]   Or I hear you, but listen in this family,
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:16.340]   I believe you, the word believe is powerful.
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.460]   And I believe there's real power in specific words
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.620]   as is like for instance, sturdiness,
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.860]   again, that's such a powerful and underused word.
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:24.800]   I believe you.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.460]   You're a psychologist.
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:30.180]   What do you think we're hearing
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.960]   when somebody says I believe you?
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.220]   That's different than I hear you.
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:35.180]   - I haven't listed these out,
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:38.180]   but I think we all have these like core needs as humans.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.540]   And I think being believed is one of them
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:45.540]   because it's someone else kind of saying you're real.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:49.640]   I might not feel what you're feeling,
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.620]   but that thing that feels strong to you
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:57.140]   that nobody can see or measure is real.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:02.180]   And when I think about the most confident people,
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:05.260]   like I think about this girl who I went to Duke with
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.420]   and she was just brilliant, like so smart.
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.980]   We were in this seminar.
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:10.700]   It was one of these small classes where this professor
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.420]   was like talking about stuff.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.420]   And like I, for once, I was like,
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:14.860]   I have no idea what this person's talking about.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.240]   But like, I was like, no one else was stopping.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.120]   And this girl raised her hand and she said,
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.500]   I'm sorry if everyone else is annoying.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.620]   Like I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.140]   Like, is there any, 'cause I usually do.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.820]   And like, is there any way you could say that
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.580]   in a different way?
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:32.580]   That is like, to me, the utmost version of confidence,
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:36.220]   that she believed her own experience of confusion
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.260]   was real confusion.
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.420]   She didn't think it was a sign.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:40.300]   She was stupid.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.700]   She believed it.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:42.980]   She believed herself.
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:45.540]   That is so confident.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.540]   And I think when someone says, I hear you,
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.120]   it's like a version of listening.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.140]   There's many worse phrases.
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.900]   No damage is done.
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:57.300]   When we follow anything but but, we tend to invalidate.
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.220]   So that's not good anyway.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.140]   I believe you, but is also not gonna.
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.620]   But there's a million examples of this to me
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:04.060]   that build confidence.
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:07.620]   And I actually think there's so many situations with kids
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.460]   where they say situations and we worry,
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.900]   oh, they have low confidence.
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:14.180]   And then we intervene to quote, make them feel better,
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.420]   which actually is the thing that lowers their confidence.
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.060]   'Cause it's like, we say to them, I don't believe you.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.140]   You're not really feeling the way you feel.
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.580]   Where I believe you is the exact opposite.
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:26.540]   So I like to give examples just 'cause it makes it concrete.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.300]   Like my kid will come home and say,
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:36.380]   I don't know, I was picked last for dodge ball today.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.660]   I was picked last in something.
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.820]   And they're clearly very, very sad, right?
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:43.780]   And we wanna say to them, like, it's no big deal.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.580]   Or everyone's picked last sometimes.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.500]   Or remember yesterday you told me
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.180]   you were picked first for basketball.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:53.060]   And we think like, I need to build up my kid's confidence.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:56.700]   Those are confidence, I won't say destroying us,
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.700]   reducing interventions.
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.740]   'Cause a kid is kind of coming to a parent basically saying,
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:05.020]   I'm very, very upset that I was picked last.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.980]   And we're saying to a kid, no, you weren't.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.620]   And they're like, but I am.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:13.540]   And what they learn is, and this is really terrifying to me,
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:18.540]   is other people are better feelers of my feelings than I am.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.900]   And it has like a million really scary interpersonal,
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:28.900]   I think, relationship kind of consequences later down in life.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.180]   But when a kid says, I was picked last
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.340]   and nobody even wants me
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.900]   and they all think I'm the worst athlete,
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:37.900]   whatever kids say, to sit and say some version of like,
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.780]   I'm so glad we're talking about this.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.700]   And I can tell that was a really hard gym class.
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:46.060]   And sweetie, like, I believe you.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.540]   You will watch your kid.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:51.580]   It is crazy to me what parents tell me happen
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.980]   when they say those words to their kids.
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:56.340]   They're like, it also just like literally diffused everything
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.740]   and they were like ready to move on.
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:00.420]   Like they are just trying to tell you probably
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.860]   like I was feeling something, it was a lot,
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.620]   it was confusing, right?
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:06.460]   Our feelings are always hardest when we're alone in them.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:07.980]   So I was alone in it and I bring it to you.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:09.860]   When someone says, I believe you,
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:13.180]   not only are they giving you that core need,
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:14.260]   they're also just like,
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:16.280]   they're like sitting down with you in it.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.040]   And that makes everything better.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.340]   And then meanwhile, what a kid feels like when we say,
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:23.200]   I believe you to a hard experience or hard feelings,
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.820]   they're like the feelings that overwhelm me
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.660]   don't overwhelm my parents.
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:28.560]   They can tolerate it.
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.860]   They're not scared of me kind of being a loser
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.420]   in gym class one day.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:36.900]   And if my parent likes me, when I have that feeling,
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:39.920]   like I can start to like myself when I have that feeling.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.740]   - It's so great because it sounds like
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:45.260]   it accomplishes both things.
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:48.780]   It makes kids feel real and safe.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:49.620]   - Yes.
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.900]   - Real and safe.
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:56.660]   And I can't help but ask, say,
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.820]   because how we started off today
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.800]   was that this isn't just about parent-child relationships,
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:05.140]   but in friendships, in romantic relationships,
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:09.040]   in coworker relationships, that the words, I believe you,
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:12.540]   I have to presume based on everything I'm hearing now
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.240]   and feeling inside about it,
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.420]   that it's equally effective.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:18.260]   - Huge.
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:20.180]   Years ago, I was on a podcast early on,
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.720]   and to me, there are these three lines
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.480]   that kind of all go together when kids are,
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.820]   anyone's upset, and it's kind of like you start,
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:27.580]   and to me, it's like a beautiful invitation
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.760]   to have that conversation just to say to someone,
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.240]   I'm so glad you're talking to me about this, right?
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.340]   And then kind of, I believe you, tell me more.
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.460]   And my husband, when he heard it, was like,
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.800]   you could say those words to me sometimes.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.220]   I would like that because,
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.800]   and I think about the workplace too.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.840]   You have someone come in, they're upset about,
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.260]   I don't know, I got staffed on this,
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.760]   or I'm not getting a promotion,
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.300]   and I thought I was, just diffuse it with just,
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.040]   I'm so glad you're talking to me about this.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.320]   Yeah, I've been working nonstop for,
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:57.480]   and just, if you say to them, I'm like, I believe you.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.320]   'Cause we usually don't say to someone, I don't believe you.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.920]   But what we'll say is we defend ourselves in that moment,
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.320]   and the way the other person receives it
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:10.680]   is as if we're saying, I don't believe the intensity
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.640]   of the experience you're having.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.800]   And when you do lead with I believe you,
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.880]   same thing in a partnership.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.320]   Every time I ask you to do something,
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.760]   you get really hot and bothered.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.960]   It doesn't even mean you agree.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.360]   You're kind of just believing, I believe you.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.680]   Tell me more.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.460]   I believe you that that really upset you.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.520]   And I'm obviously, I have a whole other story in my head,
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:35.160]   but I hear what you're saying,
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.960]   and I know there's something there,
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:40.360]   and I believe it enough to be open to hearing more about it.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.920]   I don't know, that's like what's best.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.880]   That's what we all want in our partnerships.
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:45.800]   - I mean, I'm wide-eyed.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.720]   I mean, what a beautiful acknowledgement
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.800]   that, as you pointed out,
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.520]   is not agreeing to accept someone else's reality
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.560]   to the extent that you're going to dismantle
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:59.920]   the order of the world or whatever it is.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.360]   But it's such an opening as opposed to a closing.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:05.280]   And as you said, it's non-defended,
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.360]   but it's also boundaried.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:10.480]   I mean, there's just so many things about it
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:15.480]   that feel good, seem good, and clearly are good.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:20.380]   I don't want to go down the tragic rabbit hole of trauma,
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:23.240]   but previous guests on this podcast,
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.220]   we should probably define trauma
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.620]   just because it gets thrown around a lot.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.440]   Trauma, an event or set of circumstances
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.520]   that fundamentally changed the way
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.980]   that the brain and nervous system works
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:38.080]   so that there's a maladaptive response going forward.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.600]   It's not every bad thing that happens,
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.320]   but there are micro-traumas,
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:44.160]   sometimes called small t, more macro-traumas.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.160]   Big T, again, could be multi-event or single event.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:51.240]   But years ago, a different psychologist, psychiatrist,
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.700]   who's an adolescent psychiatrist at Stanford,
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.520]   said something in a seminar that just really struck me,
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.120]   which was that at its core,
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:04.120]   trauma is really about confusion over who's responsible.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.560]   And here, we're not just talking about
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:09.840]   the more salient examples of sexual assault,
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:14.840]   those two, of course, but if we get screamed at,
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:19.480]   or we observe something like third-person trauma,
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:23.760]   the logical stance is, well, okay, that was them, not me.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.080]   But when this happens, especially when we're young,
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:29.840]   the nervous system, the brain somehow interprets this
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.800]   as I was there, I had a role in it just by being there,
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.480]   so what was my role?
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.920]   And then somehow the emotional response
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.200]   becomes one of responsibility,
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.240]   even if we know like they're clearly
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.800]   the one that initiated this.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:45.200]   And so the reason I'm bringing this up in this context
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:48.680]   is that it's almost like that lack of belief in self
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:52.280]   somehow gets rooted in, and then it all feels confusing,
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.280]   and then we don't feel safe,
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.600]   because it's a confusion about responsibility.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.760]   Again, going back to these words-
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.480]   - Can we go down that rabbit hole for a second?
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.200]   - Please, please, that's why I raised it.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.720]   - I think that- - I want your thoughts,
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:04.600]   not mine. - I always think trauma
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.800]   is actually not events.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.200]   It's the way an event gets processed.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.360]   And I love Gabor Matei's definition of trauma,
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.400]   it's not what happens to you,
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.760]   it's what happens inside of you, right?
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.680]   So to me, there's an inherent relationality there,
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:20.720]   where events that get, not any event,
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:22.120]   events with high emotionality,
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:27.120]   let's say that get processed in aloneness become traumatic.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:30.000]   And I think that's where it gets linked to responsibility.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.680]   So this is actually what my TED Talk was about
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.200]   and why repair is so important.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.760]   Who said this?
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.080]   Ronald Fairburn, years ago,
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.180]   that for kids, it is better to be a sinner
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:43.160]   in a world ruled by God,
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.880]   than to live in a world ruled by the devil.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:48.000]   I think it explains almost everything
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.840]   about child development right there.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.400]   Going back to goodness also.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:54.520]   Your parent just screamed at you.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.560]   And by the way, your parent, I scream at my kids.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.240]   Everyone's gonna scream at their kids, it's gonna happen.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.360]   Okay, that's just the event.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.400]   The event's not gonna have the impact.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.660]   What is happening for a kid?
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:04.440]   Well, we know kids are oriented by attachment.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:06.800]   They literally need us to survive.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.120]   They could not survive on their own.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.420]   And so what do you do when the person you're dependent on
[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:17.220]   for safety becomes the source of danger and threat?
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.680]   That's very confusing for a child in that moment.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.200]   So they're super hyper aroused.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.400]   They're in this state of terror.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.720]   And then usually after in my house,
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:26.620]   too, I just yell at my kid.
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.480]   They're kind of alone in their room.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.320]   I'm alone in the kitchen or wherever.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.240]   Meanwhile, spinning, 'cause I'm like, I'm such a bad parent.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:33.780]   Like I'm probably, you know, but meanwhile,
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:36.180]   because I'm so lost in my own guilt,
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:38.080]   I might not be going to my kid.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:41.520]   And so what happens for my kid if I don't repair
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.840]   after I scream at them or one of these events, right?
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:48.720]   Well, a kid cannot say to themselves,
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.400]   my parent just had a bad day.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:53.020]   Then the badness is in my parent.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:55.160]   My leader, I'm young now, right?
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.240]   Like I don't understand nuance.
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.240]   My leader can't be bad.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.920]   So I must take on the badness, at least then I have control.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.200]   So kids, after they're kind of yelled at,
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.400]   in the absence of repair,
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.200]   they really only have two options
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.020]   for how to regulate and feel safe again.
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.360]   They can self blame, it's all my fault,
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.320]   which is why I feel like most adults,
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.600]   when they have a hard time,
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.160]   they tell themselves like, it's my fault.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:18.980]   I'm not good enough.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:22.320]   It's like the legacy of that story from childhood.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.360]   Or they use self doubt.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.240]   Maybe that didn't happen.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.440]   Maybe I overreacted.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.740]   Maybe I can't trust myself.
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:31.240]   Again, it leads to adults who basically say like,
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.080]   did I overreact?
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.780]   Or let me call five friends.
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.560]   Let me see if they think what my boyfriend did
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:39.040]   was a big deal 'cause they can't trust themselves.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.200]   And so trauma, what I want every parent to know
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.640]   is they'll say, I left my kid alone
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.040]   and I didn't pick them up at the soccer field.
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.680]   Is that gonna traumatize them?
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.240]   And I'll say, well, that's just the event.
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:50.760]   Like, did you say to them, hey, that probably felt scary.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.360]   What was that like?
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.280]   Oh, you're right.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.800]   Like you were alone.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:58.000]   Now all of a sudden next to the event that was scary
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.360]   is my story and my connection.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.280]   It got processed in a safe connection.
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:04.560]   It didn't get processed in aloneness.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:07.440]   And that's a massive, massive difference.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.680]   - The scenario you are describing,
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.440]   the parent who yelled goes to the child,
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:15.320]   having been that child
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.240]   and perhaps also having been that parent.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:21.660]   How do we deal with the fact that sometimes,
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:25.560]   we don't want to be around the person that yelled at us.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.800]   It hurts to receive the care.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.120]   There's like a textured landscape
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.000]   as opposed to a smooth landscape there.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.680]   Like, okay, now you're ready for everything to be peaceful.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.000]   I'm still with my feelings.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.840]   I guess that's where the, I believe you comes in.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.840]   And that's where the sorting it through process begins.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:46.680]   Is that right?
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.200]   - I think it's like what version of a parent comes back.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:52.980]   To me, the first thing we have to do in a repair process
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:57.080]   is actually repair with ourselves as a parent, really.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.760]   Because if you haven't repaired with yourself,
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:01.680]   which to me is kind of separating your identity again
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.520]   from your behavior, like, okay, Becky,
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.040]   I'll use myself as an example.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:08.240]   I'm a good parent who just screamed at her son.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.760]   Like, I did not mess up forever.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.280]   And you see when you try to repair with yourself,
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.560]   those two things get collapsed.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:13.600]   I'm like, I messed him up forever.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:14.440]   I'm a monster.
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:16.440]   Wait, like, I'm a good parent
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:18.820]   who did something I'm not proud of.
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:19.880]   You can't repair with someone
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.120]   until you've repaired with yourself.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.120]   They feel it from you.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.640]   They actually, it usually is like,
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.980]   then you're asking for them.
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.640]   I'll be like, it's okay, right?
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.840]   Like, you forgive me, right?
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:29.880]   That's not a repair.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.720]   That's like using your child to try to do something
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:34.840]   we just have to do on our own or with other adults.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.760]   But if I've repaired with myself,
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.160]   I'm gonna show up in a different way.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.300]   Might I have a feisty kid?
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:40.140]   I might.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.160]   It's like, I don't care.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.000]   It's not better.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:42.920]   That's okay.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:45.440]   I'm not repairing to get something from my child.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.960]   I'm repairing to give an experience to them.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.840]   So we can also get creative.
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.600]   You know, your kid is older, you text them,
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.140]   you slip a door under the note.
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:55.580]   You say, okay, I just have to say this one thing.
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:57.660]   To me, this line really matters to like snatch
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.380]   that self-blame out of a kid's body.
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:01.220]   It's just like, I'm sorry I yelled.
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:03.260]   It's never your fault when I yell.
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:05.360]   And it's not.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:07.820]   And people who argue, like our ability
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:11.940]   to regulate our emotions predated our child's existence.
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:14.760]   Like that, you know, like they had something,
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:18.660]   they did something and we felt frustrated,
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:22.220]   but that's very different than yelling, right?
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:25.540]   And saying that to your kid is so important.
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:27.900]   Meanwhile, the next day you might say, by the way,
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:30.260]   let's really figure out how to get out the door
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:31.100]   in a smoother way.
[00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.660]   You know, you could work on whatever they need to work on.
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:35.600]   But the reason I think most kids end up
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:38.820]   rejecting parents' apologies is it's not really a repair.
[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:42.180]   We're asking our kid for permission to be okay again.
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:44.780]   Or our repair sounds like, hey, I'm sorry I yelled,
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:47.460]   but you know, like if you just got ready in time,
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:48.420]   that wouldn't have happened.
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.860]   Or we say, I'm sorry you felt that way.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:52.140]   I'm sorry you felt that way.
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:54.380]   Those are not, like none of those are actually repairs.
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.580]   And if that's what a kid's been used to,
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:59.140]   they're gonna keep a parent more at bay.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.880]   - So is it safe to say that we can always come back
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:06.880]   to making the kid feel real and safe?
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.240]   I believe you is a great place to start.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.340]   And the reason I keep coming back to these simple things
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:14.240]   is that, simple but very, very potent, by the way,
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.900]   is that in the real world landscape
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.300]   of parenting family and life,
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.900]   things are happening really fast and it's very dynamic
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.400]   and it's multifaceted.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.180]   I mean, we haven't even talked yet about how,
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:29.940]   when there's two parents, like the one that didn't yell,
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:32.560]   when there's multiple siblings,
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.860]   when I mean, there's human dynamics on one,
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:38.080]   in an other landscape is hard enough.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.180]   And then when you start introducing
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:42.380]   the real world landscape, things happen fast.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:45.320]   So having something that people can reach to really quickly,
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.820]   what I call in the landscape of stress modulation,
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:49.660]   which is something that I'm more familiar with
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:52.180]   from my lab's work is, you know, real time tools.
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:53.500]   - Yep. - Real time tools.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.300]   We're all at our best after meditation,
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.820]   vacation, massage, and a good night's sleep.
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.020]   But what about real time tools
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.340]   when everything's hectic?
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:07.940]   So what does a really good apology look like
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:11.460]   in the real world? - Yeah.
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:12.940]   - Because a really good apology
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:17.940]   in the ideal world of Instagram is yeah, I believe you.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.700]   I'm so sorry with no buts, no this and that.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:28.320]   But a real apology sometimes is as you're boarding a plane
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.740]   or when there's a bunch of other things that are going on
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.640]   and you haven't even dealt with those yet,
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.220]   or when you're on your way to an event or you, yeah, okay.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:36.820]   So you get it.
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:40.460]   What does a really good internal landscape
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.540]   for apology look like?
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.060]   Like, how can we touch into where we need to be?
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.780]   And then what are the words that,
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.660]   even if we have to try again later
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.700]   and again and again later with that person,
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.440]   in this case, kid, but person more generally,
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.300]   what's the go-to solid apology?
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.120]   - So yeah, I think you're never gonna go wrong
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.560]   saying I believe you to your kid.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.880]   Like obviously not if you say it randomly,
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.380]   but if they're really upset, you yelled at me,
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.220]   I believe you.
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.900]   Like, if that's all you can remember, you're crushing it.
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:11.460]   I think a realistic repair,
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.400]   you have to do something for yourself.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.280]   And like, to me, it can be a very simple mantra.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.560]   Like to me, I'm a good parent who is having a hard time
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.580]   is the one I use, honestly, over and over.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.480]   Just, and after I yell at my kid,
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.340]   before I'll like go to the bathroom sometimes
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.700]   and I'll say that to myself, Becky,
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.380]   like I'm a good parent having a hard time.
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.220]   And I'll kind of say it as many times as I need
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.660]   until I really do feel something
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:35.100]   like shift a little in my body.
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.900]   It just, 'cause again, I think that phrase separates
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:41.800]   what I did from who I am, right?
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.860]   And then to me, a realistic apology,
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:44.780]   it could be super simple.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:45.620]   If you remember nothing else,
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:49.960]   it could just be like, I'm sorry, I yelled, that's great.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.360]   If you wanna, if you're like, I'm feeling it, Becky,
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:55.980]   give me that next step, you know, I'm sorry, I yelled.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.840]   Just like you, I'm working on managing my emotions
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.680]   and you know, next time, even when I'm frustrated,
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.860]   I'm gonna try to stay calm.
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.080]   Something about the next time, you know,
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.840]   if you wanna throw in that it's not your fault.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.800]   Kids, it seems an odd thing because parents are like,
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.740]   why do kids assume it's their fault?
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:19.540]   It is their default position.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.920]   And so it's never a bad thing to throw in,
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.880]   but honestly, just simply, hey, I'm sorry, I yelled.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.160]   That actually gives them that realness
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.900]   because without saying anything more,
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:34.100]   you're saying that thing you think happened did happen.
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:36.160]   So that's powerful.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.260]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:39.680]   and thank our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.140]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.740]   that analyzes data from your blood
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:46.440]   and DNA to help you better understand your body
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.200]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.960]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.800]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.040]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.880]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.960]   A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there,
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.360]   however, is that you get information back
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:05.240]   about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth,
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.280]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.480]   With Inside Tracker, they make it very easy
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.420]   because they have a personalized platform
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.960]   that allows you to see the levels of all those things,
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.480]   metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera,
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:19.360]   but it gives you specific directives that you can follow
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.680]   that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification,
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.320]   supplements, et cetera, that can help you bring those numbers
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.580]   into the ranges that are optimal for you.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.000]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.280]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.900]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:37.580]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman.
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:42.580]   How do you suggest parents deal with retorts and rudeness?
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:46.040]   And again, let's extend this to all relationships.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.960]   So you get in your best mindset.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.040]   And by the way, I love this I am thing,
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:57.480]   two of the most important words in any language
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.080]   when translated to other languages.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.480]   I am blank, I am a good this, or I am whatever.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.040]   Role identity is key to the brain, we know this.
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:11.140]   You go in and you say, I'm really sorry.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:14.900]   I struggle to regulate my emotions.
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:19.700]   I believe that you're really upset.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:22.420]   And the kid says, I hate you.
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:25.300]   Now, earlier you said that good boundaries
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.980]   are about not expecting a change in behavior
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.860]   from someone else, they're about our own boundaries.
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:34.780]   So, or maybe the I hate you comes from,
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:37.200]   listen, we're not going to go to so-and-so's house
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.180]   for a play date today.
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:40.220]   - Great example, I hate you.
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:41.060]   - I hate you.
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:45.960]   So is there ever a case for no response?
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:50.740]   - I mean, to me, the most underutilized parenting strategy
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.460]   is doing nothing, literally.
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.940]   It's one of my most used strategies 'cause,
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.620]   and there's like really good reason for it,
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.880]   especially in this situation.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.440]   So I always, to me, like I always say,
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.200]   we have to understand before we intervene.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.100]   So I know every parent's like,
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:05.420]   what do you do in that situation?
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:09.260]   But it's like trying to fix someone's tennis swing
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.340]   before you like look at their tennis swing, right?
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.660]   Like there could be a lot of problems.
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.420]   So again, why is a kid saying, I hate you?
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.720]   And I would ask every parent to just keep this in mind.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.900]   It's a tool and you can't use it in real time.
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:22.760]   Eventually you can, but we have to say it
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.640]   at like the end of the night.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.420]   When my kid said, I hate you,
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:29.660]   what is my most generous interpretation
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:31.580]   of why he would say that to me?
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:34.540]   And if you're like any human, me included, by the way,
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:37.740]   like your least generous interpretation is immediate.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:38.980]   You're like, because he's a sociopath.
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:40.460]   Like that's what we say all the time.
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:42.460]   We're like, wow, or because he's like a horrible kid
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.260]   'cause he's spoiled, 'cause he's nasty.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:45.180]   It comes easily.
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.280]   So that's fine.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.860]   But what is my most generous interpretation?
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.740]   And when I don't know, I'll push myself to say,
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:54.980]   okay, well, like I was in a situation with my husband.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:57.280]   What would lead me to say that?
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.540]   What would lead you to say that to someone?
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:01.380]   - That I hate them?
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:02.820]   - Yeah, like they like say something to you like,
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:06.540]   hey, Andrew, we're not gonna be able to do this dinner.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.780]   - It would have to be some sort of deep betrayal of trust.
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:13.460]   And I have to acknowledge that if I said that to somebody
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.360]   that I really care about or love,
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.620]   as I'm saying, I hate you,
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.060]   what I'm really saying is I love you so much.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:22.260]   And that hurts unbelievably,
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:24.540]   such an unbelievable intensity
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.380]   that what's coming out of my mouth is I hate you
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.660]   because if you didn't love them.
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:29.500]   - That's right.
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:30.500]   - It would have no effect.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.740]   It would be a meh.
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:36.280]   It would be a meh, but instead it's a, oh, it hurts.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:40.320]   So we, somehow there's a neural circuit in there that goes,
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:44.060]   you know, I whatever insert explicit hate you.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:44.900]   - That's right.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.840]   - But what you're really saying is I love you so much.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.680]   - Yeah.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.820]   - And as a consequence, that thing you did or said
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:52.340]   hurts so much.
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.420]   - That's right.
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:57.380]   And so I think that's like exactly what's going on for a kid
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:01.100]   or like to me, my most generous interpretation
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:03.100]   in a simple way is my kid,
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:05.340]   when I said we couldn't go to this friend's house
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:06.740]   that he thought we were going to,
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:09.220]   his friend he was gonna sleep over,
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:10.900]   he had like so built it up in his mind.
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.000]   He'd like, probably like kids do,
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   like they have this whole image,
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.240]   oh, and then we're gonna do this and this.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.260]   And like the let down was so intense.
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:21.140]   And again, I go back to kids have all the feelings we have
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.700]   and they're born with none of the skills.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.340]   So it takes a lot of,
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.060]   it takes like a pretty well-developed skill
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.560]   to be really disappointed by the way.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.560]   And surprised, right?
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.880]   In the moment and like manage it in like a mature way.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.360]   I'm sure we both know adults
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.400]   who aren't really capable of doing that, right?
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.120]   So the fact that my seven year old is doing that.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.320]   So if I think about it that way,
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.100]   we latch onto our kids' words as if they're the truth.
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.100]   They're not the truth.
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.400]   It's not to say they don't matter,
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.800]   but they're not the truth.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.120]   The truth is whatever world is under the words.
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.060]   Like I'm disappointed and I don't know how to manage that.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.360]   So if I think about the outcome,
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.840]   like where do I wanna be?
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.020]   What I would love in that situation.
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.320]   'Cause the truth is when I say to my kid,
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.360]   "Sorry, we can't go to Bobby's house."
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.200]   I wouldn't even want,
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.920]   it's not normal for my kid to be like,
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.640]   "Oh, no problem."
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.240]   Because like I'm just picturing my 25 year old
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.800]   like trying to get a job and being like,
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.200]   "Mom, oh, I didn't get it."
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.480]   And then he's like, "No problem."
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.680]   I'm like, "That's kind of weird.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.240]   Like really like that's weird.
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.540]   Like I'd want you to be disappointed."
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.680]   And so what I want my kid to be able to do
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.520]   is to be like, I don't know what's the best to get.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.160]   It's like, "Oh man, I was really looking forward to that."
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.780]   That's like ultimate maturity.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:32.420]   So how do I get from I hate you to,
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:36.780]   "Oh man, I was really like looking forward to that."
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:38.540]   The whole, all the things we wanna do
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:39.680]   just like don't even make sense.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.900]   Like sending my kid to their room saying like,
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:43.000]   "You're such a nasty kid.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.440]   I've never seen any of your friends
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.560]   say that to their parents."
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.120]   And I'm good at acting these things out
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.080]   'cause of course I say these things too.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.520]   But all I'm doing is basically telling my kid
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.960]   the version of themselves I don't want them to be.
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.400]   So now I'm further away from that outcome.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.660]   Just not effective.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:01.020]   My kid obviously literally needs to learn
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:02.940]   some of those skills and practice them.
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:05.000]   We don't think about simulations with kids nearly enough.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.460]   We know that in sports.
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.800]   People practice all the time.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.520]   We don't do that with emotion regulation.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.680]   So what do I do in the moment?
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.660]   I think the best question here is,
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:14.260]   what do I do outside the moment
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:15.760]   to help my kid build the skills
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.600]   so they actually have more of a skill
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.160]   the next time that moment comes?
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.320]   Still, I'm a pragmatist.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.140]   What do I do in the moment?
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:21.980]   I hate you.
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:23.700]   I probably would do nothing first.
[01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:27.200]   When someone is rude to you and they say something nasty,
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:29.600]   I don't know, I just like, this is my son, this is me.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.520]   My son just hurled, "I hate you."
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.120]   It's like sitting between us.
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:36.560]   When we say back to them, like, you know,
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.060]   "I hate you," or like, "Go to your room,"
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.080]   we take all the energy from what they said
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.240]   and we just like throw it.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.980]   And then like we have this ping pong match.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.000]   When you do nothing, I always picture
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.600]   if this is like the "I hate you," it just sits between us.
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:54.420]   My kid has a much higher chance of kind of re-owning
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:58.100]   what they just said because I'm just kind of sturdy
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.900]   in that moment because I didn't just take it from them
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.020]   and say something to them,
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:03.460]   which just gives them the opportunity
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:06.340]   to like take what I said and have no responsibility
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.660]   for the first thing they said.
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:08.800]   It's always true in adults.
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.660]   When someone says to you like something nasty,
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.560]   if you actually just stay there,
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.060]   they're kind of like, "Oh, shoot.
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:15.380]   "Like I shouldn't have said that."
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.060]   Because like it's right there.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.180]   So I'd probably say nothing.
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.520]   Now a couple, I don't know if I'd really do that,
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.720]   but I'd want to do that, let me be clear.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.220]   Something else you can say in that moment,
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.320]   which takes a lot of presence,
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.360]   so it's not gonna happen right away,
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.560]   is just something like, "Whoa."
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.880]   Like clearly you're disappointed.
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.080]   I get that.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.560]   I believe you.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.200]   And I know there's another way you can say that to me.
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.200]   That's actually right back to family jobs.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.300]   I'm validating and I'm setting kind of a boundary
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:47.140]   in some ways.
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:48.560]   Like I know maybe there's a hope there too.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.840]   Like I know there's another way.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.840]   If my kid keeps saying, "I hate you, I hate you,
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.120]   "you're the worst, you're the worst."
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.260]   And I'm gonna say, "Listen, I love you.
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:57.280]   "You're a good kid, you're having a hard time.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.100]   "I really won't stay in your room
[01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.240]   "while you keep saying this to me."
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.960]   And part of that is 'cause it's not good for you either.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.160]   Like this isn't a good dynamic.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.000]   I'm gonna step outside, I'm gonna come back,
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.120]   and we can talk about it when we're both in a place
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.320]   where we can be a little more respectful
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.600]   or something like that, right?
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.420]   You don't have to be a punching bag.
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:16.040]   But at least now I'm helping my kid see
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.800]   that he is having a feeling under these words.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.680]   If I can't differentiate the feeling from the behavior,
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:26.800]   how can I expect my kid to ever learn
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.460]   to differentiate those two?
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:30.620]   Which is how my kid can actually get
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:32.560]   to a more regulated place.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.260]   - I've sometimes wondered whether or not parents
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:40.260]   are either afraid of or not afraid enough of their kids.
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:45.600]   I've known some parents that are afraid of their kids
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.360]   because, and perhaps as a consequence,
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.240]   who knows what the chicken egg is there.
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.280]   All we know is the parent was alive first.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:57.160]   The kids learn to control their parents
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.320]   through not necessarily emotional outbursts,
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.440]   but the threat of emotional outbursts.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.160]   I've seen this again and again,
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.740]   and it's a pretty wild thing to observe.
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:11.140]   And of course, as an observer,
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:12.960]   it's far easier than when you're in it.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.640]   But this idea like, well, like they're like a pop ready
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:21.640]   to boil over, you know, like they're going to pop.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:25.040]   And I've seen this in teachers in the classroom.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.040]   I've seen this in so many venues where whether or not
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:33.360]   the child understands that they're somehow controlling
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.580]   the situation or not, that there's just an inherent fear
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.120]   of what could happen.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.160]   And then I think kids feel a certain power,
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.680]   but they don't feel safe, right?
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.080]   I mean, how could they, right?
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.080]   Their children.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.080]   - Yes.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.360]   - So for the parents out there that are afraid
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.860]   of their kids' potential responses
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:55.920]   and or how bad their kid, quote unquote, might turn out
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.200]   if they were to really lay down the law.
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.240]   Here I'm using kind of old school language.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.140]   Listen, I grew up, you know, I'm 48 years old.
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:06.920]   So, you know, I, yeah, I mean, my parents, you know,
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.680]   didn't physically abuse it, but there might've been
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.120]   a spanking every once in a while,
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.840]   or I don't know what the rule is nowadays
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.360]   or the standard out there.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:16.160]   You know, I think I won't say which,
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:20.680]   but I might've taken a smack here or there, but not many.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:24.940]   And it, there was also a lot of love, but clearly,
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:28.800]   and here I'm not supporting the use of corporal punishment.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:33.360]   I want to be very clear, but you know, kids can be tough.
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.100]   And then also, you know, it wasn't long
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:38.160]   into my high school years when I was physically larger
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.000]   than both my parents, I never used that to intimidate them.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.960]   But I have to imagine when your kid is larger than you,
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:45.720]   if you were already psychologically afraid of them,
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.880]   now you, it's clear to both of you
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.760]   that the tables have turned.
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:51.680]   - That's right. - Right?
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.440]   I'm talking about the unconscious,
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.160]   semi-conscious aspects of this.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.920]   I'm not talking about who can, you know,
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.880]   obviously physical fights, there's not something
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.000]   I ever want to see or participate in in a household.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.080]   - So this is an amazing topic, like walking on eggshells.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:05.920]   This is right.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:10.960]   And this is terrifying to a kid, because again,
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.680]   if a kid is trying to figure out like,
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.200]   am I real and am I safe?
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:19.320]   Kids do experience feelings in such an intense way,
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.680]   because they don't have any of those skills
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.920]   and they're so surprising and they're so visceral,
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.540]   that it is scary to them.
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:27.060]   And there are kind of, especially these groups of kids,
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:29.280]   I call them deeply feeling kids,
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.960]   that do feel things more intensely.
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.800]   And they do have more of these big, massive tantrums.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.440]   They even look animalistic often during,
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.540]   they try to scratch you, they'll hiss during them,
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:40.120]   they'll growl. - Hiss, really?
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.160]   - Yes.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:44.320]   - I grew up with some biters, kids that bite.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.800]   - Yes, because again, those are just feelings
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.040]   literally uncontained that are exploding out.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.080]   And where do they explode out?
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:50.920]   Through your extremities.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:53.120]   So that's really what it is.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.000]   And so what will happen,
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.880]   and this is this really unfortunate dance,
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:00.280]   one of my favorite things to help people turn around,
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:03.600]   is then kids kind of sense from a parent,
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.740]   like, I really am as toxic as I worried I was.
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:09.720]   Right?
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.160]   And again, if we go back to that pilot thing,
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.400]   like I think about a pilot,
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:16.600]   it's like, we have to make an emergency landing.
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.620]   We're not gonna be able to go to LA.
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:22.080]   And we're all gonna land in Cleveland, whatever it is.
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.040]   I picture the passenger who's like,
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.960]   you are going to take us to LA.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:29.240]   And the pilot's like, okay, okay.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.480]   Can you imagine?
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.520]   You're like, it doesn't matter that this person is pissed.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.800]   Like, you're the pilot.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.440]   You don't have to keep us happy.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.040]   Please keep us safe.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.920]   And if you're on that plane and you're terrified
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.640]   because you're like, we have to make an emergency landing,
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.960]   I promise you, you're way more terrified
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:48.960]   when you hear this person change the decision
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.360]   because of the threat that a passenger
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.060]   is going to be very, very upset.
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.040]   And that is actually what we do
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.680]   when we're walking around on eggshells.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.480]   Now, the alternative to this, again,
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.240]   we live in this world in parenting
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:03.840]   where there's a binary, where we say,
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.440]   and you said it yourself, so I'm gonna lay down the law.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:06.960]   Like, I don't recommend that either.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.720]   Like, especially with a kid like that,
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.560]   that's not gonna be the best solution.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.320]   These kids have to be seen as good kids.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.440]   They are good kids.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.720]   And when I meet with parents of these kids,
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.160]   I hear about them.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.880]   And like, I always say I hear about them.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.240]   And I have a kid like this, so I get it.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.080]   And I'm just like, I really like your kid.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.160]   And they're like, what?
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.160]   I was like, I do.
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:29.600]   And they're like, and then they usually start crying.
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.960]   And they go, you're literally the first person
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:35.520]   in 11 years who's ever said that.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.360]   Including, like, the parents.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.160]   Like, you like our kid, why?
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.120]   I'm like, they're tenacious.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.400]   They know what they want.
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.600]   They seem like they have 0% people pleasing in them.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.480]   These kids will change the world.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.880]   But not if they're boundaryless.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.400]   Then they'll become tyrants.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.320]   And that's really terrifying.
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:59.400]   And I'm gonna teach you how to be the sturdy leader,
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.360]   which is equally firm, as it is warm.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.840]   And that's gonna start today.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:06.720]   And so, like, here's an example
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.400]   of these deeply-feeling kids.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.240]   I think you said something about, like,
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.000]   watching, like, a TV show, where these kids,
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.200]   it feels like they hold the family
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.400]   emotionally hostage, right?
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.880]   And because if you don't pick the movie
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.040]   that they wanna watch on family movie night,
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.280]   they will scream, they will cry,
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.600]   and they will do that for three hours.
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.440]   They will.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.640]   Other kids after, you know, like,
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.600]   they don't peter out, these kids.
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.000]   These kids, interestingly enough,
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.880]   get in an awful cycle with their parents,
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.360]   because they have such intense emotions more often,
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.680]   which more escalations,
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.560]   which tend to get met with invalidation.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.080]   You're so dramatic.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.800]   You ruin everything.
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.440]   They are that much more desperate to be believed.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.920]   They escalate further.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.600]   You can understand how that will lead to
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.040]   more distance and invalidation.
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:52.360]   And we're off to the races in a bad direction.
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.240]   And I would say to the parents,
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.760]   you're gonna, during family movie night,
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.760]   tomorrow night, this is what you're gonna do.
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.120]   And you're gonna, by the way, I would say,
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.720]   this is how concrete I get.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.560]   You're gonna write this down,
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.160]   and you're gonna say it to a voice recorder
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.000]   with your own voice.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:03.960]   And I want you to play it back,
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.640]   and see how sturdy you sound.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.700]   And they'll often do it, and they'll be like,
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.520]   wow, I didn't even believe myself when I said that.
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.120]   I'm so scared of my child, right?
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:10.960]   You're gonna do it again.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:11.800]   And then you're gonna do it again.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.120]   And this is just like any other skill we practice.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.460]   And you're gonna say to your kid,
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.680]   look, I know in this family, you know,
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:19.200]   Bobby, usually we let him pick the movie.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.120]   He gets really upset.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.120]   If not, we all, tonight's gonna be different.
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.420]   Bobby, it is your sister's turn to pick the movie.
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:27.520]   And I know you're gonna be upset.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.360]   And I just wanna tell you exactly what's gonna happen.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.960]   And I'm gonna, in this example,
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.320]   I'm saying there's a two-family household,
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:35.080]   which is an assumption, but even if there's one.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.840]   Say, if you're super upset and screaming,
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:39.200]   I'm going to bring you to your room.
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.480]   And this is important.
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:43.920]   I'm gonna sit with you, and I'm gonna stay there.
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.880]   And this is a line that I know
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.280]   from our Deeply Failing Kid workshop has really,
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.520]   and you have to believe it to say it.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:55.080]   I am not scared of your feelings.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.920]   And I know parents will say to me,
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.200]   Dr. Becky, I am scared of their feelings.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.200]   I'm like, yeah, you're gonna fake it till you make it.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.920]   They need to hear that.
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:06.520]   Because if you think about the image of these kids,
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:09.080]   their feelings feel so overpowering to them.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:10.680]   They feel more, but they're actually more
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:14.680]   porous to the world, so they both have more coming in.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.100]   And they're actually always terrified
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:17.840]   of how much of them can flow out.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.560]   And so they feel their feelings in that way.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.160]   It's almost like my tantrum in the house
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.720]   takes up the entire living room.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:25.080]   That's why you actually have to bring them to a smaller room.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:28.680]   And you actually have to contain them in that way
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:33.360]   as a way of kind of saying, it only goes this far,
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.480]   like literally.
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:37.440]   I will not let you dictate family movie
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.200]   and always sitting in the front seat
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.400]   and your favorite chair at dinner.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.740]   It only goes this far.
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:46.200]   And that is truly an act of love and protection
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:48.480]   and safety for those kids.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:53.360]   - How often do you observe that these Deeply Feeling Kids,
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.160]   is that how they're referred to?
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:58.120]   - I made up the term, so, but yeah, Deeply Feeling Kids.
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:01.000]   - You are qualified to, qualified to.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   So Deeply Feeling Kids also express these deep feelings
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.240]   in the positive sense.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.440]   I mean, 'cause I can think of some kids I grew up with
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:15.460]   and I can look at my own experience of like,
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.440]   it's hard to know, we don't have a calibration point.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:20.280]   It's not like body temperature of like how much I feel
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.200]   versus how much you feel.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.060]   We look at the external expression of these things,
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:26.460]   like did the lacrimal glands secrete some tears or not?
[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:28.720]   Like, you know, as you were talking about this thing
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.600]   before I'd noticed, I like weld up a little bit
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.900]   and I'm thinking, yeah, like I can remember seeing things
[01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:37.200]   and feeling things and like, whoa, it's a really big inside.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.040]   I don't remember screaming at my parents,
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:40.620]   telling them I hate them.
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:42.060]   I probably did at some point.
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:47.060]   But I have observed other kids, peers that grew up
[01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:52.040]   that clearly fell into this category.
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:56.680]   And have gone on to do remarkable things, remarkable,
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:00.520]   like extraordinary things because it's a capacity
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:04.000]   that doesn't always skew towards a negative expression.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.080]   It can also like immense expressions of love.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:09.760]   And, you know, I think these days that there's a tendency
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.760]   to, for unqualified or like truly unqualified people
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.200]   because they're not trained to do so,
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.380]   to slap labels like borderline, right?
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:20.680]   Splitting, like good object, bad object, splitting.
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:24.160]   And indeed that exists as a diagnosis
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:26.080]   and symptoms of borderline.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:30.720]   But that we punish rather than believe and observe
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:31.840]   that these things exist.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.480]   There's range in nervous system tuning and affect.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:39.160]   And so put simply, do deeply feeling kids
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:44.160]   also tend to express love and joy and positive emotions
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.960]   with the same intensity or near same intensity?
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.600]   - I would say it depends on like,
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:53.600]   it depends on kind of their stage of development
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.720]   and the nature of the interactions
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.280]   they've kind of received back.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.800]   I think deeply feeling kids, I always say are super sensors.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.080]   Like if you have one of these kids
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:04.040]   and I have one of these kids, we live in New York City,
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.480]   she will not go into New York City garage, okay?
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:07.600]   Like where we park our car.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:08.720]   And she's like, the smell.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.120]   And the rest of us are like, what are you talking about?
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.320]   Meanwhile, I have another friend who lives
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.880]   in totally different area of Manhattan
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:15.800]   and she's a deeply feeling kid.
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:18.680]   She's like, my daughter, the same thing.
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.240]   Like I actually believe that my daughter smells something
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.920]   that I don't smell.
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:25.120]   Like they are super sensors in that way, right?
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:28.520]   And she notices the little detail of something.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.120]   Now, in terms of the intense love,
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.240]   I think for these kids,
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:36.080]   their vulnerability sits so close to their shame.
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:37.680]   This is why they get so explosive.
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:39.880]   They almost experience their feelings as attackers,
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:42.600]   which is again, why parents can get scared of them.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.680]   And they do.
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:45.920]   Because again, they feel that feeling so intensely
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:48.520]   that they have this deep fear of abandonment,
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.800]   of being too much.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.400]   And so that shame tries to shut it down,
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.840]   although it obviously doesn't work and it explodes.
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.840]   What I've noticed with deeply feeling kids,
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:57.960]   and this to me is actually like,
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.840]   truly my proudest body of work.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.480]   And you mentioned borderline, so I'll go there.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.640]   People have said like, these sound almost like kids
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:09.240]   who are like, have some predilection to borderline.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.560]   And obviously having gone to a PhD program,
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:13.840]   we're told a lot about invalidating environments
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:14.680]   and things like that.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.040]   I'm not really one for labels either.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.600]   But I just got so much insight from honestly my own kid
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.640]   where I was like, wow, like she is so different
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.840]   in how she processes things and what she needs
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:27.320]   and how she responds to my very same interactions
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:28.160]   as my other kids.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.920]   Like they're very different.
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.440]   And that fear of abandonment and being too much,
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.520]   it was like they're from the start.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.960]   It really feels like it was like there.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:39.920]   What's so interesting is I feel like through working
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:41.320]   with her, by the way, in a very different way,
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.800]   'cause these kids reject
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.920]   almost every typical parenting strategy.
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:47.400]   You go to validate these kids' feelings,
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.200]   it's like you're trying to intrude on them
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.040]   and steal their heart.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.280]   Because if you think about their porousness,
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.080]   they're so terrified of being taken over
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.640]   that when you're like seeing a feeling,
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:57.280]   they feel like you're like seeing into them.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.920]   And so they reject you.
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.280]   I always say, you can't go in the front door
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.120]   with these kids.
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.800]   You've gotta like find these side door approaches.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:08.800]   But now of all my kids, she is by far the cuddliest,
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:14.040]   the most loving, the most emphatic about our relationship.
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:16.640]   This trip now, I'm gonna miss you so much.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.960]   The idea when she was four that any of that,
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.600]   I would say to someone like, you are crazy.
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.200]   You are talking about a different kid.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:28.000]   So I think that yes, that deep love is there
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.960]   and we just have to kind of make it a little safer
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.400]   for those kids to access it.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.040]   - Is there any kind of general statements
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:39.000]   that one can still make accurately
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.080]   about differences in the expression
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:44.280]   or perhaps even the experience of deeply feeling kids
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.960]   in boys versus girls?
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.880]   - Hmm, great question.
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:55.520]   I actually haven't noticed a ton, but there might be.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.760]   I'd love to look more into that.
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:58.480]   But in terms of, I wanna be accurate,
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.920]   I haven't noticed that yet.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:00.920]   I think one of the things,
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.680]   you know you have one of these kids
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:06.320]   is if you know the moments when you're a parent
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.160]   where your kid like needs you.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:12.600]   And in those moments, your kids push you away.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:16.220]   They push you away when they need you the most.
[01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:20.520]   If that's like, I think a really common quality
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:22.240]   for those kids.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:25.640]   - And how common is this?
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:28.600]   I sound like such a, like a biologist,
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.960]   this deeply feeling kid phenotype.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.040]   I don't wanna, you know,
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.120]   I don't wanna lessen the importance
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:39.440]   of what you're saying by saying it that way,
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.120]   because actually what I think you're saying
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.600]   is incredibly important,
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.560]   resonates with me on a lot of different levels in fact.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:49.920]   So, but as far as I know, it's not a DSM diagnosis
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.400]   and thank goodness it's not,
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.660]   because that would pathologize it, right?
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:54.760]   - Yup.
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.320]   - So, but you know, of the, you know, in a classroom,
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.000]   let's say in a big classroom, a hundred kids.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.160]   - Yeah.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.880]   - How many of those kids,
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.240]   and I'm guessing it's a continuum,
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:09.320]   but would fall into this category of deeply feeling?
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:11.180]   - I think you're right, it's a continuum.
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:15.240]   And connecting topics I know you've spoken about,
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:18.720]   I've been doing a lot of looking into this overlap
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:23.320]   with deeply feeling kids and neurodivergence and ADHD.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.160]   And what I think is interesting about that
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.520]   is we have these workshops,
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.720]   these deeply feeling kid workshops,
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.280]   and a lot of them we do live
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.720]   and there's this whole chat, right?
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.800]   And I'll say these things, people like that, you know,
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:35.120]   and they're definitely ideas they haven't heard,
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.200]   but what I think is more healing
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:40.640]   is thousands of people in the chat and saying,
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.280]   I thought, when I say the hissing thing,
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:45.120]   the chat is like a waterfall.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:46.140]   I thought I was the only one.
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:49.860]   I thought, so like, there are so many of these kids.
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:51.360]   Why I think there's more and more
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.000]   is something I need to look more into,
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.760]   but I think it does really,
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.520]   if you think about these kids as more porous
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:00.040]   and you think about how insanely stimulating the world is
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:03.620]   that we bring up kids, what comes into them,
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:07.040]   it would make sense that I think this is like a growing type.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.460]   I'm guessing it's similar with ADHD too.
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:11.860]   I have so many more kids diagnosed than in the past.
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:14.980]   The world we bring up kids in, the sensory overload,
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:17.660]   if you're kind of that much more porous,
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:21.700]   that's going to overload your system.
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:24.860]   And, you know, and I think that's also
[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:25.980]   why more and more kids are.
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:27.020]   So what's the percentage?
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:30.700]   I don't know, like maybe 20?
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.060]   But don't call me on that. - That's a fairly
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:32.900]   high percentage. - I do.
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:34.260]   I think it's a fairly high percentage.
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:35.740]   - But that feels right.
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:36.960]   It just sort of feels right,
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.940]   based on my observation of adults also.
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:40.520]   - Yeah.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:41.360]   - Feels right.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.760]   Might also explain a lot of the apparent conflicts
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:48.580]   and misunderstandings in adult relationships.
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:51.500]   - That's ex, and we, I mean, so many people,
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:53.660]   like they'll say to me, I was, oh my goodness.
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:56.260]   Like that was like years of therapy for me watching that.
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:57.500]   I thought I would took that for my kid.
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:58.340]   Like this was me.
[01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:00.460]   And I finally talk about, I believe you.
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:03.620]   That's what, I mean, deeply feeling kids are desperate
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:06.460]   to be believed and they're desperate for our attempts
[01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:08.780]   to connect with them because their deep fear
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:10.260]   is their unlovability.
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:12.920]   And so they do reject typical, you know, it's a stance.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:13.760]   Get out of my room.
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:15.020]   Fine, you're so difficult.
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:16.940]   And then see, I really am as unlovable and bad
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:18.660]   as I worried I was, right?
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:20.880]   Unless we kind of reverse that cycle.
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:22.060]   - I'd be willing to bet my life
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:25.020]   that most of the ultra successful performing artists
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:28.460]   that we observe, you know, I'm not gonna name names,
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:29.960]   but just think of ultra successful
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:34.640]   that the people whose words, music, poetry, writing, acting,
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:40.540]   presence evokes immense emotion in other people,
[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:42.920]   so much that people will pay money
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:45.740]   to see these people express their emotions
[01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:47.540]   and what's inside them fall
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:48.940]   into this deeply feeling category.
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:49.780]   - 100%.
[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:51.660]   - I mean, it just can't be any other way.
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:52.500]   - Right.
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:56.900]   - Yeah, the muted performer, unless that's the shtick,
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:59.660]   so to speak, is just not compelling.
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:00.580]   - Yeah.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:02.660]   - Yeah, and a lot of what we're talking today
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:07.160]   is about the kind of tuning fork nature of emotions.
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:10.420]   It's a, wow, what a tricky balance.
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:12.860]   Speaking of that, I'd like to just return
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:15.220]   to something I raised earlier, and then I made the mistake.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:17.120]   It was my fault of shutting the hatch on it.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.760]   I'd like to reopen that hatch,
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:21.440]   which is when there's two parents.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:24.480]   Maybe they're under the same roof, maybe they're not.
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.300]   Or let's just say two caretakers.
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:30.840]   So kids are pretty darn good
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:33.180]   at figuring out who to go to for what
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:37.400]   and how to balance out negative experiences
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.180]   by seeking out the positive reinforcement of the other,
[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.580]   sometimes even pitting parents
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:44.300]   and caretakers against one another.
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:46.800]   I mean, it makes children sound diabolical,
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.840]   but adults do it too.
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:49.880]   It's called gossip.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:57.560]   What can co-parents, co-caretakers do
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:02.380]   to try and align strategies,
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:06.520]   or if necessary, to offset some bad stuff
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:07.600]   that the other parent might be doing?
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.740]   And in today's landscape,
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:11.920]   where it's about 50% of marriages end in divorce,
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:12.960]   at least in the US,
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:14.560]   you also have the situation
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:17.900]   where then there are new significant others come in,
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:19.660]   and now you've extended the landscape
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:22.740]   to sometimes five or six different parents.
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:25.540]   My family's, my biological family,
[01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:26.580]   starting to look like the UN.
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:28.100]   We've got so many countries and religions,
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:30.000]   and this thing, it's kind of nice on the one hand,
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.640]   but lots of divergence of opinion
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:34.460]   and emotional stance and background.
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:38.580]   So how in the world do we wrap our efforts around this?
[01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:39.700]   - Yeah.
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:43.340]   So one of the most common questions I get
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:45.660]   from a parent at Good Inside is like,
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:47.560]   can you convince my partner
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:49.420]   why the way they do things is wrong?
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:52.020]   And do things more like Good Inside.
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:53.340]   And so essentially I always say like,
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:54.620]   yeah, I'm not, for a million reasons,
[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:57.020]   I'm not too interested in taking that phone call.
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:58.760]   But-
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:01.700]   - Yeah, I don't get involved in couple disputes either.
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:02.640]   - But again, assuming,
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.260]   and you've said this a couple of times, which I love,
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:07.140]   I'm assuming the way you're a kind of partner
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:08.820]   or the co-parent does things
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:11.080]   is not really damaging your child.
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:13.060]   Obviously that's really time for an intervention.
[01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.420]   - No hitting, no emotional abuse.
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:15.260]   - Exactly.
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:19.300]   But even I'm not a believer of saying,
[01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:20.420]   for a timeout, right?
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:22.100]   Like I don't believe in timeouts and punishments.
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:24.340]   I don't think they feel good to kids or parents.
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:26.100]   And I also don't think they're effective.
[01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:28.660]   - No, so timeout's not effective.
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:29.820]   - I don't think so.
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:30.660]   - Okay.
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:32.900]   And we probably should have closed the hatch on.
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:35.700]   I have to imagine that the going word
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:39.140]   in the profession of psychology and raising kids properly
[01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:41.580]   is you never spank them, you never hit them.
[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:42.420]   - Yeah, no.
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:43.340]   - Okay, all right, for the record.
[01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:44.420]   - So maybe we'll get back there,
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:45.580]   but just to go on the record,
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:48.300]   and I think you can sense from my style,
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:50.380]   not punishing for timeouts,
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:53.140]   like doesn't mean you're permissive at all.
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:57.060]   There's 0% permissive or even softness, I think.
[01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:59.460]   There's softness, there's 0% permissive in those moments,
[01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:00.540]   but we can get back there.
[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:02.660]   But let's say your partner does do that,
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.300]   or the co-parent, right?
[01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:07.140]   Like I would be the first to say to someone like,
[01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:09.620]   do I think that that's like messing up your kid?
[01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:12.180]   I don't, I really don't.
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:16.100]   Especially if, for example, in that situation,
[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:20.140]   let's say I'm divorced and my now ex,
[01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:22.060]   I just know that they do timeouts or this,
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:23.660]   and I've tried to talk to them,
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:26.540]   but whatever, they're not getting on board with the style.
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:29.100]   And to me, what happens is like,
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:30.300]   you have a kid, they come back to you,
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:33.580]   and they're like, "Papa gave me a timeout,
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:34.700]   "and we don't do that in my house."
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:37.500]   And my first thing is I call my ex.
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:38.420]   That's usually what I do.
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:39.820]   Or the school did this, and I called the school.
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:41.900]   I called the ex, and I'm like, "Why did you do that?
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:43.700]   "We don't do that."
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:45.180]   What I think is really important,
[01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:48.100]   and I actually find it very like relieving as a parent,
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:50.140]   be like, what's actually most important
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:53.100]   is helping my kid understand their experience.
[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:56.020]   Like we center the other person
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:58.420]   and what they're doing wrong,
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:00.940]   instead of centering our kid.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:03.380]   We might need to call a parent, the other parent,
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:05.220]   and say like, "Hey, it would be really great
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:06.300]   "to get on the same page.
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:07.980]   "Could we do this course together?
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:08.820]   "That would just be great.
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:09.700]   "You don't have to agree with anything.
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:11.100]   "I think that would be great."
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:13.660]   But in that moment, what my kid needs, actually,
[01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:18.140]   is more like, wait, that's kind of hard, confusing.
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:20.100]   So like in our house, when you do something,
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:22.420]   like you scream, "I hate you,"
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:23.780]   I intervene in one way.
[01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:25.620]   And when you go to your dad's house,
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:27.020]   he intervenes in a very different way.
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:28.420]   It's a lot of like,
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:30.620]   that's a lot of switching to make sense of.
[01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:33.380]   Or maybe my kid says,
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:36.340]   "Mom never apologizes to me after she yells."
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:38.980]   And I would call, or maybe it's my own wife,
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:41.400]   and I'm like, "Hey, you know the importance of repair.
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:44.080]   "Haven't you listened to all this literature?"
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:46.980]   You know, I would like to have some influence on that.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:49.360]   But what I feel like my kid needs in the moment
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.300]   is more like, "Tell me what happened.
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:53.800]   "Oh, oh, she yelled at you."
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:57.240]   And yeah, look, something I know mom was,
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.860]   I know she had a really stressful day at work.
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:00.980]   And look, this isn't your responsibility,
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:01.900]   but you can just know this.
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:05.440]   Mom has a really hard time apologizing to her,
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:07.600]   has a really hard time apologizing.
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.620]   And actually, when people have a hard time apologizing,
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:11.900]   they seem cold and they don't care,
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:14.920]   they actually usually just feel so ashamed of what they did.
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.220]   And the reason I'm telling you that
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:18.120]   is not because you have to take care of her,
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:20.480]   but just so you know, this so wasn't you.
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:22.700]   And any time something happens with mom
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:24.140]   that doesn't feel good,
[01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:25.240]   and you feel like you can't resolve it,
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.080]   you can talk to me.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.680]   And I'm gonna get out of role play for a sec,
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:28.520]   but I think you can see,
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:32.540]   I'm not throwing my wife under the bus at all.
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:35.100]   But I'm centering what my kid needs.
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:36.400]   What my kid needs, going back,
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:40.360]   is they need to process that experience with an adult
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:43.600]   they feel safe with, rather than being aloneness.
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.680]   And I often picture this kid on the couch
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:48.680]   who tells me a problem at their dad's house or at school,
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.320]   and I go off to make a call,
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.000]   and I picture them alone being like,
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.720]   "Oh, now I'm alone, I didn't really want you to go do that.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:58.520]   I just wanted you to listen to me."
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.600]   There might then be a step, too,
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.060]   to kind of get on the same page.
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:04.000]   Or when parents say, "Get on the same page,"
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.400]   I think the problem is that we're not looking
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:07.240]   at the same page.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:08.480]   Forget getting on the same page.
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.840]   We're not even speaking the same language.
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:11.680]   People will say to me,
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:13.680]   "My partner won't even watch a video with me.
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:15.400]   I just wanna, even if they disagree."
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:16.360]   That is the problem.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.920]   And frankly, that's not a parenting problem.
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:20.440]   That's also what I'll say to someone.
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.220]   If you say to your partner,
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:24.160]   "Look, I've been a member of Good Inside
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:26.380]   and it's been really helpful and it resonates,
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:27.800]   and you don't have to agree with it,
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:31.140]   but I would love to watch this four-minute video."
[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:34.300]   If your partner says no, that has nothing to do
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:37.700]   with parenting, that is a core relationship problem,
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:40.060]   that they just don't care to do something
[01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.460]   that you say is important to you.
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:43.540]   That's a marriage problem.
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:44.960]   That's all, right?
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:46.220]   And I think it's really important.
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:47.340]   And we talk about this a lot.
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:49.200]   If that was someone I'd coach them to say,
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:51.100]   "Hey, and you don't have to agree,
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:53.980]   but if you don't commit to watching a four-minute video
[01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:55.660]   with me and just talking about it a little bit,
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:58.300]   and I promise I'll try not to be judgy or prove-y,
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:36:59.240]   I'll just listen,
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:01.620]   I don't really think we're talking about parenting.
[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:04.620]   I think you're telling me you don't really respect me enough
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:06.460]   to do the things I'm asking you to do."
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:09.320]   And that'll stick with me.
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:10.820]   That's the way I'd handle it.
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:13.500]   - Yeah, this is very helpful.
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:20.020]   I'm curious about these ADHD diagnoses/kids,
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:25.180]   'cause there's a lot of loose hand diagnosis these days.
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:29.420]   Years ago, I was a camp counselor, took kids backpacking,
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:31.300]   and I learned an important concept
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:35.340]   of when working with adolescent and teenage boys,
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:39.020]   which is be a channel, not a dam.
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:43.600]   When they're super energetic, they're not sitting still.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.420]   Where it's not nap time, there's just no way.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:48.900]   So this notion of getting it out,
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:51.260]   like allowing some place for physical
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:53.940]   or emotional catharsis that's safe, obviously,
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:56.940]   and that kids have a lot of energy.
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.860]   I mean, dammit, the adult population
[01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:01.220]   seems to be trying to regress themselves
[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:02.480]   to have that energy.
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:04.900]   So how can we blame them for having so much energy?
[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:07.620]   And of course, there are children who have,
[01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:10.180]   and adults with clinically diagnosed ADHD
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:11.660]   that really struggle.
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:16.660]   But for the kid that's more energetic,
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:18.940]   maybe even has a hard time sitting still
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:20.380]   to the point of discomfort,
[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:23.140]   and when the rest of the world that we can't control
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:27.660]   is telling them, "Hey, your kid needs to be regulated
[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:29.900]   on the subway, on the bus, in the classroom."
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:32.660]   What are some things that we can do
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:35.420]   in terms of communication with those kids?
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:39.100]   And probably some of those kids are listening as well.
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:41.500]   And to just be a channel, not a dam,
[01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:44.420]   to allow their best expression to come forward.
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:45.300]   - Yeah.
[01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:47.140]   I mean, I love this idea in general.
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:52.840]   It's much more effective to tell anyone what they can do
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:55.380]   rather than telling them what they can't do.
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:56.420]   Across the board with kids,
[01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:59.740]   because there's usually a can, that is possible.
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:03.140]   And then you can work with the urge instead of,
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:04.740]   I don't even know, trying to suppress it
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:06.140]   or have it not act itself out.
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.700]   It's like, our urges and feelings, our forces,
[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:10.660]   they're gonna come out.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:13.560]   And so, yes, I think this idea of me and my kid
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:14.700]   are on the same team here.
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:16.280]   I think that's so important to start with.
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:17.740]   Any kid, definitely, if you have a kid
[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:20.900]   with some intentional struggles, we're on the same team.
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:22.920]   You can so easily get into me against you.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.440]   And then you look to shut down everything about them.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.560]   But yeah, we're on the same team.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.400]   So let's say it's hard to do homework right now.
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:32.100]   I see you, okay, let's take an amount of time.
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:34.640]   And it seems like you have a lot of energy.
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:38.180]   Let's do some heavy work or let's run outside.
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:40.960]   And maybe homework always has to start
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:42.660]   after a period like that.
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:43.820]   Maybe they need a break.
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:47.560]   But this idea of, yes, I'm working with my kid
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.940]   as opposed to against my kid
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:51.700]   is always gonna be more successful.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.620]   - Do you think that some of the new emerging tools,
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:57.860]   some of which I've talked a lot about,
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:00.640]   but many, many people have talked a lot about,
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:02.840]   things like meditation,
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:05.080]   kids doing some long exhale breathing.
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:08.500]   In addition to the way I grew up,
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:10.060]   it was like pee time or recess time.
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:11.280]   You're like running around like crazy.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.780]   And do you think that these tools
[01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:18.200]   are helping kids get some self-regulation
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:21.380]   or is whatever self-regulation
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:23.520]   they're gaining offset by the fact
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:26.800]   that there's just so much more input.
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:29.560]   We hear so much about the challenges of social media
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:32.200]   for adults, but certainly for kids.
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:38.020]   Bullying, obviously being one of the more salient ones,
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:40.100]   but also just the fact that when they go home at night
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:40.940]   and they're in bed,
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.420]   they're potentially still in interactions
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:43.260]   with their friends.
[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:44.620]   We used to have a phone landline
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:46.760]   that we'd sometimes call one another on,
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:50.760]   but I wasn't really much of a phone kid with my friends.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:53.000]   So when you're home, you're home.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.200]   You were separated from all of that.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:57.860]   I mean, how bad is it?
[01:40:57.860 --> 01:41:00.080]   And what are some things
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:02.680]   that parents and kids might consider?
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:04.720]   - Yeah, to me, meditation, things like that,
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:07.200]   like always like icing on the cake.
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.360]   Like that's always helpful.
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:11.640]   And certainly like teaching kids real tools.
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:14.000]   Like those are like literally something I can do.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.160]   I've learned this meditation.
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.800]   I have a mantra, something like that, like huge fan, right?
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:20.200]   You have to be able to like touch it in some way.
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.540]   But to me, I think what's coming up
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:24.000]   is you bring up this larger point
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.440]   and it actually goes back to where we started.
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:29.840]   It's like the cost to children
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.280]   of parents not being able to set boundaries
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:33.480]   has never been higher.
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:35.440]   And at the same time,
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:37.760]   it's never been harder for parents to set boundaries.
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:40.920]   And I think this stuff starts way before social media.
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:42.460]   Like to me, when I think about the earliest years
[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:43.560]   of a kid's life,
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:48.520]   you get so much bang for your buck in life
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:52.160]   from helping kids just learn to tolerate frustration.
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:54.560]   And so much of kids' early life right now
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:55.800]   in the world we live in
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:59.480]   is all about the immediate escape from frustration.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:01.640]   And not only escape from frustration,
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:04.760]   but from frustration to gratification in like an instant.
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:06.840]   It's like so fast, like how did that just happen?
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.040]   Like it didn't used to be like that.
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:09.080]   There wasn't even an option.
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.600]   Like me and you, like, I don't know, you wanted a movie.
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:12.480]   Like, I don't know,
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:14.280]   maybe your parent could drive you to Blockbuster
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:15.340]   if you had an account.
[01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:17.200]   And then like, maybe, I don't know,
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:19.560]   I remember going and be like, are they going to have it?
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:20.760]   Are they going to have it?
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.520]   And then you see the thing and there's nothing behind it.
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.280]   And you're like, they don't have it.
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.540]   That whole thing- - Blockbuster, by the way,
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:26.580]   was a video store.
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:28.120]   Just kidding, I'm just totally kidding.
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:29.000]   I'm totally kidding.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:29.920]   But some are out there,
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:32.340]   like I sometimes do this to myself, you know?
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:33.180]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:37.560]   I used to love going to pick out movies at the VHS store.
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:39.560]   - But if you think about that as one tiny thing,
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:40.400]   it's obviously tiny,
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:42.740]   and you think about like, I remember that in my childhood.
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:44.120]   Anything about that tiny moment
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:45.880]   compared to some parallel in a kid.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.240]   The, there's no frustration.
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:53.020]   The want and the gratification, there's zero space.
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:54.820]   There is zero space.
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:57.880]   And also I have to say our generation of parents,
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.440]   and me too, 100% me too,
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.660]   our tolerance for frustration has gone way down
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:04.880]   because of the gratification world we live in,
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:08.760]   which means our tolerance of our kids' tantrums
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.020]   is at an all time low.
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:11.940]   Because we're like, hey, my life is like pretty easy
[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:12.780]   in a lot of ways.
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:14.080]   This is like a massive inconvenience.
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:17.600]   So kids have more gratification than ever.
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:21.560]   We have lower tolerances for frustration.
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.580]   Everyone does.
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:24.880]   Which means the way we interact with kids
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:26.160]   over and over and over,
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:29.260]   plus just the natural things they're exposed to or not,
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:32.660]   like Netflix versus Blockbuster,
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:36.960]   just means like their circuitry around expectations
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.460]   and what feels good.
[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:42.540]   Like to me, that's what really, it scares me.
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:43.380]   It does.
[01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:48.380]   And like figuring out how to tolerate
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:54.760]   or even insert, like literally insert frustration
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:59.160]   into your kid's life as early as possible,
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:02.220]   to me is like, is of critical importance.
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:05.200]   - I could not agree more.
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.120]   And I say that with the understanding
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:09.240]   that I have also shortened the latency
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.760]   in my reward prediction errors,
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:13.940]   which is nerd speak for when I want to watch a movie,
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:18.140]   I go into Netflix and they're like, it's near infinite.
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:20.240]   And I can get right then.
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.560]   The internet's a little slow.
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:23.380]   Then I start barking about how slow internet
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:24.560]   is worse than no internet.
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:26.020]   And that, you know, you start observing yourself
[01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:28.540]   and you just go, oh my goodness, like what's going on?
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:33.540]   I mean, the ability to tolerate different wait times
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:37.020]   between anticipation and reward is so critical.
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:39.060]   And that's what getting a degree is about.
[01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:41.800]   That's what doing anything challenging is about.
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.260]   I've gone on record saying that too much dopamine
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:50.020]   without effort exerted in order to get that dopamine
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:52.920]   is very detrimental.
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.240]   - Well, that to me and all the screen time
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:56.960]   kind of discussion, there was so much screen time
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:59.020]   in social media and like all the things
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.900]   that screen time do for kids.
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:03.860]   And again, like my kids watch TV and they're young
[01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:04.700]   and they have iPads.
[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:06.680]   Like I'm so not a purist, I'm a pragmatist.
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:07.880]   And whoever's listening to this,
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:09.380]   no one messed up their kids forever.
[01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:11.460]   So we can just, like we were talking about before,
[01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:13.980]   use this information to make slightly different decisions
[01:45:13.980 --> 01:45:14.820]   on the margin.
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:15.720]   That's the best it gets.
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:17.180]   But I think about this a lot.
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:18.240]   When our kids are especially young
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:20.620]   and they're building this circuitry around like,
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:22.540]   what does it mean to get success?
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:24.580]   Like what are my expectations there?
[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:27.100]   How much effort do I have to put in?
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:29.620]   And I think about like a young kid, you know,
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:33.180]   playing some mindless, just dopamine giving game.
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:38.180]   The circuit they learn is like, mindlessness, zero effort,
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:39.200]   dopamine.
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:43.800]   And then I think, and I find this really interesting,
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:48.360]   like how many people say like their kid is six now,
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:50.800]   having a really hard time learning how to read.
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:52.160]   And they're getting all these learning assessments
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:53.920]   and the learning assessments are coming back,
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:56.080]   like no dyslexia, right?
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:56.920]   And I know some of these families,
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:59.280]   and I say this with love, is I literally think
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:02.520]   this is the first time in this kid's life
[01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:07.020]   that they kind of have to put like concerted effort
[01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:10.140]   without in the moment success.
[01:46:10.140 --> 01:46:15.640]   And so, yeah, that like, that looks like a lot of things.
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:20.060]   It can even present like ADHD, right?
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:23.020]   Because you know, it can present like that, it might be.
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:26.380]   But it might also just be that these dopamine circuits
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:30.860]   have developed in a way that's not conducive
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:33.480]   with something like learning how to read, right?
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.320]   And so when parents ask me now, like I know reading
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:37.760]   and academic skills, like what can I do
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:39.520]   when my kids are younger, I got them flashcards,
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:41.480]   no flashcards, like, I mean, you can get flashcards,
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:42.860]   that's fine, it's not like detrimental.
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:45.740]   But to me, it's like, well, what is my kid's relationship
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:47.280]   with frustration?
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:49.080]   Because I think about this thing called like
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.280]   the learning space, again, I'm visual,
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:53.540]   like there's not knowing how to do something
[01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:56.240]   and then there's successfully doing something.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:58.540]   And the space in between is like the learning space,
[01:46:58.540 --> 01:46:59.480]   that's what learning is.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:03.160]   And the learning space inherently is frustrating.
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.580]   That's like the right feeling to be feeling.
[01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:09.880]   And when kids have learned to collapse those two things,
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:12.920]   then like they don't have a lot of space to learn.
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:18.220]   Versus, I don't know, even like I'm thinking about my kid
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:21.860]   who wants to like draw a rainbow or sun when they're young.
[01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:23.680]   And they're like, that doesn't look like a sun.
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:25.040]   It would be easy for me to be like,
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.100]   let me just do that for you.
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:28.480]   And by the way, yes, I give myself permission
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:29.320]   to do that sometimes.
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:30.440]   And I was like, I can't deal with this.
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:31.860]   I've got other things to do.
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:35.240]   But sometimes I think like long and that long-term greedy,
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:38.220]   like, oh, this is gonna be the same circuit
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:39.580]   for learning how to read.
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:42.400]   It is, and for learning how to do that project.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:45.960]   And what if my only goal, forget them drawing a sun
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.660]   and I've got to tolerate the whining.
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:50.680]   My only goal was just to lengthen the amount of time
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:53.040]   they let themselves be in that learning space.
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:53.880]   That's it.
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:55.820]   Because I think we know as adults,
[01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:57.120]   it's not about getting to success.
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:58.400]   That comes when it comes.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:01.400]   The longer amount of time you let yourself
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:02.760]   be in that learning space,
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:04.640]   the more successful you can be with hard things.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:05.880]   'Cause like, it just is right.
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:07.920]   You just got to traverse through.
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:09.240]   And so to me, that's like, honestly,
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:11.160]   one of the things I'm most passionate about teaching parents
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:12.400]   is like, literally like,
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:13.880]   what do you do during that time then?
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:15.380]   How do I change what my goal is?
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:17.660]   If my goal is to stop my kid's tantrum,
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:18.820]   I'm gonna collapse it.
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:20.880]   But if my goal is just to lengthen that,
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.000]   I might do something very different.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.720]   Oh, drawing a circle, that's not your right.
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:26.360]   You didn't want to draw that.
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:28.400]   Oh, drawing a circle is so hard.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:29.900]   And my kids, can you do it for me?
[01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:30.740]   Can you do that?
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:32.200]   Like, of course, sometimes I will.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:36.280]   But I might say like, I'm not gonna do it, sweetie.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:37.400]   I'm not, you know why?
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:40.360]   Because I know you can do this a little more.
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:42.400]   I have faith in you.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:45.160]   And I think this is so powerful to say to kids,
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.380]   this is so frustrating.
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:51.080]   And that's the exact way you should be feeling.
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:52.920]   We don't want our kids to be,
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:54.160]   that's the right feeling.
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:56.760]   I'll even draw that learning space visual.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:01.240]   This is where you are, you're doing an amazing job.
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:03.920]   And it is actually interesting when kids are young,
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:06.340]   like they actually do adopt that.
[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:07.180]   Like someone said to me,
[01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:08.280]   "I've been doing this stuff for a while."
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:10.300]   My kid literally says to me,
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:13.160]   "I like to do hard things, Mom."
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:14.360]   Like they believe it.
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:16.280]   Like that's an amazing self-belief
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:17.800]   to develop in a kid. - That's awesome.
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:18.640]   - Right? - That's awesome.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:19.960]   - So yes, I think this stuff,
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:23.960]   especially compared to how easy it is
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:26.160]   to get that gratification,
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.760]   it's like more important than ever to have an offset.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:33.700]   - Yeah, I'm doing my best to get the word out into the world
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:35.780]   that the only reason the brain changes at all
[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:40.620]   is if there is these neuromodulators
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:43.920]   like epinephrine, adrenaline in the body and brain,
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:44.880]   because that's what signals
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:46.900]   that the nervous system needs to change.
[01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:48.880]   If something can be accomplished,
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.760]   there's no reason for the nervous system to change
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:51.900]   by definition.
[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:53.040]   There's also, I don't want to spin off
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:57.680]   into a neuroscience of resilience and willpower lesson here,
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:58.960]   but there's some amazing literature
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:02.380]   that shows that there's this area of the brain,
[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:03.920]   the anterior mid-singulate cortex,
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:06.760]   which is activated when people do things
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:08.040]   they don't want to do.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:11.800]   And it generalizes to other things.
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:13.680]   But this is not the, I love to work out,
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.380]   so I'm going to work out.
[01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:17.840]   This is the, I hate to work out and I do it anyway.
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:22.000]   And it translates to success in academic endeavors,
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.360]   success in all sorts of environments.
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:26.320]   And so I think the beauty of it
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.360]   is that this brain structure is highly plastic
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:30.280]   and can be built up through one thing
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:31.360]   and that translates to others.
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:32.840]   So doing hard things,
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:35.680]   experiencing what I call limbic friction,
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:38.000]   just as a gateway to learning,
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.240]   just understanding that it always feels hard,
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:43.020]   that that's what learning is.
[01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:44.960]   In fact, I can remember in graduate school,
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:47.240]   even as a young adult, my mid-20s,
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.120]   I was struggling with an analysis
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:52.660]   and my graduate advisor, she was wonderful this way.
[01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:54.140]   And I said, she clearly knew how to do it.
[01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:57.900]   And I said, "Can you explain how to do this?"
[01:50:57.900 --> 01:50:59.180]   And she goes, "No."
[01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:02.060]   I was like, "Just get done."
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:04.920]   And she's like, "No, it's called learning."
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:05.760]   And I just walked out.
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:08.500]   She was also a great parent to her children.
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:10.940]   And I also tried to get adopted by her and that failed,
[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:12.740]   so I'm- - Third time's the charm.
[01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:16.280]   - Exactly, my poor parents, they did their best
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:18.020]   and I'm grateful to them for many things.
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:20.780]   But I think that, including the encouragement
[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:23.180]   to do hard things, do things that suck,
[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:25.460]   that are beneficial for us.
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:27.220]   So it's a knife edge, right?
[01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:30.520]   Now I'm reflecting, it's like, do things that suck.
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:32.800]   I believe you, it sucks.
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:35.580]   And then what did my mom used to say a lot?
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:37.020]   Hate me now, love me later.
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:39.820]   I loved her then and I love her now.
[01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:40.940]   But yeah, there were moments where I was like,
[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:43.520]   "I hate that you're making me do this."
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:46.820]   I don't know about the hate me now, love me later.
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:47.920]   Old school.
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:50.060]   But- - But I think
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:50.900]   what she was trying to say is,
[01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:52.500]   "I have your best interest in mind."
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:53.660]   - Definitely. - That's right.
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:55.980]   - Definitely, yeah, no, definitely.
[01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:58.980]   - Can I say one thing just 'cause it's loud in my head.
[01:51:58.980 --> 01:51:59.820]   - Please, please.
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:02.220]   - One of the things, I think it's easy
[01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:04.340]   and I'm hearing myself, we hear this
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:05.720]   and I think it's easy to listen and be like,
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:07.500]   "Oh man, I never thought about it that way."
[01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:08.720]   Or, "I didn't know that."
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:10.580]   Or again, we just spiral as a parent so fast.
[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:11.980]   It's like, "I messed up my kid forever."
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:13.260]   Nobody messed up their kid forever.
[01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:15.140]   It doesn't matter how old, that is just not true.
[01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:17.900]   And this is where I think we can spiral into like,
[01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:19.300]   "Yeah, what's wrong with me?"
[01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:21.860]   And I kind of asked parents in this situation
[01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:24.720]   to come with me to a different location,
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:26.420]   which is kind of anger.
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:28.200]   And I have started to feel angry
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:30.860]   and I think anger tells us what we need.
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:34.060]   So I'm like, "Well, what is that anger telling me?"
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:37.100]   It is messed up, the system is stacked against us
[01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:38.680]   that when you become a parent,
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:41.820]   it is literally the hardest, most confusing,
[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:45.080]   most triggering, most important job we have.
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:49.900]   And we are given zero resources, right?
[01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:54.400]   Like nobody I know would tell a surgeon
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:57.260]   who never went to med school and was struggling at surgery
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:52:58.300]   that they were a bad surgeon.
[01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:02.460]   They'd be like, "Wow, you probably deserve
[01:53:02.460 --> 01:53:04.980]   to go to med school and residency, by the way.
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:06.700]   That's an important job you have."
[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:09.040]   And so I think it's easy to listen to all this
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.940]   and spiral into like, "Oh no."
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:14.060]   But I'd ask you to almost feel a little protective,
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:16.700]   helpful anger next to it, which is like,
[01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:19.340]   "Wow, yes, this is an important job I have.
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:20.520]   This is complicated.
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:24.280]   And maybe there are resources out there that I deserve."
[01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:26.320]   And I think that's the perspective
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:28.260]   I would ask parents to listen from.
[01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:30.220]   - Earlier, you described the job of parenting
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:33.460]   as boundaries, imparting boundaries,
[01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:35.560]   as well as empathy and validation.
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:38.820]   I just want to remind people that your very basic
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:43.100]   but very practical job description for parenting
[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:44.820]   is something that I think we can return to
[01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:46.100]   over and over again.
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:47.360]   It also makes me wonder,
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:52.760]   in thinking about the generalizability of these concepts
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:54.400]   to other forms of relationship,
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:57.020]   what about the relationship to self, right?
[01:53:57.020 --> 01:53:59.820]   It's something we don't often talk about.
[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:03.340]   Relationship to self, we want to have boundaries
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:05.580]   and we also want to be able to empathize
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:07.340]   and validate ourselves.
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.180]   - Yeah.
[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:09.620]   And I think, right, like, I don't know,
[01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:11.700]   my friend didn't invite me.
[01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:14.140]   I don't know, I found out she had five friends for a dinner
[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:16.100]   and I was like, "Oh, you know, I'm so hurt."
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:18.820]   I would say to myself, "I believe myself,
[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:20.700]   like I'm allowed to feel that way."
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:22.900]   I think our feelings love when we tell them they make sense.
[01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:24.580]   I just think there's something magical about that phrase.
[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:25.740]   It makes sense I'm upset.
[01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:27.940]   I mean, my friends were all there and I wasn't.
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:29.340]   That makes sense.
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:32.780]   And there's a boundary, 'cause when my feeling tells me,
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:35.820]   well, I'm about to plan a dinner party for 200 people
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:37.700]   and invite everyone I know but her.
[01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:38.540]   I feel like there's an important,
[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:39.660]   and I'm like, "You know what feeling,
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:42.140]   like I'm not gonna let you go that far."
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:44.380]   And the image I always think about is like,
[01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:45.660]   I'm the driver of my car
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:47.500]   and all the different feelings and urges,
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:48.980]   like they're passengers
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:50.340]   and we can't get them out of the car.
[01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:51.740]   You just can't, they're in your body
[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:55.220]   but you don't wanna let them take over the driver's seat.
[01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:56.140]   That's really what it is.
[01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:57.660]   And as long as they're a passenger,
[01:54:57.660 --> 01:54:59.180]   they actually won't cause you that many problems.
[01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:00.180]   They'll be annoying.
[01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:02.540]   And to me, that's like, "Hey, I see you, like I see you."
[01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:05.100]   And I will often say hi to my feelings for that reason,
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:07.860]   like high anxiety that woke me up at four in the morning,
[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:11.460]   you know, like, yes, there's a lot of my mind, hi.
[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:12.700]   And then there's like a boundary,
[01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:15.360]   like you're not, like you're a part of me and not all of me.
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:17.940]   So I think that phrase for regulating our own feelings,
[01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:19.900]   you're a part of me and not all of me
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:24.860]   is the essence of validating and having a boundary.
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:27.860]   - What about our need, I think healthy need
[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:31.220]   to know whether or not the lesson stuck?
[01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:33.220]   So I've observed this before,
[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:36.020]   kid is catastrophizing about an upcoming event,
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:38.900]   maybe a concert or a test or a homework thing
[01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:40.300]   or a social thing.
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:43.180]   And like, we're using all our best tools
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:44.420]   to try and help them.
[01:55:44.420 --> 01:55:46.500]   And I believe you, I hear you then.
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:49.380]   And they go through the experience and they do pretty well,
[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:50.940]   maybe even great.
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:53.000]   And then we say like, "Did you notice?
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.540]   You were so concerned before and you did it.
[01:55:56.540 --> 01:55:57.380]   You really did it."
[01:55:57.380 --> 01:55:59.540]   Is there something that we can or should do
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:02.020]   to try and stamp down that recognition?
[01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:04.900]   Because one thing that's so beautiful about childhood
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:08.180]   is the short-term horizon nature of childhood
[01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:10.920]   in which kind of like, I mean, we talk about, you know,
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.520]   adults trying to take it one day at a time
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:13.460]   or even half a day at a time.
[01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:15.740]   And kids are navigating on the basis of like
[01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:19.220]   first period class, second barrier class.
[01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:24.220]   I mean, their horizon is often very close in.
[01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:28.760]   And I do wonder if they're internalizing
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:31.980]   these more global lessons on their own
[01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:35.520]   or whether or not we should try and help them internalize
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:36.360]   what they just did.
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:37.460]   Like, do you get it?
[01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:39.340]   You were super concerned.
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:40.980]   You were like almost dissolving
[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:42.260]   into a puddle of your own tears.
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:45.340]   And I believe you, that was the appropriate response then.
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:48.060]   And now you did it, like, think about that.
[01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:53.060]   Is it good that we reinforce those wins?
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:56.460]   - Yeah, I mean, I think our kids do internalize
[01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:58.460]   kind of the patterns, right?
[01:56:58.460 --> 01:56:59.920]   But I hear you, there are these moments,
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:02.140]   it's almost like we wanna like encapsulate it for them.
[01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:03.860]   Like, hey, that was the thing, right?
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:06.660]   I think kids pick up on whether our interactions
[01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:08.940]   were doing something for them or for us.
[01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:10.940]   So if it's from a like, hey, that thing I taught you
[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:12.060]   was really helpful, right?
[01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:14.280]   Like, it would just be like, if my husband was like,
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:15.340]   hey, your presentation went well
[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:17.220]   because I like told you to do that thing.
[01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:19.640]   And I'd be like, stop talking to me, right?
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:22.020]   But if he said to me, hey, like, what was it
[01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:22.860]   that led to that?
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:24.380]   It's probably like, that's helpful to talk out.
[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:26.220]   You know, I'd be much more open.
[01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:28.980]   So I love the phrase going back to like just real tools,
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:30.020]   I'm noticing.
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:31.860]   I think actually often we wanna praise our kids
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:34.320]   or tell something, just saying I'm noticing,
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:36.540]   'cause again, we wanna be seen.
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:38.660]   We don't wanna feel controlled.
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:39.740]   I'm noticing does that.
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:42.420]   Like, hey, I'm noticing you were so worried about this test.
[01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:43.600]   We kind of talked about this way
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:45.160]   of like talking to your anxiety.
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:48.460]   And then I'm just noticing you like felt really good
[01:57:48.460 --> 01:57:49.800]   about how it went.
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:50.960]   Like even that, I think,
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:52.980]   'cause that's like the biggest thing now
[01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:55.060]   in our like crazy fast world we live in
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:56.620]   is just pausing to notice.
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:58.680]   That's already like encapsulating.
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:57:59.980]   Or saying to your kid,
[01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:03.220]   and I think like a question's only a question
[01:58:03.220 --> 01:58:04.720]   when you don't know the answer, right?
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:07.100]   Like sometimes we ask, they have question marks,
[01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:09.440]   but it's like a statement or a criticism.
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:11.540]   So if we say to our kid,
[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:15.820]   that thing I taught you was really helpful, right?
[01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:17.380]   Do you think that was helpful?
[01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:18.440]   That's not really a question.
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:19.280]   We already have an answer.
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:21.760]   But if I say, hey, like I just thought it would be good
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:22.980]   for us to talk through for a second,
[01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:26.060]   like what was it you think that like led you
[01:58:26.060 --> 01:58:28.060]   to really feel good that day in the test?
[01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:30.480]   Then like if I really don't know what my kid could say,
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:31.540]   I think they'll receive it.
[01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:32.760]   And then they might say like,
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:33.980]   oh, is that thing we talked about?
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:35.180]   I'm like, that's so great to know.
[01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:36.820]   I'm even thinking about Spanish coming up.
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:38.740]   And like I wonder, do you think that would,
[01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:41.020]   I wonder is also a great phrase for parents.
[01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:43.320]   Just wondering, I wonder if that would be helpful there.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:45.420]   Again, they just like lower defensiveness
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:48.020]   'cause there's, maybe there's like movement with wondering.
[01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:49.880]   It doesn't feel controlling.
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:52.340]   So yeah, I think there is, like those are nice moments
[01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:54.520]   if it comes from a place of like connection,
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:55.540]   not from control.
[01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:57.320]   - That makes sense.
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:00.980]   We had a guest on this podcast, Lisa Feldman Barrett,
[01:59:00.980 --> 01:59:02.860]   who's a world expert in emotions.
[01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:05.460]   And she explained that in cultures
[01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:08.960]   where there's more nuanced language for different emotions,
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:13.880]   rather than the, what I call the emojification of emotions,
[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:16.140]   there's better emotion tolerance.
[01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:20.020]   So understanding that it's not just sad, happy, depressed,
[01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:22.300]   thrilled, but there's a lot of nuance.
[01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:25.880]   It's very context dependent, can be very useful.
[01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:27.260]   Do you think there's something to be gained
[01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:32.260]   from letting kids explore the range of emotions,
[01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:36.020]   not just, you know, how do you feel good or bad?
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:37.180]   I mean, most adults need to learn
[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:38.600]   that good or bad are valuations.
[01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:40.640]   That's not actually an emotion.
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:42.420]   It's not actually an expression of how you feel,
[01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:44.300]   but that's what we do over shorthand.
[01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:48.400]   You know, do you think that,
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:50.580]   let's just say in the United States,
[01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:52.520]   but elsewhere perhaps as well,
[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:56.120]   that there's some value to teaching kids to pay attention,
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:58.360]   like what is going on inside?
[01:59:58.360 --> 01:59:59.200]   - Yeah.
[01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:01.800]   - Like what is this feeling of what I call anxiety?
[02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:04.180]   Is it excitement and anxiety?
[02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:08.480]   Like being able to better pinpoint what one is coping with,
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:11.240]   but also the positive aspects of emotion.
[02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:12.080]   - Yes.
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:15.120]   I mean, it's funny, I am the clinical psychologist.
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:16.700]   The question, how do you feel?
[02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:19.660]   I always find like very, like a lot of pressure.
[02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:20.500]   I don't know.
[02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:22.960]   Like, I think that's, I tend not to ask my kid that,
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:25.100]   but I tend also never to have asked like patients that.
[02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:28.860]   Like, so, you know, I think what we're getting at is we want,
[02:00:28.860 --> 02:00:30.200]   and I think this relates to resilience,
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:32.080]   like resilience is our ability in my mind
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:35.400]   to tolerate the widest range of emotions as possible.
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:37.760]   'Cause like as humans, we're gonna feel that whole range.
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:40.400]   So the more of them you've learned to tolerate,
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:42.560]   like the better off you'll be.
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:44.520]   And so that's what I want for my kids.
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:47.180]   I don't know if that has to explicitly come from naming,
[02:00:47.180 --> 02:00:49.240]   although I think that point is definitely true.
[02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:50.680]   The more things we can name,
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:52.640]   the more things we can understand,
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:55.280]   to me, just showing up for your kid in a way
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:58.040]   that's like with believing, maybe with boundaries,
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:02.080]   is probably the best way to help your kid
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:03.780]   tolerate the widest range of emotions.
[02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:06.300]   'Cause they learn that every emotion
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:09.580]   like can be held in connection with someone else, right?
[02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:11.800]   Versus held in aloneness and is bad.
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:15.440]   So I guess that's the way I think through it.
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:17.600]   - Maybe we could talk about adolescents
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:19.740]   and teenagers specifically.
[02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:23.420]   Teenage years are wild.
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:28.420]   I always say that the single most traumatic aging event
[02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:30.360]   and the most rapid rate of aging
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:33.460]   that we ever experience is puberty.
[02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:35.480]   I mean, just fundamentally brain circuits
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:37.720]   that were for one thing or that were dormant
[02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:43.700]   change and come alive in ways that the world forever
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:45.720]   will look different to us, feel different to us,
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:48.660]   and our self-perception changes, period.
[02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:51.220]   It's something that biologists still understand
[02:01:51.220 --> 02:01:53.740]   at the level of hormones and hypothalamic circuitry,
[02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:56.760]   but that has really not been matched
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:59.060]   to a psychological understanding and vice versa.
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:03.460]   So like nothing is quite like the music you listen to
[02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:04.300]   when you're a teenager.
[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:06.560]   It like brings you back, the memories you form,
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:09.420]   positive and negative, stamp down, boom, now and forever.
[02:02:09.420 --> 02:02:10.900]   The emotional salience can change,
[02:02:10.900 --> 02:02:14.040]   but those are wild years.
[02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:17.220]   What are some of the more critical needs
[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:22.220]   of late adolescents and teens that are actionable?
[02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:25.780]   - Yeah.
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:30.780]   - And yeah, I mean, my teen years were crazy,
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:36.660]   but even if they're less crazy, they're always crazy.
[02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:39.700]   - Yes, yes.
[02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:43.260]   So, and one of the reasons I think, at least in America,
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:46.700]   that adolescents is seen as such a huge shift,
[02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:49.100]   like my kid is out of control, they're always out,
[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:50.740]   they're like always rejecting me,
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:53.100]   I actually don't think is unrelated
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:55.280]   to the behavioral control approaches
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.340]   that are inherent in American parenting,
[02:02:57.340 --> 02:03:01.620]   'cause like you referred to, your kid becomes 14,
[02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:03.820]   and they kind of realize like, wait,
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:06.100]   I'm bigger than one of my parents.
[02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:08.500]   Like, I literally don't care
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:11.340]   about their sticker charts anymore.
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:15.540]   And we might've missed 14 years of building a relationship.
[02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:20.540]   And so what that kid's adolescence is going to look like
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:24.820]   is markedly different than if for those past 14 years,
[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:25.900]   you weren't giving in to everything.
[02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:29.220]   No, but you were leading in a sturdier, more connected way.
[02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:30.500]   So I really think this whole idea
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:33.220]   that American adolescents like reject everything,
[02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:34.840]   I actually think not all of it,
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:36.700]   a part of it is completely developmentally normal,
[02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:39.540]   but a big part of it relates to this tradition
[02:03:39.540 --> 02:03:43.020]   of behavioral control that kids cannot reject
[02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:43.940]   until they're at the age
[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:46.260]   that they kind of could survive on their own,
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:47.340]   which is adolescence.
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:49.460]   So I think that's really important.
[02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:50.860]   The things I would tell parents
[02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:52.340]   to really keep in mind that are critical,
[02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:54.060]   number one is related to that,
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:55.960]   like a teen's job is to separate
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:58.320]   and to start to form their own identity.
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:03:59.660]   And I think there's a couple of things about that
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:00.680]   parents need to know.
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:04.860]   Number one, like I don't think we prepare parents enough
[02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:08.400]   for the true sense of loss they feel
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:11.580]   when their kids are adolescents, because that's very real.
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:13.100]   Like you've just spent all these years
[02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:15.160]   and like you've driven them to every soccer
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:16.800]   and they kind of talk to you in the back seat
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:18.440]   and maybe you have family movie nights
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:22.220]   and then all of a sudden they don't want any of that.
[02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:24.500]   And it's just so important for parents to know like,
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:26.820]   I'm gonna feel sad, I'm going to feel lost
[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:29.880]   and if we don't know to expect it.
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:31.700]   We often kind of infuse that
[02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:33.820]   into a lot of anger toward our kid.
[02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:36.940]   And so I just think that's normal
[02:04:36.940 --> 02:04:37.980]   and we should talk about that more
[02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:39.820]   and parents of adolescents need to be talking about that
[02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:41.100]   with each other, of course you miss that,
[02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:42.420]   that's totally normal.
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:46.140]   Number two, related to that separation.
[02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:48.180]   If you think about identity formation,
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:50.180]   like here's a kid and us and we're kind of close
[02:04:50.180 --> 02:04:52.120]   and now we're at the stage where developmentally
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:54.300]   their job at that stage is to figure out who they are.
[02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:55.900]   They have to overcorrect.
[02:04:55.900 --> 02:04:57.400]   Like you have to kind of overcorrect
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:59.200]   in the amount of space you take
[02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:01.500]   because it's really the only way you can figure out
[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:03.280]   like wait, maybe I do wanna take parts of that,
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:04.300]   that part's okay.
[02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:07.040]   And so I think that's like a powerful image to think about.
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:09.240]   Like they are moving far away,
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:12.940]   that distance they take from you is not their final point.
[02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:16.060]   They will move closer.
[02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:19.000]   Now going back to loss, not as close as they used to be.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.380]   And that is different but that's not,
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:24.820]   this is their way of trying to figure out who they are.
[02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:26.380]   Then the last thing I'd say that kind of relates
[02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:28.500]   to that image is like even as they move away,
[02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:31.880]   I think parents massively underestimate
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:34.340]   how much they still need us there
[02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:35.880]   making efforts to connect.
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:37.220]   And I always think like the difference
[02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:40.300]   in like an explorer and a nomad
[02:05:40.300 --> 02:05:42.380]   is whether or not you have a home base.
[02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:45.700]   And like if our teens feel like nomads,
[02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:48.420]   it's not a good situation.
[02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:50.620]   They're explorers, they try a million different things
[02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:53.140]   but like they really do need us,
[02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:55.420]   they need to know that they have a home.
[02:05:55.420 --> 02:05:57.940]   And I'll never forget my private practice.
[02:05:57.940 --> 02:05:59.660]   I used to work with teens not too long ago,
[02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:01.300]   just the teens, sometimes the parents too.
[02:06:01.300 --> 02:06:03.660]   And this teen came to me and this was extreme.
[02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:07.860]   She'd been really in a bad place with her parents,
[02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:10.240]   like intense, intense conflict.
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:13.480]   And they got in this huge fight
[02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:15.640]   and she was really, really upset.
[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:16.800]   And she was describing this to me, she's like,
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:19.060]   "And then," I was like, "Get out of my room.
[02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:20.920]   "Get out, I hate you, get out."
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:23.120]   You know, and I was just like sitting there listening
[02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:26.160]   and then she like kinda pushed me out and I slammed the door
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:31.880]   and then just a couple minutes later, opened the door.
[02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:35.180]   My heart's racing, "Can you believe they weren't there?
[02:06:35.180 --> 02:06:38.160]   "Can you believe they weren't there?"
[02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:42.120]   And to me, it was just this like,
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:45.120]   and again, it's not about being a punchy bag,
[02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:50.120]   but I like under, like her seeming anger
[02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:55.640]   and her like intense pain were so close together
[02:06:55.640 --> 02:07:00.220]   in her own story that it's just over and over the same thing
[02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:01.540]   like they're gonna reject you,
[02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:03.620]   they're gonna say, "Get out of my room."
[02:07:03.620 --> 02:07:07.500]   And yes, it sucks, but they want you to slip a note
[02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:10.800]   under their door after you've taken a couple minutes
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:13.440]   that says, "That was really tough."
[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:15.660]   Her like, "Wow, that got out of control.
[02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:17.520]   "You're a good kid and I love you."
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:18.680]   And I wanna just tell parents of teens,
[02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:20.960]   "You're gonna do that, there's gonna be a pause
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:24.440]   "and then you will hear them rip up the note, you will."
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:29.440]   And like, I swear to any parent that that still resonated
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:31.620]   and your kid is again trying to figure out,
[02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:32.880]   how do I stay close with my parents
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:34.400]   and I'm figuring out my own, who I am?
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:36.380]   So like, they rip up the note because like,
[02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:39.200]   they almost like have to do it to like take in
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:41.080]   how much they're still desperate
[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.480]   for those bids for connection.
[02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:47.640]   - Sounds a lot like the dynamics of adult relationships,
[02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:51.000]   although hopefully with a little bit
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:56.040]   less dramatic accentuation.
[02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:58.280]   But you know, even if it does, I mean, it's like
[02:07:58.280 --> 02:08:03.280]   these circuits that are laid down in childhood,
[02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:07.080]   early childhood, they persist, right?
[02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:10.000]   I mean, I think if anything has become clear to me
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.980]   in understanding brain development and brain function,
[02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:14.240]   it's that, you know, we don't discard circuitry
[02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:16.400]   for attachment and go, "Oh, you know, that was for mom
[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:18.540]   "and this one was for dad and that was for the dog."
[02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:21.520]   And then the romantic relationship is different.
[02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:25.200]   We repurpose the circuits, hence all the beautiful work
[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:27.440]   on childhood attachment that's now being translated
[02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:28.400]   to adult attachment.
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:30.000]   I mean, I realize there's nuance to it,
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.660]   but you know, I was reflecting a bit on this, again,
[02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:39.660]   incredibly potent phrase or mention of explorers
[02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:42.260]   versus nomads of having a home base
[02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:45.780]   and thinking about these psychology experiments
[02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:48.980]   where children are observed in the presence
[02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:49.820]   of their caretakers.
[02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:51.660]   Sometimes the strange situation task
[02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:52.500]   where people are separate,
[02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:55.420]   kids are separated from their moms and the mom and child,
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:57.540]   typically mom, nowadays it's also been done
[02:08:57.540 --> 02:08:59.900]   with other caretakers and dads reunite,
[02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:02.800]   but one doesn't even have to know about those experiments.
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:06.580]   All you have to do is go to a park or be out in public
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:09.760]   and see a little toddler venturing away from parent.
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:12.340]   And then what do they do every once in a while?
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:13.340]   They look back.
[02:09:13.340 --> 02:09:15.140]   They're just trying to check to make sure they're there.
[02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:18.720]   Even the kids that are taking off on the tricycle like crazy
[02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:21.540]   will eventually stop and look back.
[02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:24.440]   It's like this fundamental circuit where looking back,
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:26.880]   you know, and how far they feel they can go
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:31.460]   is in direct relationship to presumably the number of times
[02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:35.480]   that they recharged and were able to see
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:39.300]   that verification that the parent was still there.
[02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:41.560]   I think this notion of explorers versus nomads
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:45.740]   and being an explorer, obviously being a good thing,
[02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:49.100]   a healthy thing within reason,
[02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:52.260]   and nomads just feeling adrift, untethered.
[02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:53.100]   - Yes.
[02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:54.540]   - You know, one of the scariest words,
[02:09:54.540 --> 02:09:57.600]   at least to me in the English language.
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:01.580]   So the note under the door.
[02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:02.420]   - Yeah.
[02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:06.400]   - It included the words, "I love you."
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:09.160]   I don't want to get too detailed here,
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:14.160]   but those words sometimes are never spoken in a home, sadly.
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:17.640]   Sometimes are spoken so often
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:19.940]   and under so many circumstances that one wonders,
[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:21.600]   like, do they lose their potency?
[02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:26.460]   But I noticed that in that note, it finished, "I love you."
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:28.820]   It's sort of like stating at the end of the day,
[02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:32.860]   no matter what you say, probably even what you do.
[02:10:32.860 --> 02:10:36.460]   I mean, I've been in the presence of parents of kids
[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:38.880]   that were criminals that did horrible things.
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:40.500]   They still love their kids.
[02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:46.420]   So reminding kids that under any and all circumstances.
[02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:48.340]   - Yeah, and again, and I think what's so critical
[02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:51.920]   'cause our brain collapses is that doesn't mean
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:53.620]   you think their behavior is okay.
[02:10:53.620 --> 02:10:55.360]   And I get the fear.
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:57.980]   I would never want to send my kid the message
[02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:01.220]   that it's okay to quote, do certain things, right?
[02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:03.540]   Like that it's okay to just scream at your parents.
[02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:04.860]   Of course it's not okay.
[02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:08.300]   It's just, I think we miss like that happened.
[02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:09.900]   Like that happened already.
[02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:12.620]   Like if I dropped my phone and it broke
[02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:15.900]   and I was trying to understand why it broke,
[02:11:15.900 --> 02:11:18.200]   trying to understand that doesn't mean it's okay
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:19.140]   that I dropped it.
[02:11:19.140 --> 02:11:20.960]   Like it just doesn't, it just dropped.
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:21.800]   Like it already happened.
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:23.220]   Now what?
[02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:25.500]   And yeah, our kids need to know,
[02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:26.900]   they need to know that they're loved.
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:29.900]   Again, there's kind of like in that message, I think,
[02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:32.460]   like I still see you're a good kid under that moment.
[02:11:32.460 --> 02:11:34.240]   And I actually think it's a powerful strategy
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:38.240]   for every parent to kind of conjure up a good kid image.
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:39.080]   Like what is it?
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:41.300]   Was that that last time we were playing this game
[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:42.180]   and it was just so fun?
[02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:44.020]   Or is it a memory of my kid when they were three?
[02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:46.060]   And like, I don't know, they did this really cute thing.
[02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:48.980]   And it kind of like really crystallizes that.
[02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:52.600]   And like even under this bad behavior,
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:54.360]   that kid's still there.
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:59.120]   And the kids who behave the worst are in the deepest pain.
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:00.160]   I mean, the adults too.
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:01.940]   And that's not to say it's okay.
[02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:03.520]   But again, we're talking about relationships
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:04.360]   we want to be in.
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:05.560]   Like if you're in a relationship with your teen
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:07.120]   that's not one and you're like, this is toxic.
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:07.960]   Like this is my kid.
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:09.240]   I'm gonna be in a relationship with them.
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:12.400]   So remembering that they're in pain.
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:13.640]   Teens are in a lot of pain.
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:15.400]   They're exploring a new world.
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:17.000]   Frankly, right now, like teens have worlds.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000]   We don't understand it.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.500]   That's so helpful for parents to approach your teen
[02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:22.460]   just as a tangible tool and say, you know what?
[02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:23.700]   There's so many things in your world
[02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:25.200]   that I don't understand.
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:28.740]   And frankly, probably I might like criticize or judge.
[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:31.240]   Like, can you take out your phone?
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:33.360]   This, you know, whatever it is, this app you're on,
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:34.200]   this video game.
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:36.640]   Like, can we just even time box this five minutes?
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:38.580]   Like, I just want to end this conversation
[02:12:38.580 --> 02:12:40.340]   saying I understand it better.
[02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:43.020]   Like, I promise you that's probably gonna do more
[02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:45.540]   for your relationship with your kid than anything else.
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:46.380]   Because yes, they do.
[02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:47.580]   And they might reject you.
[02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:49.740]   And if you do, again, don't take the bait,
[02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:51.300]   but ask again next week.
[02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:54.860]   Like, again, they do, they need us to return.
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:55.740]   - Yeah, one thing's for sure.
[02:12:55.740 --> 02:12:58.060]   None of us, except those that are teens,
[02:12:58.060 --> 02:13:01.100]   know what it's like to be a teenager in 2024.
[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:02.660]   Just like they didn't know what it was like
[02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:05.940]   to be a teenager for me in the late 80s, early 90s.
[02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:07.360]   How could they, right?
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:12.360]   So what are your thoughts on like family meetings?
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:14.800]   Like once a week, we sit down, we check in.
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:17.180]   You know, I hear that people do this.
[02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:18.940]   Maybe participated in these before.
[02:13:18.940 --> 02:13:21.460]   Do you feel like those can be useful
[02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:24.520]   or is it more window dressing?
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:26.700]   - I mean, I guess it depends what's happening in there.
[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:27.960]   I mean, the idea of like,
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:29.400]   hey, there's a lot going on in our life
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:31.420]   and we have a ritual of coming together
[02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:33.940]   and talking things through, working through problems.
[02:13:33.940 --> 02:13:35.700]   Like if that's what it is, that's a beautiful thing.
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:36.540]   Like I hear that.
[02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:38.980]   My first thought is I should do that, you know?
[02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:39.820]   But you're right.
[02:13:39.820 --> 02:13:40.660]   Like life gets messy.
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:43.020]   So, but if it's done in a way where it feels,
[02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:45.780]   we end and everyone feels a little bit more understood
[02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:48.220]   and a little bit more purpose and, you know,
[02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:50.440]   making things move forward in a positive direction,
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:51.340]   that's amazing.
[02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:52.220]   I think family meetings,
[02:13:52.220 --> 02:13:53.940]   it's funny the way I think about them often,
[02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:57.300]   which is just different, is it's actually a great strategy,
[02:13:57.300 --> 02:13:59.160]   especially when your kids are older
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:02.300]   and there's like somewhat of an ongoing conflict.
[02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:03.780]   So maybe there's like an ongoing conflict
[02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:06.060]   about how much video game time or, you know,
[02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:08.740]   how much, you know, how late they can stay out.
[02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:10.460]   And to say to a kid, and again,
[02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:12.880]   this just comes from, again, so important for teens.
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:15.540]   We have to approach our kid like we're on the same team.
[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:18.260]   I always say, me and my kid against a problem,
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:21.260]   not me against my kid where they are the problem.
[02:14:21.260 --> 02:14:23.820]   Like, and so to say, hey, you've been late, you know,
[02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:25.940]   or we have to figure out your curfew and like,
[02:14:25.940 --> 02:14:29.060]   look, you're a smart kid, you're a good kid.
[02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:32.860]   My number one job is to keep you safe, but you're old now.
[02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:34.540]   And if I just tell you a time,
[02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:36.060]   it's the same thing that happened last year,
[02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:38.180]   where you get in fights all year, why don't we sit down?
[02:14:38.180 --> 02:14:39.580]   And we will do what I do in my office.
[02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:41.420]   There's two people that each have ideas.
[02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:42.460]   I'm gonna bring a pad of paper
[02:14:42.460 --> 02:14:44.220]   and that's actually super important.
[02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:46.820]   And I'm gonna write down all of your ideas and my ideas.
[02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:47.820]   And then we're just gonna kind of go through
[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:50.180]   and cross out the ones that feel completely unreasonable.
[02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:52.020]   And I have a feeling when we do that,
[02:14:52.020 --> 02:14:53.420]   we're gonna come to a good place.
[02:14:53.420 --> 02:14:55.540]   So again, you can see there's that like hope I'm giving,
[02:14:55.540 --> 02:14:58.260]   like I hold the positive outcome, the same team.
[02:14:58.260 --> 02:15:00.740]   I'm giving my kid credit in advance.
[02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:01.780]   This is actually like really,
[02:15:01.780 --> 02:15:03.460]   it's usually the opposite of what teens feel,
[02:15:03.460 --> 02:15:05.540]   which is just my parents don't even listen to me or care
[02:15:05.540 --> 02:15:07.220]   and think they have all the answers.
[02:15:07.220 --> 02:15:09.060]   - I've heard this notion of, you know,
[02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:13.860]   couple parents come first and kids come second.
[02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:15.660]   And some people are probably like, what?
[02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:17.740]   You know, well, clearly never parented.
[02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:21.800]   Oh, well, no, actually it's an interesting idea,
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:24.100]   perhaps not correct or incorrect,
[02:15:24.100 --> 02:15:28.680]   but maybe dynamic across time where the real question is
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:31.580]   if kids know that they are running the family
[02:15:31.580 --> 02:15:34.460]   in terms of what they do or their inability
[02:15:34.460 --> 02:15:36.960]   to not be attended to, et cetera,
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:41.900]   is driving the whole relationship that the parents are in
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:45.280]   versus, you know, recognizing,
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:46.900]   and here I'm imagining two-parent home,
[02:15:46.900 --> 02:15:48.860]   but we can talk about divorced
[02:15:48.860 --> 02:15:51.700]   or people with significant others or single-parent homes.
[02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:58.380]   In all of those, you kind of wonder like,
[02:15:58.380 --> 02:16:00.300]   are kids really paying attention
[02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:03.640]   to how much they are being prioritized to the point where
[02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:05.860]   if they observe their parents tending to their own needs
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:09.760]   that they feel deprivation or is it make them feel safer?
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:14.680]   Like, hey, mom and/or dad are taking care of themselves
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:16.240]   and can show up better.
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:19.140]   - Yes, I think that is critically important.
[02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:22.040]   And it kind of goes again to boundaries like of a parent.
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:25.120]   Like my relationship with my kid is so important
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:28.360]   and I'm not going to let that take over me.
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:29.760]   Like that is not all of me.
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:32.840]   I am not only a caregiver to my kid.
[02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:34.920]   Like I would stand by that all day long.
[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:36.240]   Like, is that an important part of me?
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:37.760]   And it's still a part of me.
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:40.520]   And I think this is really important to own as a parent.
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:43.880]   'Cause again, we tend to get, like we get apologists for it
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:45.280]   or we look for our kids' permission.
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:48.400]   We'll say, look, I need to go out with dad without you.
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:51.000]   Okay, like we have a relationship too.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.620]   Like, and we, again, there's that job confusion
[02:16:53.620 --> 02:16:54.880]   and my kid feels that.
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:57.360]   And again, it's that kind of giving them too much power.
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:58.720]   I've said this to my kids a lot.
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:00.680]   So I'll say, why do you go out with dad without me?
[02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:02.280]   I'll say, it's a great question.
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:03.180]   You know, first of all,
[02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:05.760]   dad and I were married before we had kids.
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:08.720]   Our relationship is really important to us.
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:10.160]   And we love being with you.
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:12.240]   And being with you is different
[02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:14.320]   than just being the two of us.
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:16.640]   And that really, really matters to us.
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:18.320]   And so you don't have to be happy about it.
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:20.400]   You can, you, and let's say I have a babysitter
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:21.640]   I know they're safe with.
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:24.520]   You can cry when I leave and the babysitter will hold you
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:26.040]   and we're gonna go out to dinner
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:28.520]   and we're gonna come back and, you know,
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:29.480]   I'll see you in the morning.
[02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:31.720]   Yeah, I think that is so important.
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:33.240]   I actually think this is another topic.
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:36.720]   Like this topic of like rage in parenthood
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:37.700]   is like a big topic.
[02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:42.700]   Like the way, why do I get to these moments of rage so often
[02:17:42.700 --> 02:17:44.760]   that my screaming is not just screaming at my kids.
[02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:45.780]   It's really rageful.
[02:17:45.780 --> 02:17:47.480]   And I think the parents often
[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:49.180]   who are the most vulnerable to that
[02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:54.360]   are the ones where they're not meeting
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:57.680]   like any of their non-caregiving needs,
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:00.320]   which makes sense that a part of them is like screaming out.
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:01.160]   Like, what about me?
[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:02.140]   I used to go to dance class.
[02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:03.320]   I used to see friends.
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:05.000]   I used to go out with my partner
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.240]   and talk about things other than, you know, our kids.
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:12.240]   And so, again, I think a kids need a sturdy leader, right?
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:13.160]   More than anything else.
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:15.740]   And sturdiness is not allowing yourself
[02:18:15.740 --> 02:18:17.520]   to be taken over by any one thing,
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:19.720]   including your relationship with your kid.
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:22.000]   - Is it truly better for there to be two sturdy leaders
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.920]   than one sturdy leader?
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:25.600]   I realize this is a controversial question.
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:27.840]   - Yeah, I mean, I know,
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:29.640]   and I know there's research to back this up
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:32.500]   that like having one kind of sturdy leader in your life
[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:34.640]   is massively protective.
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:35.740]   I really believe that.
[02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:37.980]   And so when parents will say my partner isn't,
[02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:40.820]   I'm like, we have research, this is true.
[02:18:40.820 --> 02:18:42.020]   Is two better than one?
[02:18:42.020 --> 02:18:43.380]   I don't know the research.
[02:18:43.380 --> 02:18:45.320]   Probably, I don't know, you know?
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:47.820]   But what I think is important in there too
[02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:50.420]   is what's not great for kids
[02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:52.540]   is having like all the caregivers
[02:18:52.540 --> 02:18:55.780]   be some like perfectly attuned caregiver, right?
[02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:59.180]   Like that actually does not set up your kid for life
[02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:00.500]   at all, right?
[02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:01.880]   Because I don't know anyone who thinks
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:03.200]   the partner I'm gonna be with one day
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:05.660]   is gonna be perfectly attuned to all my needs.
[02:19:05.660 --> 02:19:07.220]   Let me go find that person.
[02:19:07.220 --> 02:19:10.740]   So, you know, you have one sturdy leader, you have two,
[02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:13.700]   but like being sturdy, part of that is you're gonna rupture.
[02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:15.360]   You're gonna rupture, you're gonna mess up,
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:18.960]   you're gonna hopefully repair, you know, after.
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:20.080]   But sturdiness, I just wanna make clear,
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:22.120]   is so not the same as like perfection.
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:24.420]   Perfection is creepy, it's not a thing.
[02:19:24.420 --> 02:19:25.260]   No one needs that.
[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:26.380]   (laughing)
[02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:27.220]   - I love that.
[02:19:28.140 --> 02:19:30.780]   So for some, I've laughed out loud on this podcast
[02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:32.180]   about a statement like that.
[02:19:32.180 --> 02:19:36.340]   Yeah, the notion of perfection is kind of creepy.
[02:19:36.340 --> 02:19:39.740]   But sturdiness is anything but creepy.
[02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:43.140]   It's just such a beautiful word for all the right reasons.
[02:19:43.140 --> 02:19:45.280]   What about behavioral examples in parents?
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:50.280]   So for instance, if children observe parents
[02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:53.980]   being affectionate to one another in appropriate ways,
[02:19:53.980 --> 02:19:58.860]   right, you know, attending to one another in boundary,
[02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:00.600]   but empathically attuned ways,
[02:20:00.600 --> 02:20:05.740]   do you think that projects forward into their notion
[02:20:05.740 --> 02:20:09.100]   of what adult relationships are like and should be like?
[02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:11.960]   Conversely, if parents are yelling at one another,
[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:14.540]   do you think that projects forward into,
[02:20:14.540 --> 02:20:17.620]   it's okay to yell in adult relationships?
[02:20:17.620 --> 02:20:22.100]   - Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think kids are expert noticers.
[02:20:22.100 --> 02:20:23.140]   They notice everything, right,
[02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:24.580]   is part of how they've learned to survive
[02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:26.500]   as such helpless humans.
[02:20:26.500 --> 02:20:30.200]   So they definitely notice, they definitely act like sponges.
[02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:35.100]   So yes, if you're kind of privileged enough in that way
[02:20:35.100 --> 02:20:37.380]   to grow up in a home or you have parents who, in general,
[02:20:37.380 --> 02:20:38.700]   are fairly affectionate,
[02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:40.820]   they take responsibility for their stuff,
[02:20:40.820 --> 02:20:42.740]   they communicate in a healthy way,
[02:20:42.740 --> 02:20:44.720]   I think that is like a true privilege
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:46.840]   you go into adulthood with, yes.
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:51.700]   The other extreme, right, you grow up with parents who,
[02:20:51.700 --> 02:20:55.380]   you know, they yell or they can even yell in scary voices.
[02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:57.000]   Again, what I think is really important
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:00.060]   is the witnessing of that
[02:21:00.060 --> 02:21:03.340]   isn't going to be as impactful to a kid
[02:21:03.340 --> 02:21:06.820]   as the witnessing of it and nobody naming it
[02:21:06.820 --> 02:21:08.740]   and talking to them about it.
[02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:11.540]   So this is why so often kids will be in difficult stages,
[02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:13.780]   intense tantrums, major issues at school,
[02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:15.220]   and someone's like, what do I do?
[02:21:15.220 --> 02:21:16.220]   Like, what do I do with this?
[02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:18.940]   Well, I gave you all the strategies in the world,
[02:21:18.940 --> 02:21:22.340]   but if that is just your kid's way of kind of manifesting
[02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:24.020]   all of their struggles with this like
[02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:26.620]   huge marital conflict that's happening,
[02:21:26.620 --> 02:21:27.880]   it's not gonna work.
[02:21:27.880 --> 02:21:29.860]   So it's all part of the same system.
[02:21:29.860 --> 02:21:32.740]   And so saying to your kid after you fight with your partner,
[02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:34.860]   hey, I think you heard daddy and I screaming,
[02:21:34.860 --> 02:21:36.460]   and I'm sure that felt scary,
[02:21:36.460 --> 02:21:37.500]   'cause it does feel scary
[02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:39.420]   because they know you're their base.
[02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:40.820]   So if their base is of a house,
[02:21:40.820 --> 02:21:42.860]   it's like, you know, feels like an earthquake,
[02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:43.920]   it feels scary.
[02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:47.400]   And, you know, another line I like is like,
[02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:48.960]   you were right to notice that.
[02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:50.560]   We were using loud voices.
[02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:53.360]   Again, I think that's massively confidence building.
[02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:55.720]   Maybe what was that like for you?
[02:21:55.720 --> 02:21:57.200]   Or if you have a little kid, just that's enough.
[02:21:57.200 --> 02:21:58.640]   You know, and they might look at you and say like,
[02:21:58.640 --> 02:21:59.800]   can I have my snack now?
[02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:01.580]   But it's still really sunk in.
[02:22:01.580 --> 02:22:03.800]   So if there is a lot of conflict, again,
[02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:04.880]   I think it's really important
[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:07.160]   we talk about that with our kids.
[02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:08.860]   Don't leave them alone.
[02:22:08.860 --> 02:22:11.400]   - What about teens that are really wayward?
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:14.440]   And this could be behavioral outbursts.
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:17.060]   There's also the whole underside of this thing
[02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:18.940]   where it's also about withdrawal.
[02:22:18.940 --> 02:22:20.000]   Like the kids are withdrawn.
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.800]   I mean, we were talking about outbursts and yelling.
[02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:23.540]   There's also the example in parents
[02:22:23.540 --> 02:22:25.960]   or the instances in kids that they're just like
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:26.960]   really withdrawn.
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:27.800]   - Yes.
[02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:30.540]   - They're just like disengaged.
[02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:31.380]   - Depressed.
[02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:35.320]   - Depressed, maybe even dissociative, who knows,
[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:36.600]   but not good.
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:38.960]   And this can show up on one end as violence,
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:40.700]   on the other end as isolation.
[02:22:40.700 --> 02:22:42.240]   It can show up as eating disorders.
[02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:44.660]   It can show up as all sorts of things.
[02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:49.560]   You know, intervention before age 18
[02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:54.240]   is "easier" in the sense that one has legal control,
[02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:56.740]   but oftentimes it's hard for parents to know
[02:22:56.740 --> 02:22:58.520]   like how bad is this?
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:00.800]   And, you know, I did an entire episode about cannabis
[02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:03.360]   and I spoke to some of the medical benefits of cannabis
[02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:04.860]   for adults who are non addicts,
[02:23:04.860 --> 02:23:06.680]   but I also talked a lot about some of the risks,
[02:23:06.680 --> 02:23:09.060]   but let's take an example that I think is pretty common.
[02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:13.600]   Like kids 15, 16 starts smoking some THC with their friends
[02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:15.040]   and you go, okay, well, everyone does that.
[02:23:15.040 --> 02:23:16.560]   Quote unquote, not as bad as alcohol,
[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:18.400]   which I think is a lame argument.
[02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:19.520]   This is lame.
[02:23:19.520 --> 02:23:20.360]   It doesn't make any sense.
[02:23:20.360 --> 02:23:21.900]   Again, you're getting hit by a, you know,
[02:23:21.900 --> 02:23:24.520]   cars isn't bad as getting hit by a train, but okay.
[02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:31.000]   But the point is, you know, most all parents are like,
[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:35.400]   okay, you know, clearly they're self-medicating, you know,
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:37.240]   can't, they think they can't stop them,
[02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:38.240]   but you can stop them.
[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:41.360]   You know, at what point do you then take, you know,
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:43.200]   you put them into a residential treatment program
[02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:44.280]   if you could even afford that?
[02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:47.100]   I mean, it's really tough for people to know
[02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:51.120]   how much to intervene in what is clearly not good behavior
[02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:52.740]   and it sometimes can be bad behavior.
[02:23:52.740 --> 02:23:54.880]   And yet the kids are using it to self-medicate
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:23:58.240]   and there's a peer system that sometimes reinforces that.
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:00.280]   I mean, this is a huge landscape.
[02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:02.200]   Maybe we have you back to talk just about this,
[02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:05.600]   but maybe we can press it to that discussion,
[02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:10.600]   but by like, what do you tell people in your practice?
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:15.440]   Like, get in there now, pull the emergency cord
[02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:17.680]   and get this handled, or do you say, listen,
[02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:19.920]   you just got to work with the, you know,
[02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:22.000]   work with the system and it's a tough problem
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:22.840]   I'm throwing at you here, but-
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:24.820]   - Yeah, I think the first thing is like,
[02:24:24.820 --> 02:24:27.540]   how do I as a parent, like kind of even assess,
[02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:28.960]   it's like, is this normal?
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:29.780]   Is it not normal?
[02:24:29.780 --> 02:24:30.620]   Is it a problem?
[02:24:30.620 --> 02:24:31.460]   Is it not?
[02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:32.280]   So I think there's a couple of like things
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:33.180]   we could think about there.
[02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:36.200]   Number one, just seeing like impact on overall functioning
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:39.100]   is always like one barometer, right?
[02:24:39.100 --> 02:24:43.620]   So, okay, can my child perform the kind of tasks
[02:24:43.620 --> 02:24:45.280]   of their developmental stage?
[02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:46.740]   Okay, so this is not the only thing,
[02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:48.360]   but like, are they still going to school?
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:50.720]   Wow, I noticed since they're smoking a lot of weeds,
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:52.820]   their grades went from Bs to Ds.
[02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:55.140]   Like, okay, they don't care about school anymore.
[02:24:55.140 --> 02:24:56.780]   They used to actually go out with friends.
[02:24:56.780 --> 02:24:58.300]   Now, unless they're with this one crew
[02:24:58.300 --> 02:24:59.820]   where they smoke in the park,
[02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:01.560]   like they're not even seeing these kids
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:02.720]   they used to be friends with.
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:04.740]   They don't want to go to family functions anymore.
[02:25:04.740 --> 02:25:05.780]   They used to play soccer.
[02:25:05.780 --> 02:25:07.860]   Like if I'm answering this, I'd be like, wow,
[02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:11.100]   I'm not really talking just about a marijuana problem.
[02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:12.940]   I'm talking about my kid not engaging
[02:25:12.940 --> 02:25:14.980]   in kind of like the developmental tasks.
[02:25:14.980 --> 02:25:17.220]   That I would say is just like,
[02:25:17.220 --> 02:25:20.560]   it's time to seek additional support, right?
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:24.860]   Another sign is just kind of how limited their world
[02:25:24.860 --> 02:25:27.160]   has become because of this, right?
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:31.040]   So again, is this kind of taken over everything they do?
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:34.060]   My kid is depressed, let's say, or, you know,
[02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:36.340]   and all of a sudden their world has gotten
[02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:38.820]   really, really small and it's not just that,
[02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:40.100]   that's the way they've always lived.
[02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:42.120]   Like there's a big change.
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:43.600]   The amount of conflict in the home.
[02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:45.700]   Again, like is there conflict when you have teens?
[02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:47.720]   Of course there is, but like, wow,
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:49.180]   like is it really hard to talk to my teen
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:50.580]   for more than four minutes?
[02:25:50.580 --> 02:25:53.600]   Walking on eggshells to me is also a sign
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:54.660]   that we need additional help.
[02:25:54.660 --> 02:25:56.540]   Am I scared to intervene in a way
[02:25:56.540 --> 02:25:59.220]   that would actually be in line with my values?
[02:25:59.220 --> 02:26:01.300]   That's not a good sign, right?
[02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:03.540]   Then the other thing I just want to make sure everyone knows
[02:26:03.540 --> 02:26:05.820]   is I mean, like seeking additional help
[02:26:05.820 --> 02:26:08.380]   is a sign of every single thing that's right with the family
[02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:10.580]   and I think we think it's a sign of something that's wrong
[02:26:10.580 --> 02:26:12.780]   and it's like also a sign of what's right to your,
[02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:14.880]   in terms of messaging that to your kid.
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:18.220]   Again, I think about a kid who I used to see in my practice.
[02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:19.540]   She was probably 16 when she came to me.
[02:26:19.540 --> 02:26:22.460]   She was cutting, serious, right?
[02:26:22.460 --> 02:26:23.700]   And I remember saying just intake,
[02:26:23.700 --> 02:26:25.140]   hey, how long have you been doing this?
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:26.500]   She was two years.
[02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:29.380]   Oh, like did you see another therapist before you saw me?
[02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:30.220]   She was like, no.
[02:26:30.220 --> 02:26:32.020]   She was like very like kind of, you know,
[02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:35.480]   kind of quippy and quick and I was just like,
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:36.320]   why?
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:38.720]   And she's like, well, I told my parents
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:40.260]   that if they took me to a therapist,
[02:26:40.260 --> 02:26:42.300]   I would go and I would just waste all their money.
[02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:44.140]   I'd be quiet and then when they left me there,
[02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:46.520]   I would just leave and who's gonna stop a 14 year old
[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:48.860]   from walking away and they might as well save their money
[02:26:48.860 --> 02:26:50.940]   because they can't meet me, okay?
[02:26:50.940 --> 02:26:54.260]   And again, I just kind of sensed to stay quiet
[02:26:54.260 --> 02:26:56.740]   and she's seriously, one of the next things she said is,
[02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:59.540]   can you believe they let me make that decision?
[02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:01.020]   Literally said that.
[02:27:01.020 --> 02:27:03.180]   - Wow, validates everything you've said up until now.
[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:04.600]   - And it is, this is why, this is where like,
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:06.040]   I feel like I get my best ideas.
[02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:09.140]   Like that's right, like a 14 year old can convince
[02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:14.140]   her parent that she won't go to therapy when she's cutting.
[02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:17.020]   Like that is not okay and again, then we go to,
[02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:19.400]   okay, so I'm gonna say to my kid, you are going.
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:20.980]   I'm like, no, there's so much between that.
[02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:22.720]   We're in these binary states.
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:24.660]   Your kid's feelings about therapy
[02:27:24.660 --> 02:27:27.440]   cannot dictate your boundary, right?
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:29.900]   But we can't just then come down harshly
[02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:31.620]   and so I coach parents in this all the time.
[02:27:31.620 --> 02:27:32.860]   What do you say to a kid?
[02:27:32.860 --> 02:27:34.100]   I love you.
[02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:37.320]   Hear me, I love you.
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:39.100]   We're in a tough stage.
[02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:41.980]   I see this problem and I do think even when our kids
[02:27:41.980 --> 02:27:43.380]   get older, we can say this.
[02:27:43.380 --> 02:27:47.380]   My number one job is to keep you safe.
[02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:49.500]   It is not to keep you happy with me
[02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:51.780]   and I actually love you so much that I'm willing
[02:27:51.780 --> 02:27:55.280]   to do things that make you unhappy with me.
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:58.600]   That is actually how much I care about you
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:00.880]   and so I am gonna be driving you
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:04.380]   and if you wanna like curse at me the whole time,
[02:28:04.380 --> 02:28:06.480]   I will sit in that waiting room
[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:07.840]   and you know what I'm gonna do the next week?
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:09.200]   I'm gonna tell you I love you.
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:10.600]   I'm gonna do the same thing
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:13.960]   and I think adults hearing that on some level,
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:15.240]   there's some internal truth.
[02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:17.120]   I'm like, I probably needed that.
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:19.760]   Like that feels oddly good
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:22.680]   because there's like, you know I'm not messing around
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:24.560]   but there's this way where as parents,
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:25.700]   we've said like the way to show my kid
[02:28:25.700 --> 02:28:27.880]   I'm not messing around is to be mean to them.
[02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:29.820]   Like there was nothing mean about what I said.
[02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:32.600]   I think it was more loving than saying to a kid,
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:34.640]   okay, let me know when you wanna go.
[02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:36.320]   That is not loving.
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:39.480]   And so I think like our teens sometimes in those moments,
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:42.240]   they need us to do our job and like be the pilot.
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:43.980]   Like it is the small amount of time
[02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:45.140]   where they're still a passenger.
[02:28:45.140 --> 02:28:47.940]   When they're 18, they are the pilot
[02:28:47.940 --> 02:28:50.160]   and so we have this window.
[02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:52.400]   - There's nothing I wanna probe more into that.
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:54.800]   I think you captured it beautifully
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:57.120]   and it gets back to this issue of safety.
[02:28:57.120 --> 02:28:58.960]   Like in letting them make their own decision
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:00.080]   when they're clearly in trouble,
[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:03.800]   like if anything could make a kid feel unsafe,
[02:29:03.800 --> 02:29:06.860]   a teen or younger or adult, it's that.
[02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:08.620]   - Yes, yes.
[02:29:08.620 --> 02:29:10.440]   - It's like laying the passenger on the plane.
[02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:12.280]   Be like, hey, instead of rerouting,
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:14.240]   how about you just come up here and fly?
[02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:16.320]   - That's exactly, that's literally what it is.
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:18.260]   And they're like, I can't believe you believed
[02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:20.360]   my little protest now I'm in the cockpit.
[02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:22.680]   Like they don't want that.
[02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:25.000]   That's why their words, teens' words,
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:26.680]   it's not that we don't believe them.
[02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:28.380]   Like as you see, I'm big on believing.
[02:29:28.380 --> 02:29:33.040]   Their words often are a representation of their fears,
[02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:34.760]   all of us in our worst moments.
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:35.680]   Get out.
[02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:38.260]   Like I feel like sometimes like that's their fear
[02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:40.560]   or like they're kind of talking to their emotion.
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:42.080]   They're so like, they're not really talking to you
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:43.640]   in that moment, they're so dysregulated
[02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:46.700]   and like just learning to like not take it so literally
[02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:48.260]   and be like, what am I really believing?
[02:29:48.260 --> 02:29:49.600]   My kid is in pain, they're cutting.
[02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:52.580]   My kid is in pain, they're smoking weed 30 times a day
[02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:53.400]   and don't go to class.
[02:29:53.400 --> 02:29:57.400]   Like I know that they need help.
[02:29:57.400 --> 02:29:58.940]   And again, any parent who can say that,
[02:29:58.940 --> 02:30:01.620]   like to me is like the strongest parent
[02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:03.920]   and that is such a sign of health.
[02:30:03.920 --> 02:30:06.520]   - I don't think I'd still be alive today
[02:30:06.520 --> 02:30:09.520]   if it wasn't for non-parent mentors
[02:30:09.520 --> 02:30:11.400]   and it just examples in the world.
[02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:12.960]   These aren't always people that were like,
[02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:14.220]   hey, I'm going to take you under my wing
[02:30:14.220 --> 02:30:15.060]   and be your mentor.
[02:30:15.060 --> 02:30:16.440]   Actually, that was rarely the case.
[02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:21.440]   But people in my real life or in my, you know, reading
[02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:24.280]   or, you know, there wasn't YouTube back then.
[02:30:24.280 --> 02:30:27.840]   But sometimes now, you know, people have, I'm a huge fan,
[02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:30.860]   for instance, of these Jungian psychologist, James Hollis,
[02:30:30.860 --> 02:30:33.640]   who has these beautiful lectures on making a life.
[02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:37.600]   And I'm learning so much, like I consider him a mentor.
[02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:39.520]   Sorry, James, you didn't have a choice.
[02:30:39.520 --> 02:30:40.360]   You're a mentor.
[02:30:40.360 --> 02:30:41.960]   But these people that we can internalize
[02:30:41.960 --> 02:30:46.640]   certain healthy aspects that our parents just apparently
[02:30:46.640 --> 02:30:49.560]   can't seem to arrange for themselves
[02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:51.040]   and that we wish they had.
[02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:54.760]   But I think that we, as children of all ages,
[02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:58.040]   like we want perfect parents.
[02:30:58.040 --> 02:30:59.040]   We don't get them.
[02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:02.800]   But it seems appropriate to me.
[02:31:02.800 --> 02:31:03.640]   I'd love your thoughts.
[02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:05.880]   It seems appropriate to me to have, you know,
[02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:08.720]   kind of a foraging for examples of where
[02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:11.100]   we can get certain things that we can internalize
[02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:13.240]   for ourselves so that we can benefit
[02:31:13.240 --> 02:31:16.000]   that maybe our parents just aren't interested in,
[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.520]   capable of, or even alive to provide us anymore.
[02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:19.440]   - Yeah.
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:21.920]   Yeah, I mean that like being everything to someone,
[02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:26.440]   like, I don't want my kids to ever say that about me.
[02:31:26.440 --> 02:31:27.760]   My mom was everything.
[02:31:27.760 --> 02:31:29.640]   She fulfilled my every need again.
[02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:32.000]   I do find that creepy whenever, I don't know.
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:35.000]   And like, and just setting them up
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:38.320]   for so much relationship disappointment.
[02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:43.140]   My mom gave some things and, you know,
[02:31:43.140 --> 02:31:44.860]   now that I also work a lot of funny with my kids,
[02:31:44.860 --> 02:31:46.800]   like, there is this mom,
[02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:48.880]   like when kids have a sleepover at her house,
[02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:51.680]   I mean, it is the best sleepover experience.
[02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:53.040]   Like I see pictures and I'm like,
[02:31:53.040 --> 02:31:54.080]   wow, that was so thoughtful.
[02:31:54.080 --> 02:31:54.920]   That was amazing.
[02:31:54.920 --> 02:31:57.120]   She's like, she puts it, she's creative.
[02:31:57.120 --> 02:31:58.880]   Like, and me and my kids joke.
[02:31:58.880 --> 02:32:00.400]   Like, they're like, yeah, mom,
[02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:02.180]   you're like bottom of the list and that stuff.
[02:32:02.180 --> 02:32:04.760]   And I am, I am.
[02:32:04.760 --> 02:32:07.120]   And like, I know I'm toward the top of the list
[02:32:07.120 --> 02:32:07.960]   and other things.
[02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:09.100]   I don't want to be toward them.
[02:32:09.100 --> 02:32:10.740]   First of all, I don't want to hold myself to that standard.
[02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:12.420]   That's like a great way to implode.
[02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:14.460]   So yeah, being able to say to my kid,
[02:32:14.460 --> 02:32:15.460]   oh, you guys want to have a sleepover?
[02:32:15.460 --> 02:32:16.680]   You'd rather go to her house?
[02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:20.200]   'Cause that's okay, like that's not an indictment of me.
[02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:22.640]   And so maybe this is some quote mentor-like figure
[02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:24.540]   for someone who can like put these details
[02:32:24.540 --> 02:32:26.880]   and make people feel really taken care of in that way.
[02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:27.920]   That's great.
[02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:30.720]   And I think, yes, giving your kid permission
[02:32:30.720 --> 02:32:32.160]   and encouragement, again,
[02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:33.740]   I think is such a gift to them later on.
[02:32:33.740 --> 02:32:36.640]   Like, yeah, our relationship with our kids
[02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:38.600]   becomes not only the foundation,
[02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:41.040]   their expectations for their relationship
[02:32:41.040 --> 02:32:41.860]   with other adults.
[02:32:41.860 --> 02:32:45.040]   I also think it's literally what they're attracted to.
[02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:46.660]   I think when they're attracted to someone later on,
[02:32:46.660 --> 02:32:50.300]   it's just the activation of that like earliest attachment.
[02:32:50.300 --> 02:32:53.160]   And so if they can get activated around someone
[02:32:53.160 --> 02:32:55.680]   who seems to be pretty attuned and respectful
[02:32:55.680 --> 02:32:58.160]   and validating and boundary,
[02:32:58.160 --> 02:33:00.120]   because they also have other things in their life
[02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:02.500]   and not everything, like that's a privilege to say,
[02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:03.960]   that's what I'm expecting.
[02:33:03.960 --> 02:33:05.640]   So I think those other relationships,
[02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:07.340]   and as a parent to hear your kids say,
[02:33:07.340 --> 02:33:08.780]   my coach taught me this thing.
[02:33:08.780 --> 02:33:11.340]   And sometimes they say it in a catty way,
[02:33:11.340 --> 02:33:15.060]   so much better than what you said to do at lacrosse.
[02:33:15.060 --> 02:33:16.280]   Just to like take a deep breath.
[02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:18.960]   And again, this is where you can say like,
[02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:21.520]   I'm still a good parent, even outside this moment.
[02:33:21.520 --> 02:33:25.360]   I'm so glad you're talking to me about this.
[02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:27.000]   I believe you, tell me more about this.
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:30.080]   Like such a beautiful example for your kid.
[02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:33.080]   - So being able to validate and embrace the fact
[02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:36.120]   that there are other sources of healthy upbringing
[02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:40.860]   is not just perhaps is clearly a good thing.
[02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:41.700]   Do I have that right?
[02:33:41.700 --> 02:33:42.520]   - I think that's right.
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:43.820]   And I think if that's hard for a parent,
[02:33:43.820 --> 02:33:46.340]   what I'd say is like, it's a question without an exact
[02:33:46.340 --> 02:33:48.700]   answer, but like, where did I learn that I'm supposed
[02:33:48.700 --> 02:33:51.580]   to be everything to someone?
[02:33:51.580 --> 02:33:55.260]   Like, and is that, and I think a lot of women,
[02:33:55.260 --> 02:33:59.860]   we learn that in our families of origin to be good girls,
[02:33:59.860 --> 02:34:03.460]   which really just means I have no wants and needs my own.
[02:34:03.460 --> 02:34:06.260]   And I just kind of gaze out and see how I can do things
[02:34:06.260 --> 02:34:08.780]   for you and I can be everything for you.
[02:34:08.780 --> 02:34:10.420]   And then we have kids, we don't realize we put that
[02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:14.260]   onto them, but like you said, those patterns travel with us.
[02:34:14.260 --> 02:34:16.900]   And I find it like very relieving to be like,
[02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:19.940]   maybe if I don't, wow, it just gave me like a good percentage
[02:34:19.940 --> 02:34:20.780]   of energy back.
[02:34:20.780 --> 02:34:23.660]   Like I can do like so many other things now, you know?
[02:34:23.660 --> 02:34:25.980]   It's very, it's like empowering.
[02:34:25.980 --> 02:34:26.800]   - I love it.
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:32.260]   Something that it's an unpleasant topic just by,
[02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:33.420]   as soon as people hear the word,
[02:34:33.420 --> 02:34:37.540]   but it's something that I think it comes up on the child
[02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:39.900]   side, the teen side and the parenting side.
[02:34:39.900 --> 02:34:41.840]   And in adult relationships of all kind,
[02:34:41.840 --> 02:34:45.460]   which is the dreaded entitlement.
[02:34:45.460 --> 02:34:46.620]   - Dirty word of parenting.
[02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:47.800]   - Entitlement.
[02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:51.140]   Maybe we could put some definition on entitlement
[02:34:51.140 --> 02:34:55.020]   and talk about when it's bad, is it always bad?
[02:34:55.020 --> 02:34:57.700]   When it's neutral and when it's, I don't know,
[02:34:57.700 --> 02:34:58.540]   is it ever good?
[02:34:58.540 --> 02:35:01.260]   I don't know, entitlement doesn't sound like it's ever good.
[02:35:01.260 --> 02:35:05.620]   - Yeah, there is a healthy entitlement, right?
[02:35:05.620 --> 02:35:07.900]   And I think that is kind of the entitlement to like,
[02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:10.260]   I'm allowed to want things and I'm only allowed to,
[02:35:10.260 --> 02:35:12.340]   at moments in my life, even act on that,
[02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:14.580]   to turn that want into a fulfillment of my want.
[02:35:14.580 --> 02:35:16.200]   I think that actually goes back to what we were just saying,
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:18.420]   like versus how can I please you?
[02:35:18.420 --> 02:35:19.840]   Like maybe I want to do something.
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:22.740]   So I think that healthy entitlement, that's a good thing.
[02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:24.700]   But when I think, when I hear parents say like,
[02:35:24.700 --> 02:35:27.480]   please, I just don't want an entitled kid.
[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:29.040]   They're not talking about that, right?
[02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:31.080]   And they're talking about, and to me,
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:33.940]   the story from my practice is just the key thing
[02:35:33.940 --> 02:35:35.780]   that makes us parents cringe was this family
[02:35:35.780 --> 02:35:38.060]   I was seeing in New York City and they were,
[02:35:38.060 --> 02:35:41.780]   they were very wealthy and they had the 16-year-old son
[02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:44.700]   and they were flying back from Hawaii or to Hawaii
[02:35:44.700 --> 02:35:45.960]   and they were just getting ready to board
[02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:48.540]   and first class was boarding and the sun goes up
[02:35:48.540 --> 02:35:50.380]   and they're like, oh, so we were not,
[02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:52.900]   like in first class, we have to wait.
[02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:56.940]   He had basically a full tantrum in the airport,
[02:35:56.940 --> 02:36:00.220]   like every parent's first nightmare, literally.
[02:36:00.220 --> 02:36:01.640]   And they came to me afterwards being like,
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:04.480]   how did we, like, how did we get here, right?
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:06.260]   Now, this is a family, in general, too.
[02:36:06.260 --> 02:36:08.100]   They flew first class, they had private planes,
[02:36:08.100 --> 02:36:10.160]   had a lot of money, but entitlement to me
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:12.820]   doesn't always have to be about money.
[02:36:12.820 --> 02:36:14.400]   I'm gonna give you my definition of entitlement.
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:15.520]   I think it's very different.
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:18.020]   But to me, the definition like boundaries is useful
[02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:20.880]   because it gives you a pathway of what to do.
[02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:25.360]   I think entitlement is the fear of frustration.
[02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:27.340]   - Beautiful.
[02:36:27.340 --> 02:36:31.600]   - Because if we go back, okay,
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:33.560]   that thing didn't start at 16.
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:34.860]   And if we started, you know,
[02:36:34.860 --> 02:36:37.660]   I started kind of collecting stories and right,
[02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:40.340]   this is a kid who they had, and again,
[02:36:40.340 --> 02:36:41.180]   like they had a driver.
[02:36:41.180 --> 02:36:42.740]   There's nothing wrong with having a driver.
[02:36:42.740 --> 02:36:45.340]   But I'm just thinking about like waiting for a subway.
[02:36:45.340 --> 02:36:47.780]   It's frustrating, you just missed the subway.
[02:36:47.780 --> 02:36:49.100]   We're gonna be late.
[02:36:49.100 --> 02:36:50.940]   Like, no, right?
[02:36:50.940 --> 02:36:53.700]   This was a kid who didn't make,
[02:36:53.700 --> 02:36:54.660]   instead of seeing it older, remember,
[02:36:54.660 --> 02:36:56.100]   like didn't make the soccer team.
[02:36:56.100 --> 02:36:58.300]   Don't worry, we have someone who's gonna take you
[02:36:58.300 --> 02:36:59.820]   to the nearby town in New Jersey
[02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:01.660]   and get on that soccer team, right?
[02:37:02.820 --> 02:37:05.520]   And I think about what this kid started to learn
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:07.840]   about being frustrated.
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:11.920]   And it was kind of like, frustration comes up.
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:14.880]   And what gets layered next to it
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:19.680]   is someone else bringing you an exit.
[02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:21.800]   Frustration, exit from frustration.
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:25.860]   Maybe even exit to success, right?
[02:37:25.860 --> 02:37:26.820]   And then I started to think like,
[02:37:26.820 --> 02:37:28.740]   well, what would it be like
[02:37:28.740 --> 02:37:30.960]   if there was 16 years of kind of,
[02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:34.240]   of that pattern and that circuit reinforcing?
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:37.080]   'Cause what you're really learning as a kid,
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:40.520]   I'm frustrated, and that's very overwhelming for me,
[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:44.520]   but like the adults around me must be scared
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:46.700]   of my frustration because they won't let me sit in it.
[02:37:46.700 --> 02:37:47.600]   They won't let me feel it.
[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:49.940]   They will actually kind of run in circles
[02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:51.760]   to not have me feel.
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:55.840]   So I actually encode my frustration next to fear.
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:58.640]   Now I'm 16 and I'm expecting first class
[02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:01.840]   and I get lowly coach, you know?
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:05.160]   It's not, people are like, oh, what a spoiled kid.
[02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:07.640]   Like, I actually, I feel like this kid
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:09.600]   was like insanely vulnerable in that moment.
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:12.300]   This kid was like, I'm frustrated.
[02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:14.200]   And what I expect to happen
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:16.120]   and what I know to happen isn't here.
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:18.240]   And so it is explosive.
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:20.800]   It appears as entitlement on the surface,
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:23.440]   but it is a deep intolerance
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:26.720]   and almost fear of frustration, which is in your body.
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:29.000]   So you're terrified of a feeling
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.440]   that is living in your body.
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:36.080]   And it looks demanding because it kind of is desperate.
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:39.080]   Like you can't let this happen.
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:41.120]   - Wow.
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:46.760]   Fear of frustration as the definition of entitlement
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:49.460]   lands like square in the bull's eye for me.
[02:38:49.460 --> 02:38:52.640]   And yes, I think we all default
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:55.080]   to the kind of stereotypical example
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:58.400]   of the ultra wealthy family kid.
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:00.640]   There was that movie, "The Toy" in the '80s.
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:02.680]   It was really dreadful concept, actually.
[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:05.520]   You know, a kid that was just given everything
[02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:06.680]   and then wanted a person.
[02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:08.840]   It was really like, talk about foul.
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:11.460]   I mean, it's just bad at every level.
[02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:14.380]   And then they tried to create this narrative
[02:39:14.380 --> 02:39:16.440]   where then, you know, there's a deeper understanding
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:18.600]   about humans and stuff that evolves from it.
[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:21.160]   But the starting point was, you know,
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:24.400]   and I've observed this in certainly not my family,
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:27.200]   but other families where kids
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:29.840]   are given everything they want.
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:32.080]   It never feels like enough.
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:35.560]   Big surprise, dopamine is a real thing.
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:37.560]   The circuits recalibrate to a higher threshold.
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:39.240]   They want more and more and more.
[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:41.040]   It's like that movie, "Wall Street," what's your number?
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:43.520]   More, okay, all right.
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:45.920]   Nothing wrong with wanting things,
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:49.980]   but without a ceiling on any of that
[02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:54.860]   and without a ceiling on pleasure or bounds on experience,
[02:39:54.860 --> 02:39:56.260]   it crushes everybody.
[02:39:56.260 --> 02:39:57.800]   That's also what that movie was about.
[02:39:57.800 --> 02:39:59.580]   It just crushes people.
[02:39:59.580 --> 02:40:02.880]   So to build that into a child's neurology
[02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:05.740]   just seems like the worst possible thing.
[02:40:05.740 --> 02:40:07.460]   Because it's not about the world
[02:40:07.460 --> 02:40:09.620]   being a place of immense possibility.
[02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:11.540]   It's about the world being a place
[02:40:11.540 --> 02:40:13.860]   of like snakes in broken glass everywhere
[02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:18.020]   except this narrow knife edge path that you follow
[02:40:18.020 --> 02:40:20.300]   that is all about infinite resources.
[02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:21.740]   - And ease, that's right.
[02:40:21.740 --> 02:40:24.620]   And what I think is fear is 'cause if you're in fear,
[02:40:24.620 --> 02:40:25.840]   you're in like a threat state,
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:28.280]   which is why when kids are in that state or adults,
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:30.260]   it seems like nasty and it's mean.
[02:40:30.260 --> 02:40:34.100]   When there's this like narrowing of your eyes, right?
[02:40:34.100 --> 02:40:36.720]   So I think that's really what's happening.
[02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:41.180]   And it's not always tied to money, but the truth is,
[02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:46.180]   and money can easily buy a kid's way out of frustration.
[02:40:47.460 --> 02:40:49.340]   And by the way, it buys the parent
[02:40:49.340 --> 02:40:51.300]   out of having to tolerate their frustration
[02:40:51.300 --> 02:40:53.020]   while the kid is frustrated.
[02:40:53.020 --> 02:40:54.440]   And so it's tricky.
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:56.700]   I think I've now like talked to a bunch of parents
[02:40:56.700 --> 02:41:01.240]   who grew up in a very different way, were very successful.
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:02.080]   And I get it.
[02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:03.420]   They're like, I feel like I've earned,
[02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:04.860]   I've literally have earned the right
[02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:09.060]   to have certain parts of my life be a lot easier, right?
[02:41:09.060 --> 02:41:13.600]   And like, how do I raise a kid who isn't entitled, right?
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:15.540]   And it is a conundrum, right?
[02:41:15.540 --> 02:41:18.700]   Like I don't think like, you know,
[02:41:18.700 --> 02:41:21.120]   we raise our kids in a candy store,
[02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:23.660]   it's hard to expect them to appreciate candy, right?
[02:41:23.660 --> 02:41:26.160]   And so like, how do we balance that gratitude,
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:27.420]   the entitlement?
[02:41:27.420 --> 02:41:30.120]   And I do think though, that idea is like,
[02:41:30.120 --> 02:41:33.020]   we just have to, and sometimes like other people hearing
[02:41:33.020 --> 02:41:34.860]   this would be like, yeah, like my life is frustrating
[02:41:34.860 --> 02:41:35.700]   all the time.
[02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:37.300]   And some peoples are, right?
[02:41:37.300 --> 02:41:39.460]   They won't end up with entitlement.
[02:41:39.460 --> 02:41:41.500]   But for other families, they always have to be like,
[02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:43.340]   I have to like dose it.
[02:41:43.340 --> 02:41:46.540]   I have to make sure my kids literally have experiences
[02:41:46.540 --> 02:41:48.280]   and I probably have to go through it too.
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:51.700]   Where we are almost like purposefully making sure
[02:41:51.700 --> 02:41:54.660]   they get enough of that, you know,
[02:41:54.660 --> 02:41:56.560]   so they can build different circuits.
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:42:00.080]   - Yeah, so much done back there.
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:05.080]   I think it's clear that some of this is tied
[02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:07.560]   to financial means.
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:11.780]   I think it's a pretty scary thing
[02:42:11.780 --> 02:42:13.820]   when someone looks out on the landscape of the world
[02:42:13.820 --> 02:42:17.580]   as infinite possibility without any frustration.
[02:42:17.580 --> 02:42:21.340]   As we talked about earlier, the ability to lean
[02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:24.780]   into hard things as a skill that can extend
[02:42:24.780 --> 02:42:27.680]   to other things is so valuable.
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:29.620]   Do you think that some of the smaller practices
[02:42:29.620 --> 02:42:33.840]   that any kid, any parent, any family, regardless of means
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:35.260]   can lean into can really help there?
[02:42:35.260 --> 02:42:39.020]   Like, you know, some people say grace or a prayer
[02:42:39.020 --> 02:42:41.340]   before a meal, others simply express gratitude,
[02:42:41.340 --> 02:42:43.460]   but, you know, stopping and thinking about, you know,
[02:42:43.460 --> 02:42:45.820]   I mean, being breathing, being ambulatory,
[02:42:45.820 --> 02:42:50.660]   being any number of good things that allow us agency in life,
[02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:52.260]   about to eat food.
[02:42:52.260 --> 02:42:56.140]   I mean, those moments I think are,
[02:42:56.140 --> 02:42:59.980]   I know that our nervous system reflects on those.
[02:42:59.980 --> 02:43:01.300]   How could they not?
[02:43:01.300 --> 02:43:03.120]   And just recognizing that at least something went
[02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:05.540]   into the creation of the meal.
[02:43:05.540 --> 02:43:07.060]   - I think for like the entitlement stuff
[02:43:07.060 --> 02:43:09.620]   and the frustration, like there's all these small moments
[02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:10.940]   that we can start to make a difference.
[02:43:10.940 --> 02:43:12.220]   And I think it's saying to yourself,
[02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:14.920]   just 'cause I can doesn't mean I will.
[02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:19.160]   So like my kid's young and I pick them up from a play date.
[02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:21.420]   And let's say I have a babysitter at home
[02:43:21.420 --> 02:43:22.540]   or my husband at home.
[02:43:22.540 --> 02:43:24.980]   And I'm like, I have to go to a store on some errands.
[02:43:24.980 --> 02:43:27.220]   My kid's like, can you drop me off first?
[02:43:27.220 --> 02:43:28.240]   Maybe I'm like, you know what?
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:31.380]   Like, no, like you're gonna come with me.
[02:43:31.380 --> 02:43:33.200]   I'm not gonna say this, I'm boring errands
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:35.460]   because you just have to tolerate that.
[02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:38.660]   Like sometimes you have to do things you don't wanna do.
[02:43:38.660 --> 02:43:41.940]   And like, you are not gonna learn that by me telling you that
[02:43:41.940 --> 02:43:45.500]   you're gonna learn that by experiencing that.
[02:43:45.500 --> 02:43:48.500]   You know, something with my kids, you know, the other day
[02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:50.900]   we were at an airport and like there were, you know
[02:43:50.900 --> 02:43:53.200]   in the airport, like it kind of winds around like to get
[02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:54.040]   and there was like no one there.
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:58.060]   So they started to like duck under all the like things.
[02:43:58.060 --> 02:44:00.020]   And it just made me think like as a small moment
[02:44:00.020 --> 02:44:02.620]   like entitlement also was like the rules don't apply
[02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:03.460]   to me in some way.
[02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:04.920]   It sounds like, and I just remember you guys
[02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:05.760]   when we're in airports.
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:08.480]   - I know that the lines leading up to security.
[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:10.760]   - Yeah, and you can duck and sometimes you like mess them up
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:11.760]   and it wasn't like forever.
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:13.320]   But I was like, you guys like these things,
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:16.800]   someone put these here for a reason and we're just gonna,
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:19.160]   it's like, these things have to be such,
[02:44:19.160 --> 02:44:20.800]   it's a small amount of frustration.
[02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:22.880]   But it's just like, I don't always get to duck the line.
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:25.040]   Sometimes I have to like walk a little longer.
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:27.520]   I remember my kids saying, and I'm not immune to this.
[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:31.160]   Like I am in a financial position where I have someone come,
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:32.960]   sometimes help me be my housekeeper, right?
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:34.280]   And she'll fold the laundry.
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:37.240]   I remember on a Sunday, my son said to me when he was
[02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:39.320]   younger, like, why do we have to fold the laundry?
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:40.420]   Kind of like, I don't think he said it,
[02:44:40.420 --> 02:44:42.960]   but he was kind of like, don't we have someone, you know,
[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:44.000]   who could do that?
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.640]   And I remember being like, this is a moment where I could,
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:48.640]   we're gonna fold the laundry on Sundays.
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:49.920]   You know who loves folding laundry?
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:51.680]   Maybe some people like, I don't,
[02:44:51.680 --> 02:44:53.480]   I don't love undoing the dishwasher.
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:55.880]   It is inherently not that enjoyable.
[02:44:55.880 --> 02:44:59.320]   But like, and so frustrating, it's just like not great.
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:02.480]   And like, I know I need to make my kids do that.
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:06.340]   Like they just have to go through that mundane thing.
[02:45:06.340 --> 02:45:08.560]   And so I think there's all of these moments,
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:10.460]   taking your kid with you on errands, you know,
[02:45:10.460 --> 02:45:12.840]   doing the laundry, right?
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:14.920]   Before you say to your kid,
[02:45:14.920 --> 02:45:17.480]   let's go to try out on another soccer team.
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:19.400]   Just like, oh, you didn't make the team.
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:21.380]   Maybe, maybe let it go two days.
[02:45:21.380 --> 02:45:23.400]   That's at least two more days of feeling upset
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:24.600]   and frustrated, right?
[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:25.960]   They don't have to be these big grand things,
[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:28.160]   but all of those little moments can add up
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:29.720]   in a really positive way.
[02:45:29.720 --> 02:45:31.360]   - What's your stance on household chores
[02:45:31.360 --> 02:45:33.920]   and should kids be paid for household chores?
[02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:36.760]   - Yes, I have a whole guide to chores and allowance.
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:38.840]   And I actually, you know, I think there's a lot of thought,
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:40.160]   like, should they be separate?
[02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:41.960]   I don't know, I think it could be done either way.
[02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:44.920]   But to me, the question for a parent is like,
[02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:46.240]   what is the point for me?
[02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:48.020]   Like, what is my goal for chores?
[02:45:48.020 --> 02:45:50.200]   What is my goal for allowance, right?
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:52.600]   And I think that has to then structure how we do it.
[02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:56.000]   So my guess is for chores, part of it is,
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.200]   I want my kid to, number one,
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:45:59.500]   maybe like help around the house.
[02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:00.680]   I want them to have that purpose.
[02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:02.040]   Also, like, I know for me for chores,
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:06.020]   like sometimes your life involves doing boring things.
[02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:07.160]   That is just true.
[02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:09.160]   And like, I want my kids to know that,
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:10.400]   which means they have to experience it.
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:12.320]   That's one of the reasons we do chores.
[02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:14.320]   So for me, if that's one of the reasons,
[02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:16.060]   I'm not gonna pay my kid.
[02:46:16.060 --> 02:46:17.980]   Because for me and my family,
[02:46:17.980 --> 02:46:20.000]   what I think my kids need to get out of it
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.560]   is just like knowing that sometimes you do boring things
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:23.860]   as part of being a good human.
[02:46:23.860 --> 02:46:25.680]   For someone else, that might be totally different.
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:27.720]   So I think we just ask ourselves as parents,
[02:46:27.720 --> 02:46:29.520]   like, what am I trying to accomplish?
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:31.980]   And then let me structure it around that.
[02:46:31.980 --> 02:46:33.600]   - Across the course of today's discussion,
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:37.160]   I've been feeling both immense gratitude and relief
[02:46:37.160 --> 02:46:40.640]   for certain quote unquote hardships that I experienced
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:42.560]   and things that my parents made me do
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:43.920]   or ways that they were negligent.
[02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:45.700]   And I was forced to figure things out.
[02:46:45.700 --> 02:46:48.000]   Also, you know, some things where I was like,
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:49.440]   huh, like wish they had done this.
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:52.800]   I think everyone listening to this will feel that way.
[02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:54.240]   And if you're lucky enough to still be
[02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:58.080]   in the parenting child or being a child process,
[02:46:58.080 --> 02:46:59.440]   then there's still time.
[02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:01.280]   So I guess there's always still time.
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:04.440]   In my introduction to this episode,
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:05.680]   I touched on a few of these,
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:08.880]   but tell us what you're doing these days
[02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:13.560]   to help parents and kids indirectly or directly
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:16.360]   to be more effective in their relationships.
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:20.840]   And, you know, I know you've written about this in books
[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:23.960]   and you have a wonderful social media account on Instagram
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:26.200]   and elsewhere, I follow it.
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:28.160]   And there's oh, so much learning there.
[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:32.080]   But, you know, how are you translating this knowledge
[02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:34.720]   into actionable programs?
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:37.620]   - Yeah, that is my, like,
[02:47:37.620 --> 02:47:39.120]   that is what gets me out of bed every morning
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:39.940]   is translating.
[02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:42.720]   I always say deep thoughts, actionable, practical,
[02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:43.960]   can do with today's strategies.
[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:44.780]   - Yes.
[02:47:44.780 --> 02:47:45.680]   - That's the only way I can work.
[02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:47.800]   I'm like, tell me what to do to put that idea into action.
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:48.640]   - Love it.
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:52.040]   - So, you know, a couple of years ago,
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:54.920]   one of the things that really struck me was just like,
[02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:55.920]   I really did feel angry.
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:47:57.480]   Like, this is so messed up.
[02:47:57.480 --> 02:47:59.160]   We parents have the hardest job
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:01.360]   and it's the one that impacts the world the most.
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:02.860]   And I don't think any of us think the world
[02:48:02.860 --> 02:48:05.960]   is in like a great place right now, right?
[02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:06.800]   - Nah, it's not.
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:07.760]   - Right.
[02:48:07.760 --> 02:48:10.320]   And this is, and I remember someone coming up to me
[02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:12.400]   and saying, parenting is also the only job
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:13.920]   you care about on your death bed.
[02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:16.220]   And I think that's probably true if you have kids.
[02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:20.280]   So like, for every reason, this should be the place
[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:23.180]   that they're, like, that we invest the most
[02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:25.980]   and that the system is like set up to help us, right?
[02:48:25.980 --> 02:48:27.900]   And most people I know, they don't wanna parent
[02:48:27.900 --> 02:48:30.420]   the exact same way as they were parented, maybe take parts.
[02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:32.500]   And that is the way we'll parent,
[02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:34.520]   just kind of the language we use.
[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:38.020]   And learning a new language we know is totally possible.
[02:48:38.020 --> 02:48:39.660]   Like Duolingo has showed us that.
[02:48:39.660 --> 02:48:41.220]   You can learn a new language.
[02:48:41.220 --> 02:48:42.060]   It's hard.
[02:48:42.060 --> 02:48:43.820]   Sometimes you revert to your language of origin,
[02:48:43.820 --> 02:48:45.640]   especially in stressful moments, same thing in parenting,
[02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:46.860]   and then you go back.
[02:48:46.860 --> 02:48:49.900]   And so I remember saying to some people around me, like,
[02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:54.660]   I wanna create that, like, kind of Duolingo for parents.
[02:48:54.660 --> 02:48:58.360]   It is learning a new language and we should have a product
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:00.620]   where we have resources in one place.
[02:49:00.620 --> 02:49:02.540]   We should be able to connect to other parents
[02:49:02.540 --> 02:49:03.380]   around the globe.
[02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:04.620]   We were kind of doing this with us.
[02:49:04.620 --> 02:49:06.240]   We should have access to experts we trust,
[02:49:06.240 --> 02:49:07.900]   not because they always know better,
[02:49:07.900 --> 02:49:10.060]   but they might just help us have a different mindset
[02:49:10.060 --> 02:49:11.900]   and some ideas to help us again.
[02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:14.460]   And me, my mind is just act more in line
[02:49:14.460 --> 02:49:15.340]   with your own values.
[02:49:15.340 --> 02:49:16.520]   That's what it's about.
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:18.780]   And so that's what we created and that's what I'm working on
[02:49:18.780 --> 02:49:20.460]   and that's our Good Inside membership.
[02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:24.240]   And so excited about all the ways, you know,
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:27.700]   that's already impacting tens and tens of thousands
[02:49:27.700 --> 02:49:30.260]   of parents and that's where the resources are.
[02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:32.120]   It's bite-sized, it's actionable.
[02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:33.420]   We're really known for our scripts.
[02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:35.200]   It's like, what do I say to my kid when?
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:38.740]   Like, literally a joke, like, we have a script for that.
[02:49:38.740 --> 02:49:40.660]   And I think in a small way, people like say,
[02:49:40.660 --> 02:49:41.900]   like, I come for the scripts
[02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:44.060]   and then I stay for the revolution.
[02:49:44.060 --> 02:49:46.460]   Like, this is actually a journey of my own sturdiness
[02:49:46.460 --> 02:49:50.220]   and honestly becoming a sturdier, more confident leader
[02:49:50.220 --> 02:49:53.060]   is the only way we can raise sturdy, more confident kids.
[02:49:53.060 --> 02:49:55.580]   - Wow, I've said this again and again
[02:49:55.580 --> 02:49:57.840]   throughout today's discussion, but I love it.
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:02.040]   I love the gathering of information,
[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:04.860]   the organizing it and dispersing it in actionable ways.
[02:50:04.860 --> 02:50:06.660]   And you've done all of that
[02:50:06.660 --> 02:50:08.100]   and you're continuing to do that.
[02:50:08.100 --> 02:50:09.860]   And you also have the clinical background
[02:50:09.860 --> 02:50:11.020]   and you're a parent.
[02:50:11.020 --> 02:50:13.060]   So you're speaking from professional
[02:50:13.060 --> 02:50:15.100]   and immediate experience.
[02:50:15.100 --> 02:50:18.560]   And you put, oh, so much work into it.
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:23.500]   I can tell that by the directness and simplicity
[02:50:23.500 --> 02:50:26.740]   of the actionables that you've taught us today.
[02:50:26.740 --> 02:50:29.580]   And also how much resides underneath
[02:50:29.580 --> 02:50:34.580]   those direct, simple actionables, just beautiful.
[02:50:34.580 --> 02:50:36.900]   I've had many conversations on this podcast
[02:50:36.900 --> 02:50:40.760]   with many brilliant people, including yourself.
[02:50:40.760 --> 02:50:43.780]   But this is among the ones that I really say
[02:50:43.780 --> 02:50:45.580]   has really me thinking.
[02:50:45.580 --> 02:50:46.980]   And I don't think I've ever said, wow,
[02:50:46.980 --> 02:50:49.480]   so many times during the discussion here.
[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:52.060]   And there's just so much knowledge to be gleaned
[02:50:52.060 --> 02:50:54.200]   from today's discussion, thanks to you.
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:57.920]   And I just, on behalf of myself and everyone listening,
[02:50:57.920 --> 02:51:00.700]   parents and kids and those who want to be parents
[02:51:00.700 --> 02:51:05.700]   and those who don't and who have made the choice not to
[02:51:05.700 --> 02:51:09.940]   and are certainly engaged in other forms of relationship.
[02:51:09.940 --> 02:51:14.180]   And this is just absolute gold that you've provided us.
[02:51:14.180 --> 02:51:17.020]   So thank you ever so much.
[02:51:17.020 --> 02:51:21.140]   Your generosity, your clarity of communication
[02:51:21.140 --> 02:51:24.300]   and the heart behind it really comes through.
[02:51:24.300 --> 02:51:25.940]   So thank you.
[02:51:25.940 --> 02:51:27.740]   - Thank you so much.
[02:51:27.740 --> 02:51:29.580]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:51:29.580 --> 02:51:32.240]   about parent-child and other types of relationships

[02:52:27.980 --> 02:52:29.360]   Not so much on today's episode,
[02:52:29.360 --> 02:52:31.900]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:52:31.900 --> 02:52:33.500]   we discuss supplements.
[02:52:33.500 --> 02:52:35.620]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:52:35.620 --> 02:52:37.860]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:39.560]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:52:39.560 --> 02:52:42.500]   for improving hormone function, and for improving focus.
[02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:44.100]   To learn more about the supplements discussed
[02:52:44.100 --> 02:52:45.580]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:52:45.580 --> 02:52:47.940]   visit Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[02:52:47.940 --> 02:52:50.880]   so that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[02:52:50.880 --> 02:52:53.180]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:52:53.180 --> 02:52:55.980]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:52:55.980 --> 02:52:57.380]   So that's Instagram, Twitter,
[02:52:57.380 --> 02:53:00.580]   now called X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Threads.
[02:53:00.580 --> 02:53:01.900]   And on all those platforms,
[02:53:01.900 --> 02:53:03.980]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:53:03.980 --> 02:53:05.520]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:53:05.520 --> 02:53:06.880]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:53:06.880 --> 02:53:09.060]   but much of which is distinct from the content covered
[02:53:09.060 --> 02:53:10.580]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:53:10.580 --> 02:53:14.100]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:53:14.100 --> 02:53:15.420]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:53:15.420 --> 02:53:17.600]   to our monthly neural network newsletter,
[02:53:17.600 --> 02:53:20.600]   our neural network newsletter is a zero-cost newsletter
[02:53:20.600 --> 02:53:23.220]   that includes podcast summaries and protocols
[02:53:23.220 --> 02:53:25.560]   as short one- to three-page PDFs.
[02:53:25.560 --> 02:53:27.920]   For instance, we have zero-cost protocols
[02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:31.140]   for improving sleep, for improving dopamine function,
[02:53:31.140 --> 02:53:33.140]   for deliberate cold exposure, for fitness,
[02:53:33.140 --> 02:53:35.960]   for learning and neuroplasticity, and much more.
[02:53:35.960 --> 02:53:37.140]   To sign up for the newsletter,
[02:53:37.140 --> 02:53:40.500]   simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the Menu tab,

[02:53:43.140 --> 02:53:45.340]   Again, the newsletter is completely zero-cost,
[02:53:45.340 --> 02:53:46.180]   and I want to emphasize
[02:53:46.180 --> 02:53:48.660]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:53:48.660 --> 02:53:50.120]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:53.100]   for today's discussion with Dr. Becky Kennedy.
[02:53:53.100 --> 02:53:55.300]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:53:55.300 --> 02:53:57.220]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:53:57.220 --> 02:53:59.800]   (upbeat music)
[02:53:59.800 --> 02:54:02.380]   (upbeat music)
