[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - How do you define a trauma and why do you think it is
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.740]   that traumas tend to lock us into a state
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.260]   that was representative of an earlier time?
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.500]   Why is it that it's so linked
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.680]   to this thing of time perception?
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.540]   - Yeah, the why question I can't totally answer,
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.060]   but it definitely is.
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.980]   And for me, traumas aren't necessarily traumatizing.
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.440]   So something bad happens to you.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.620]   And if you can access what you and Martha Beck
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.060]   were calling the self, capitalize,
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.100]   and you go to the part of you that got hurt
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.140]   by what happened, instead of pushing it away
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.180]   and locking it up, and you embrace it,
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.340]   and you bring it closer to you,
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.660]   which means going to your suffering,
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.540]   which is counter to what most of us try to do.
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.020]   But if you were to do that and you could help it
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.080]   unload the feelings it got from the trauma,
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.900]   then you're not traumatized.
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.820]   What's traumatizing is something bad happens,
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.020]   these more vulnerable parts of us,
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.700]   the most sensitive parts of us get hurt
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.980]   or feel worthless because of what happened
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.380]   or get terrified, and then we lock them away
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.500]   because we don't want to feel that feeling anymore.
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.780]   And everybody around us tells us to just let it go,
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.380]   just move on, don't look back.
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.760]   And so we wind up exiling our most sensitive parts
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.460]   simply because they got hurt.
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.260]   And then when you have a lot of exiles,
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.740]   you feel more delicate, the world seems more dangerous,
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.220]   'cause anything could trigger that.
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.780]   And when they get triggered, they'll blow up,
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.340]   they'll take over.
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.780]   So it's like these flames of raw emotion come popping out.
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.140]   So other parts are forced into these manager roles
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.060]   or these protective roles.
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.180]   And some of them are trying to manage your life
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.840]   so that you don't get triggered anymore,
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.860]   so that, for example, nobody gets close enough to you
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.100]   to trigger any of that.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.500]   Or so you look really good so you don't get rejected
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.700]   or perform at a really high level
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.020]   to counter the worthlessness.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.820]   Many of those become the critics
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.020]   because in their effort to try to get you to look good,
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.780]   they're yelling at you to try and behave
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.440]   and do what they want so you look better.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.580]   And then there are other what we call manager protectors
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.580]   that are, for some people, particularly women,
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.920]   have these massive caretaking parts
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.660]   that don't let them take care of themselves
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.100]   and take care of everybody else.
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.580]   And so I could go on and on.
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.420]   There's a lot of common manager roles.
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.740]   And I want to make clear as I'm talking about this
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.620]   that these are not the essence of the parts,
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.820]   and that's a big mistake that most of the field has made
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.900]   is to assume the critic
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.460]   is just an internalized, critical, parental voice
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.300]   instead of listening to it
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.900]   and hearing that it's desperately trying to protect you.
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.720]   So none of these are what they seem.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.700]   That's the role they've been forced into.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.580]   And the analogy, again, is to an external family
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.300]   like kids in dysfunctional families
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.060]   are forced into these extreme roles
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.220]   that aren't who they are.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.600]   It's the role they got forced into
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.860]   by the dynamics of the family.
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.160]   So the same is true with this internal family.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.900]   So most of us have a lot of what we call managers.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.220]   They got us here.
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.180]   They help us in our careers,
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.060]   and they, other systems would call them the defenses
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.900]   or the ego.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.740]   And, you know, in spirituality, they get vilified, too.
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.660]   But their whole MO is keep everything under control,
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.340]   please everybody, and you'll survive.
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.740]   The world has a way of breaking through those defenses,
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.700]   triggering an exile.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.940]   When that happens, it's a big emergency
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.420]   'cause, again, these flames of raw emotion
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.900]   are gonna overwhelm you
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.420]   and make you have trouble functioning
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.020]   or even getting out of bed.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.740]   So there are other parts that immediately go into action
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.260]   to deal with that emergency.
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.380]   And in contrast to these managers,
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.500]   they're impulsive, reactive, damn the torpedoes.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.860]   I don't care about the collateral damage to your body,
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.580]   to your relationships.
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.700]   I just got to get you higher than those flames
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.860]   or douse them with some substance
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.180]   or distract you till they burn themselves out.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.740]   So we call those firefighters.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.060]   And again, these are just the roles.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.340]   When released from these roles,
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.860]   they'll transform into being something very valuable.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.460]   [upbeat music]
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.020]   [dramatic music]
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.600]   (upbeat music)
