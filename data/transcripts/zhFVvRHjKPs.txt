[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:13.040]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.800]   Many people in the finance industry
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.960]   love to dunk on regular people, mom and pop,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.560]   for not knowing what they're doing,
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.560]   for being inept at saving and investing.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.440]   I think reading about behavioral finance
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.120]   makes finance people feel somewhat superior
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.480]   to their peers, other people, not our audience.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.080]   Every week, we get emails from people who diligently
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.200]   save their money, improve their career prospects.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.200]   Their people are doing their best
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.160]   to achieve financial freedom,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.600]   but they still have questions, right?
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.160]   These people are in a great place financially,
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.200]   and they still have questions,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200]   which shows you how difficult it can be
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.320]   because you have this uncertainty we're dealing with.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.680]   It's okay to admit you need help.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.840]   Every year, I feel like I learn more and more,
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.740]   and it just makes me realize
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.080]   how much more I still have to learn.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.240]   So that's what we're doing here at The Compound.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.640]   We're learning together, Duncan.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.480]   Come on this journey with us.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.320]   - Sure, I learn every week. - Our email here,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.120]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.000]   Today's show is sponsored by Bird Dogs.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.920]   It's my Bird Dogs hat.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.680]   I'm not a big hat guy, usually, right?
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.280]   Josh does the flat-brimmed thing.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.840]   Michael does the dad hat thing.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.300]   You have a huge collection of hats.
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.980]   You wear all kinds of hats.
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.620]   So this one, much like the Bird Dog shorts and pants
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.640]   and the warm-up sweats they have,
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640]   it's breathable, it's stretchy.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.880]   You know, I'm not much of a hat guy,
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.040]   but in the summer, I'm out on the lake, I'm at the beach.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.280]   - Out to brag. - I'm doing bike rides
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.320]   with the kids and the boat, and it's a lot of wind.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.560]   And I wear products in my hair, but still,
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.800]   sometimes it just, it's not good being outside
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.440]   so much from being so active, so you need a hat.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.360]   And so Bird Dogs has this new hat where if you go,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.240]   let's say you go buy a pair of their shorts, right?
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.800]   Birddogs.com/ATC for Ask the Compound.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.520]   Put in promo code ATC and you'll get this hat for free.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.680]   It's a nice tech-stretch hat.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.880]   I like it, and I'm a simple man
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.520]   when it comes to investing in fashion, right?
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.520]   I like to keep things simple and not a lot of words on this,
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.520]   just a simple picture, it's white, and it's comfy.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.020]   So again, Birddogs.com/ATC.
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.600]   Enter code ATC and you get a free hat just like this.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.560]   I do look like I'm going for a golf game after this.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.240]   I will admit that.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.080]   But if you're gonna do golf or tennis or something,
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.200]   Bird Dogs are the way to go.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.640]   - Yeah, you look like you're heading out to the courts
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.620]   right after this, you know?
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.760]   Maybe pickleball?
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.040]   Are you a pickleball person?
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.180]   - I'm a tennis pro.
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.240]   - So they also sent us this.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.120]   So maybe foreshadowing, something to come?
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.080]   I don't know. - I like it.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.960]   - We don't know yet, so thanks, Bird Dogs.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.280]   - All right, let's go to some questions.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.880]   - Oh, also, before we get started,
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.080]   your intro just made me think, for people new here,
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.640]   I guess we never really explained the setup of this show.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.360]   I have people sometimes reach out and I'm like,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.280]   Duncan doesn't know anything about finance
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.140]   for a finance professional.
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.720]   I'm not a finance professional.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.480]   I'm a creative, I'm the video guy.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.520]   I'm a producer. - You're the guy
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.360]   behind the guy.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.360]   We pulled Duncan from, he was a professor.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.840]   Duncan went to film school.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.800]   We needed someone to help us make our videos look better
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.080]   'cause we didn't know what we were doing.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.400]   And Duncan is on the production side of things, so.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   - Right, yeah, not a financial--
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.740]   - Duncan is not a financial person.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.280]   The Oatly call options
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.960]   should have been the sign there for people.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.060]   - Sure, sure, I would have done it.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.600]   (laughing)
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.120]   Okay, up first today, we have the following.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.360]   This is a two-parter, so hang in there.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.340]   We have a 3% mortgage and $200,000 in equity
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.600]   since purchasing in 2015, but it's a tiny place
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.200]   and we want more space for our family of four.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.520]   With interest rates so high
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.480]   and given the fact that we love our neighborhood,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.000]   we would rather add a second story than move.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.320]   We don't have nearly enough save
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.920]   to cover the $250,000 price our architect is estimating.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.100]   A HELOC seems like the only financing option
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.940]   that could make sense,
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.420]   but we need to withdraw the full amount we're eligible for.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.920]   We could begin to pay off the loan immediately
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.240]   and would be done in about 15 years.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.520]   Our hope is that interest rates
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.520]   would come down in the future,
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   but even at the current rate,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.360]   this would be doable
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.180]   without reducing retirement contributions
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.920]   or tapping our modest emergency fund.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.840]   Page two, John.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.120]   We are early 40s and federal employees
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.220]   making about $300,000 a year.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.840]   We have no other debts and don't foresee any windfalls
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.520]   or additional income streams in the near future.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.680]   Obviously, the safest choice would be to keep saving
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.520]   until we can pay for the addition,
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.840]   but that would take us a number of years
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.360]   during the time we'd be getting the most utility
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.320]   out of having a bigger home while our kids are still young.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.960]   We want immediate gratification.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.740]   Is it foolish to max out a HELOC to fund an addition?
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.320]   Is there a significant chance
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.000]   that interest rates shoot up even higher
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.480]   and leave us scrambling?
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.640]   Are there creative solutions we aren't considering?
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.360]   So, just before you get into that second to last part,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.880]   maybe explain for people like me that don't understand,
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.960]   why would rates moving
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.240]   after they've done the HELOC impact them?
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.680]   - Because unless you're doing a cash out refinance,
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.080]   you're not exactly locking in the rates.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.920]   These rates float.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.680]   It's like LIBOR or something plus
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.120]   a spread.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.240]   So, right now, my HELOC rate is like 8%.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.440]   So, it kind of moves with mortgage rates.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   So, it's not, again, if you did a cash out refinance,
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.240]   you'd lock that in, that's your rate.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.560]   But with the HELOC line of credit, that moved.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.560]   So, mine was 3% a couple years ago.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.400]   Now, it's like eight.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.200]   And so, I know it sounds like a lot of money
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.160]   to be pulling out and a lot of debt,
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.740]   but this idea makes sense to me.
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.780]   This is the whole idea behind taking out HELOC.
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.160]   So, you have to think about it
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.740]   in terms of opportunity costs as well.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.740]   How much would it cost if you're moving to a new house
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.120]   with a new higher rate mortgage
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.640]   plus house price appreciation?
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.840]   You'd probably be spending way more money.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.960]   So, this is, I don't know.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.600]   I look at this like taking on a 50 or 40 or 60% mortgage,
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.360]   however much your house is.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.680]   So, you have no debt.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.560]   You can afford the monthly payments.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.860]   It doesn't impact your retirement or emergency fund
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.240]   or 529 contributions.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.600]   You can pay it off in a reasonable period of time.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.560]   I say, what good is that equity doing sitting in your house
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.620]   if you have the ability to use it, right?
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.040]   So, why wait if you have a family,
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.380]   you love the neighborhood,
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.800]   you obviously wanna stay there for the long haul.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.240]   This makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.160]   The whole point of the home equity loan in the first place
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.840]   is it's tax deductible interest.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.320]   You have this asset that you can borrow against.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.600]   Most of these lines of credit
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.220]   give you a 10-year grace period
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.560]   where you can invest and pay it off interest only.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.920]   So, you have some flexibility there too.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.320]   So, let's say rates could go up higher.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.840]   I don't know, mortgage rates could hit 8%
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.680]   and this HELOC could be 9, 10%.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.760]   It's possible.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.800]   It's not out of the realm of possibilities.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.280]   I tend to think eventually--
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.800]   - Right, so there's no cap to what it could go to.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.280]   - Yeah, so rates could go higher if they keep going up.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.520]   I don't think the economy or housing market
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.280]   can handle 8% to 9% interest rates for very long,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.380]   but it's possible so that it could take a while longer
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.040]   than we think to go down.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.840]   - Sorry, I meant for the HELOC rate,
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.960]   but there's no upper band.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.760]   - If rates keep going up, it could keep going up,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.320]   just like mortgage rates, right?
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.000]   So, then you also have 15 years
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.360]   from the time that interest-only period is done
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.200]   to then pay it off.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.840]   So, we're talking like a 25-year period to pay it off,
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.880]   and they think they can pay it off in 15.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.280]   So, I don't see why you need to get more creative than this.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.320]   It's a secured loan.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.160]   You have the equity.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.800]   You have the ability to service the debt.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.400]   I know it's scary taking on that much,
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.600]   but I mean, just like,
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.020]   the only thing I would be worried about
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.960]   is the fact that it's probably gonna cost more
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.240]   than you think and it's gonna take longer than you think.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.240]   That's the thing I'd be worried about
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.240]   as much as the borrowing.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.560]   If you wanna get creative,
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.680]   you could do, like when we did our basement,
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.680]   I've mentioned before,
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.920]   this was only like a 30, $35,000 project back in the day.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.360]   I use 0% credit cards.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.680]   We talked about this on Animal Spirits this week
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.080]   a little bit, and it gives you like a 12, 15,
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.000]   18-month cushion if you wanna have that.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.080]   Obviously, you're probably not gonna be able
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.040]   to get $250,000 worth of 0% credit cards,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.280]   but you could use it for a little bit of spending
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.240]   if you wanted to shelter from that HELOC rates for a while
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.800]   and hope they come down in the meantime.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.880]   But I highly doubt you'll regret this decision
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.440]   in the future, especially if you have a family.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.840]   And again, you wanna stay in that area
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.320]   and you wanna make the house how you want to make it.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.520]   So I see no problem with this.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.480]   - I mean, the one thing that came to mind for me, though,
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.480]   is what you're talking about.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.400]   How long is that gonna take to do that addition?
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.800]   So if they're really looking to maximize time,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.040]   probably getting into another place would be faster, right?
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.240]   But I know they say they like their neighborhood
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.080]   and that kind of thing.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.840]   - Yeah, and I think this is probably gonna be
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.560]   the cheaper route, especially since you're using the equity.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.440]   Yes, you're still borrowing,
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.320]   but you're not borrowing the full amount of a house.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.040]   It's this addition.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.840]   So I'm guessing borrowing for a new place
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.520]   would be a lot more if you like the house
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.760]   and you can handle the construction period,
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.220]   which again, takes longer than you probably think.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.360]   This is the whole point of these loans in the first place.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.620]   I say, I don't see a problem with this.
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.120]   - Yeah, makes sense.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.960]   - Do it.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.660]   - Cool.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.480]   And that was from Ian. - Next question.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.400]   - So our next question is from Dan.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.360]   I'm anticipating needing to replace
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.440]   both the roof on my house and a car five years from now.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.680]   I would like to have $100,000 set aside
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.320]   for these expenses.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.200]   I wonder how many know they're gonna need a new roof
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.560]   in five years, but that's neither here nor there.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.980]   Five years out feels like an investment no man's land.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.360]   Stocks seem to be a bit risky in that timeframe
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.140]   and high interest savings, while attractive now,
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.320]   will likely have lower rates
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.160]   if the Fed cuts at some point.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.560]   I've also considered doing something
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.640]   like a target date fund through a robo-advisor
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.160]   and having it managed for stock and bond allocations,
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.960]   decreasing risk over time.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.280]   Do you have recommendations for how to allocate savings
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.280]   given this timeframe?
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.440]   - Google tells me 25 to 30 years for a good shingle, Duncan.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.960]   So maybe they've got the clock winding down here.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.800]   I like this question.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.400]   We got two renovation questions right away.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.760]   This person is going the opposite
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.160]   where they're not gonna borrow for it.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.240]   They're going to save every penny,
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.780]   which is a different way of looking at it.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.960]   If we were looking at a simple lump sum
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.840]   that you had the money, you had the 100 grand right now
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.280]   and you just wanted to save it,
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.480]   this would be an easy question.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.420]   Put your money into a five-year treasury.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.080]   You got a perfect asset liability match.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.760]   You can probably get 4.5% right now
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.800]   in a five-year treasury, something like that.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.640]   Call it a day.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.940]   That's a pretty good return for the asset liability match.
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.040]   The fact that you're saving money periodically
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.440]   and that until you reach that goal,
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.860]   it kind of changes the equation a little bit,
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.600]   but I think we can still use the five-year time horizon
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.560]   to see like, are stocks too risky for this kind of goal?
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.000]   So John, give me a chart on.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.320]   This is five-year rolling returns for the S&P 500
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.640]   going back to 1926.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.240]   You can see they're all over the place.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.800]   Most of them are above zero.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.360]   John, next chart for another way of looking at these,
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.200]   kind of ranking them.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.600]   This is going from worst to best.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.440]   You can see most returns over a five-year period.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.160]   These are total returns.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.720]   They don't include inflation and taxes and fees
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.320]   and all the usual caveats here,
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.400]   but we're talking 88% of the time,
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.440]   returns are positive on a five-year window
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.720]   over the past hundred years or so.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.240]   The bad news is, you can do chart off, John,
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.200]   the range of returns from worst to best is huge.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.600]   So the worst five-year return ever, down 61%.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.800]   The best five-year return ever, up almost 370%.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.640]   Pretty wide range.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.480]   Now, to be fair,
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.800]   a lot of these five-year windows occurred in the 1930s,
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   but even if you look at post-World War II data,
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.160]   the worst five-year return was almost a loss of 30%.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.400]   The best was like 270% gain.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.320]   I have a relatively high tolerance for risk,
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.400]   but if I'm investing for a specific goal
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.640]   in a specific timeframe,
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.600]   and I know I'm gonna have to spend it,
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.120]   I'm not a big fan of taking a ton of stock market risk,
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.720]   especially if it's less than five years.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.240]   I think that's kind of my cutoff, I think.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.720]   And since you're saving this money over time periodically,
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.000]   dollar cost averaging in, you have a lower time horizon.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.560]   So John, do this next chart.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.520]   This is the win rate over one, two, three,
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.640]   four, and five-year periods.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.920]   You can still see it's pretty good.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.720]   We've talked about this for three or four years
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.160]   the stock market's up on a one-year basis.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.480]   It's a little over 80% of the time.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.460]   Two years, three years, it's like 85% of the time.
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.000]   Four years, 87, and we talked about five years, it's like 88.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.440]   So it's still pretty good win rates.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.560]   The odds are still in your favor.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.760]   I still think that there's just two types of risks
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.600]   in the market.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.760]   There's avoidable risks and there's unavoidable risks.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.400]   Volatility is an unavoidable risk.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.160]   Recessions is an unavoidable risk.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.680]   Bear markets, all these things, you can't avoid those.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.600]   Avoidable risks, I think just adding
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.160]   unnecessary levels of stress to your financial life.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.640]   So I do think the idea of maybe a target date or robo-advisor
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.280]   might make sense, because for those,
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.080]   you can determine your goals a little more.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.540]   It's a little more diversification.
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.960]   The Vanguard 2030 target date fund is $65.35.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.560]   2025 is more like $60.40.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.280]   So still a decent amount of stock risk.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.920]   John, one more chart here.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.640]   These are the yields for short-term treasuries
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.800]   right now.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.480]   I don't know why you want to overcomplicate things.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.600]   You can earn 4.5% to 5.5% from three-month T-bills
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.880]   to five-year treasuries.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.400]   I mean, could rates fall again?
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.000]   Sure, they could, especially for T-bills and high yield
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.160]   and short-term stuff.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.760]   That's a strong possibility in the coming years.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.800]   But you have the ability to lock in higher yields for longer
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.600]   now, the first time in, I don't know, 15, 20 years.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.320]   It's much higher.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.720]   So I have three rules when it comes
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.760]   to short-to-intermediate-term financial goals like this.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.480]   One, it has to be liquid.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.640]   Two, I'm not willing to accept much, if any, volatility.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.800]   And three, I don't want the possibility of large losses
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.680]   right when I need to spend it at the worst possible time,
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.360]   which can happen.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.280]   You could have a down 20% month in the stock market
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.780]   right when you need to spend the money,
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.440]   and then your plans are out the window.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.280]   So could you make more money investing
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.240]   in riskier securities?
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:00.880]   Sure.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.360]   But I think the downside of not having that money or the money
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.080]   that you need at that time outweighs
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.160]   the upside you could get.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.800]   So I say don't overthink this one.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.840]   Short-term bonds, cash, high-yield savings account,
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.480]   count yourself lucky that you weren't
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.000]   saving for this goal five years ago
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.200]   when yields were much, much lower.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.280]   It's way easier now to save for a goal like this,
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.960]   with yields being where they are.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.560]   Sure.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.520]   And talking about the market being difficult to predict,
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.240]   after the Nvidia earnings, why is the market down today?
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.240]   What's going on?
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.720]   Buy the rumors, sell the news.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.480]   Right?
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.920]   I don't get it.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.000]   If the market was my kid, I'd ground him.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.600]   Makes no sense.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.120]   That's the stock market, though, right?
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.360]   It's what was priced in, I guess.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.320]   I guess.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.040]   All right.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.360]   All right, up next, we have a question from Mike.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.840]   Big fan, haven't missed a single episode since you started,
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.480]   not to brag.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.240]   Wow, that's high praise.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.480]   Thank you.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.400]   I'm 53, with a secure career, and have $1.2 million
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.960]   invested across IRAs, Roth IRA, 401(k), and brokerage account.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:07.040]   I have no debt except a mortgage where my home has approximately
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.240]   $200,000 in equity, and I hold six months' expenses in cash
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.920]   and a high-yield savings account.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.640]   My goal is to retire age 60 or 62.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.120]   I'm told by all of the content pundits--
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.120]   I don't know if he's including you--
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.560]   that I'm way above average with my savings,
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.480]   but I stress every day that I'm not
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.820]   going to have enough money to retire a little early.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.400]   I don't purchase lavish items, no extravagant mudrooms for me.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.240]   Any advice for me on how to manage emotions
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.760]   through this journey?
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.560]   All right, two topics that are coming up
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.360]   more and more in our emails.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.980]   One is the early retirement thing,
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.200]   and two is the psychology behind spending money.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.440]   So let's bring in someone who's on the front lines,
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.720]   dealing with this on a daily basis.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.480]   Financial advisor with us at Riddles, Kevin Young.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.000]   Hey, Kevin.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.480]   Hey, guys.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.960]   Kevin, we get a lot of questions from people,
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.540]   what's the right asset allocation,
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.500]   where are interest rates going to go,
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.900]   when's the next recession, all these things.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.420]   I think the biggest one most people
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.500]   want to know when they come to a financial advisor
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.540]   is, am I going to be OK?
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.840]   And you can never give someone 100% certainty
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.300]   on that question, because we don't
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.100]   know what the future holds.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.680]   But that's the job of being a financial advisor
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.620]   in a lot of ways, is managing the emotions as much
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.740]   as managing the finances.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.900]   So how do you help people work through these things, where
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.180]   they're balancing the need to save and invest
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.720]   for the future with enjoying themselves now,
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.320]   and then dealing with those emotions?
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.740]   Because it is a real thing.
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.540]   We get these kind of questions all the time
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.540]   from people who know something psychologically
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.940]   is holding them back from enjoying
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.380]   the fruits of their labor.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.180]   Right.
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.740]   Yeah, and you're completely right.
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.580]   This is a really common question.
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.140]   When somebody reaches out to a financial advisor,
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.060]   I think it's more about this behavioral aspect
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.820]   of, I need to sleep at night, knowing
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.940]   that things are going to work out for me,
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.900]   regardless of maybe what happens in the markets.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.660]   And so for this question, to answer a question
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.260]   with a question is, well, how much are you spending?
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.540]   Like, if you're planning on spending $40,000 a month,
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.220]   you're not on track.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.300]   If you're on maybe $4,000 a month,
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.740]   you're perfectly on track.
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.340]   So a little bit of it depends on the spending habits
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.420]   that you're going to be envisioning yourself having
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.780]   in retirement, which that's another really good question,
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.140]   because I think a lot of people just imagine, OK, well,
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.820]   whatever I'm doing today, that's how much
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.580]   I'll spend in retirement.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.020]   I like to think about it that, if every day were Saturday,
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.860]   would I spend more money than I do now?
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.140]   And the answer is yes.
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.480]   I would go out to dinner.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.420]   I would play more golf.
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.220]   I would do whatever.
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.140]   I would do things that cost money.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.380]   And so you might want to think to yourself
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.300]   that whatever you're doing now, maybe plus 20%.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.020]   And then whatever that number is, sort of the rule of thumb--
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.100]   and I use that term very loosely in financial planning--
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.420]   is generally around a 4% rate of withdrawal
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.580]   is pretty acceptable.
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.100]   And so if you do that math and you're around 4% right now,
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.940]   I'd say you're back in the envelope.
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.620]   You're on track.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.580]   But our goal as financial advisors
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.980]   is to make sure that, if you are going out and spending
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.940]   that money, that you're actually enjoying spending it.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.300]   If you're going to Italy for a week
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.220]   and you're worried about every single dollar or euro
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.640]   that you spend, you're not really enjoying the money.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.660]   So you've got to kind of find that perfect middle ground
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.940]   where you feel comfortable in the plan,
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.860]   you're withdrawing at an OK rate,
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.540]   and that you're actually enjoying it.
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.040]   Right, the old Nick Murray quote is, if you're still worried,
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.300]   you're not really wealthy.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.760]   But let's say someone comes to you and says,
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.580]   I want to take this extravagant vacation for six weeks
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.680]   on the Amalfi Coast, or I want to buy a convertible
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.060]   because I'm having a 3/4 life crisis,
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.980]   or I want to buy a vacation home or whatever.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.900]   How do you help them work through the finances behind that
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.140]   and also the emotions of, like, here's your financial plan.
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.260]   Here's what you usually do.
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.020]   If we take this one big lump sum here,
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.060]   it's going to impact you.
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.580]   And yes, you're OK, or no, you're not OK.
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.100]   Yeah, so we talk a lot about just
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.900]   having a framework for decision making
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.220]   when it comes to this stuff.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.940]   So instead of saying, yeah, like, I'm looking at the numbers
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.420]   and you should be OK, like, that's not a great answer.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.700]   So we use a variety of types of software
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.220]   and just kind of our institutional knowledge here
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.340]   to understand, well, how would this impact it?
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.260]   And it might just be saying, well, normally, I
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.140]   spend $100,000 a year in retirement.
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.300]   If I bump that up to $130,000 this year,
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.820]   and then we rerun the projections,
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.140]   and if everything still looks good and makes sense,
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.060]   and the plan is still really strong,
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.420]   it gives us the ability to say to that person, yeah,
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.300]   go ahead and do this.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:38.420]   And it gives the client the feeling that, hey, like,
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.860]   this has been thought through.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.620]   It's not just Kevin, or Steve, or Sally,
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.980]   or whoever your financial advisor is saying, yeah,
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.940]   you're good, trust me, because that's not a great answer
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:48.620]   either.
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.780]   Yeah, and do you think that a lot of times
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.400]   they're looking for permission for you,
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.580]   or they're just looking for some reassurance that, OK,
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.540]   I was worried about this, and I want to do it,
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.340]   but I just don't know if I can?
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.380]   Yeah, that's definitely the case.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.980]   It's certainly not permission, but I
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.580]   think the reassurance part of it is big.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.380]   And I think, broadly, financial advisors
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:14.060]   would agree that one of the actually more challenging
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.660]   aspects of our job is getting people to spend money.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.300]   It's a hard psychological flip to switch,
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.580]   that I've been doing nothing but save, save, save, save, save
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.020]   every two weeks into my 401(k) for 35 or 40 years,
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.220]   and now you're telling me that I'm not going to make
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.180]   contributions anymore.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.900]   I'm just going to be taking money out.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.260]   And that can be a challenge psychologically.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.300]   So that's what I think we do, and financial advisors
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.900]   can help people manage that emotional aspect.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.140]   It's like Ben Graham said, more money, more problems.
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:48.660]   Up next, we have a question from--
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.460]   Hey, you gave me the drum chime on "Animal Spirits" this week.
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.780]   You deserve one for that, too.
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:55.940]   OK, I appreciate it.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.980]   No, that was funny.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.780]   That was good.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.200]   And Michael never gives you credit
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.780]   for your jokes on the show.
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.420]   You always make jokes, and Michael just steamrolls ahead.
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.620]   Never sells me.
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.340]   OK, up next, we have a question from Chris.
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.140]   Hi, Ben and Duncan.
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.460]   I have a question about what to do with the dividends
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.740]   from municipal bonds.
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.740]   For several years, I have bought shares
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.900]   on a quarterly basis of a municipal bond ETF
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.140]   from my state, New York, for the tax-free dividends.
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.260]   Does it make more sense to reinvest the dividends
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.460]   and buy more shares of the ETF or to allocate the dividends
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.500]   elsewhere, given owning more shares of the ETF
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.180]   will likely lead to a bigger capital gains tax bill
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.340]   if I sell the shares in the future?
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.500]   This reminds me of something I was pretty late to figuring out
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.260]   and thinking about that now seems obvious.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.100]   But when you have drip set up, it can mess up.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.980]   It can cause a wash sale whenever
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.020]   you get out of something, which I'd never really--
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.980]   I'd never thought of until I saw it actually happen in my account.
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.540]   I think the spending, getting out and selling or spending,
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.900]   is probably a big piece here.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.900]   But I think my inclination, unless you're
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.980]   using that income for living circumstances,
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.140]   is you reinvest the dividends automatically.
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.820]   No matter what, because when you're setting expectations
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.740]   for asset classes, especially for bonds,
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.860]   that's the biggest part of the return, is the income.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.180]   So if you're trying to keep things in balance asset
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.740]   class-wise, it makes sense to reinvest.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.180]   Is there another tax implication, Kevin,
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.420]   that I'm not considering here?
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.740]   What do you think?
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.940]   Well, it obviously depends on which way.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.620]   I'm assuming this person's buying a muni bond ETF.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.900]   Or even if it's just regular muni bonds, it's fine.
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.500]   But as you're reinvesting dividends into things,
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.500]   if the price of that ETF, or bond fund,
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.420]   or whatever it might be, is rising over that time period,
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.020]   you're buying in at higher costs.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.060]   So your average cost when you go to sell
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.820]   will actually be higher.
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:54.380]   Yeah, right.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.900]   You're not reinvesting at the original cost basis.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:57.460]   Exactly.
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:57.980]   Exactly.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.220]   So what I would maybe think about
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:06.620]   is you don't want to let the tax tail wag the portfolio dog.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.140]   So I wouldn't be thinking about capital gains
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:14.020]   on selling a municipal bond as sort
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.140]   of the thing that's going to drive the allocation decision.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.300]   And you're probably not going to have a huge capital
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.780]   gain there anyway in bonds.
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.580]   Probably not.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:27.580]   This is not a large growth tech ETF.
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.140]   It's probably going to be relatively slow and steady.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.700]   So the capital gains shouldn't be super significant.
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:35.660]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.300]   I mean, I had a call with Bill Sweden, a client this morning.
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.460]   He said the exact same thing.
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.260]   And he's a tax guy.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.380]   He said, if there's a hierarchy, investing comes first.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.620]   Tax is a part of it.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.740]   But that's where you kind of improve on the margins.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.620]   That's not like your first line of--
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.740]   because if it was all taxes, people
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.020]   would have all their money in municipal bonds.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.860]   And that's not ideal for most people either.
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.540]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.140]   Eventually, when you go to take money out
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.020]   of whether it's a bond ETF, or an individual bond,
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.940]   or a stock, or a stock fund, you're going to pay taxes.
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.180]   So that's part of this.
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.020]   And as Bill likes to remind us, when
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.500]   you're paying taxes on an investment, that means you won.
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.860]   It's not a bad thing.
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.320]   You want to shelve them as much as possible,
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.700]   but it means you won the game.
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.060]   It's better than the alternative of selling
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.780]   Oatly stock down 90%.
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.420]   Yep, exactly.
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.180]   Hey, that's tax-loss harvesting, you know?
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.220]   For years to come.
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.380]   Yeah, I'm going to be set.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.020]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:35.700]   One more.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.820]   You joked, but I think it did just hit a new all-time low.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.240]   I don't even need to look anymore.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.820]   I can just judge by the expression on your face
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.320]   every day.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.460]   Hey, my TQQQ is looking pretty good, though.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.140]   OK, last but not least, I'm lucky enough
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.540]   to work in the finance industry in Manhattan, which
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.820]   has allowed me to build up a good cushion of assets
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.460]   that I keep in a diversified portfolio and a brokerage
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.140]   account.
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.380]   However, when looking to buy a home,
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.380]   are you supposed to feel uneasy about liquidating
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.460]   a portion of this portfolio for a down payment?
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.500]   I understand that real estate becomes the largest
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.740]   portion of your overall wealth, but it still
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.380]   seems odd to tap into accumulated savings.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.540]   Another emotions-based question here.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.660]   It's bizarre, because the whole point of saving
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:17.820]   in the first place is that you're
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.020]   going to spend that money at some time in the future.
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.960]   But I think once you start seeing the numbers go up
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.020]   and reach different goalposts, you're kind of hoarding this,
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.260]   and you're wanting to let go of it less and less.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.180]   I know certain clients over the years have--
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:32.820]   it's funny.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.080]   Some people look at returns and say,
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.620]   if I don't hit this return, I'm going to be upset or whatever.
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.580]   Other people, it's like a line in the sand
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.300]   of big round numbers, right?
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.980]   If my portfolio is above $1 million, I'm happy.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.140]   If it's below $1 million, I'm not happy.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.340]   Not taking into account spending and all these different things
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.380]   that happen and markets fluctuating.
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.960]   But I think it is difficult to let go,
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.880]   even though doing this would be trading one financial asset
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.080]   for another, right?
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.060]   You're essentially rebalancing your personal balance sheet.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.180]   But how do you think through this stuff with people
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.740]   when it's, OK, this is a financial goal you've
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.460]   been thinking about and planning for.
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.420]   And at a certain point, you just have to let go and accept
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.340]   that this was the whole point of the goal in the first place.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.300]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:19.300]   I mean, if you're not emotional about a home purchase,
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.660]   you're not human.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.700]   So that's number one there.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.380]   It's not an easy decision, regardless
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.020]   of what's going on with rates or prices.
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.900]   And yeah, I think what you just said is perfect.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.620]   You probably started saving in this portfolio
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.140]   to achieve a goal.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.460]   And if the goal was, I'm going to use this money
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.100]   to buy a house, this portfolio is just a tool
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.380]   in order to achieve that goal.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.420]   The other thing I think about is,
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.620]   is the home purchase something that is the goal?
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.700]   Or is it just you feel like you should buy a house
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:57.540]   because that's what people do when they're growing up
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.500]   or becoming adults or whatever?
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.520]   If you don't need to and you feel better
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.300]   about your financial world being liquid and having
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.300]   this portfolio and continuing to pay rent, which right now it's
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:12.740]   not a bad deal, then that might be the right answer.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.860]   Especially in a high cost of living area like Manhattan,
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.180]   where it's going to be very expensive.
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.060]   I think the other thing is you can look at the portfolio value
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.540]   change in your brokerage account on a daily basis.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.000]   You don't really see that in your--
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.380]   you can go to Zillow if you want.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.340]   I guess most people don't think of it that same way as,
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.840]   here's the value of my home, and it's worth this much money.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.860]   Because whatever, it's a form of consumption.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:34.540]   But you're right.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.300]   I think a lot of people feel peer pressured
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.580]   because it's like, well, that's the next logical step.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.580]   You have to buy a house.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.540]   It's not for everyone.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.860]   Renting offers you way more flexibility.
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.860]   No, yeah, you don't have to buy a house just because you
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.860]   think you have to.
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.320]   But the other thing, if this was the whole point of saving
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.580]   in the first place, then that's what you want to do.
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.820]   And you're going to own this house, or this apartment,
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.500]   or condo, or whatever, for a long time,
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.460]   then you're thinking about it the right way.
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.860]   And that's just part of saving.
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:03.100]   That's how it works.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.260]   I think an underrated aspect of renting
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.240]   is the ability to be like, yeah, I
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.740]   don't really like this neighborhood.
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.500]   We'll just move next year.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.620]   If you move to a new neighborhood and buy a house,
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.540]   you're probably going to convince yourself
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.980]   that you love the neighborhood, even if you actually secretly
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:18.380]   hate it.
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.140]   Yeah, you're stuck.
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.940]   The flexibility is a huge thing for renting
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.580]   that doesn't come up very often.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.260]   If you're going to move for remote work or other career
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:25.940]   option--
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.140]   I think this is similar, though, to Kevin.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.140]   You probably get this, too, is some people
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.880]   get to the point of, I don't want to touch my principal.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.260]   I want to live off the income.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.300]   And they think if they touch their principal,
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.180]   then they are somehow taking two steps back,
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.060]   and that they're depleting.
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.360]   It's OK to spend your principal.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.020]   That's what you saved for.
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.140]   It's not going to be the end of the world
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.820]   if you spend a little bit of money
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.140]   and just live off something besides the income.
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.740]   Yeah, 100%.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.620]   I think the other thing to think about is you can--
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.540]   you might get a lot of joy opening your portfolio
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:02.900]   and seeing it up, or seeing, oh, great, we were up 2% today,
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.560]   or we're up 1% today, or I'm up 8% on the year.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.600]   You're not going to get that same emotional kick,
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.900]   like you said, pulling into the driveway of your house.
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.100]   There's not a ticker symbol floating above your house
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.220]   that tells you what it did that day.
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.440]   But there's a nice emotional component to that.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.980]   If you've got a family, like knowing
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.500]   you've put a roof over your family's head,
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.820]   knowing you've got a place to go,
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.700]   knowing the memories that are going to be made there,
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.160]   et cetera, you're not going to get that out of a portfolio.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.780]   Do people check the Zestimate regularly on their house,
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.280]   though?
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.780]   Is that kind of the closest you get?
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.300]   I would bet that people the last couple of years
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.060]   have checked their Zestimate way more
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.100]   than they would have in the previous three years.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.620]   Because it's moved more than it did before.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.860]   Yes, this is what happens when we get the middle age.
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.220]   You check Zillow all the time.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.340]   And if you don't check, they'll send you
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.700]   an email reminding you of it.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:44.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.860]   Wherever you are that's a new place,
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.620]   you're hopping on Zillow no matter what.
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.100]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.100]   But again, we've had questions today
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.220]   from all sorts of people who are very financially secure,
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.060]   or they have a high income, or they have a lot of money saved.
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.140]   And there's just some sort of emotional hurdle
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.920]   that's causing them to stop and think.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.140]   And I think it's just worth pointing out
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.740]   that sometimes this stuff sounds easier on paper
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.340]   than it is, because a lot of times
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.100]   there is no right or wrong answer, right?
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.020]   Buying a house could be the right answer here.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.060]   Or holding out and renting, and then
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.380]   saving the difference or whatever
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.460]   could be the right answer.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.500]   But either way, it could be the right answer,
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.820]   depending on how they feel in their circumstances.
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.820]   Yeah, there's a spreadsheet answer,
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.580]   and there's the personal answer, right?
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.580]   And just because it makes sense on a spreadsheet
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.860]   doesn't necessarily make sense for you as a person.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.420]   Bingo.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.220]   OK.
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.220]   Thanks to Kevin for joining us again.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.460]   We appreciate everyone.
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.380]   Great questions every week.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.100]   Every week I get a Google Doc sent to me of new questions.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.620]   And it seems like more and more questions every week.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.740]   They're always really good.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.660]   Or you can email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.420]   Leave us a comment or a review.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.340]   What else?
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.340]   This is the only time you'll ever see me wearing
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.140]   a hat on this show, probably.
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.780]   Duncan, you can have this one.
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.780]   We have Future Proof coming up very soon.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.780]   Looking forward to that.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.780]   Future Proof in a couple weeks.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.820]   Everyone come say hi if you're there.
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.200]   Kevin's going to be there as well.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.940]   Duncan, me.
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.460]   And we'll see you next week.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.500]   See you, everyone.
