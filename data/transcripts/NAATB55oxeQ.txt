[00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.360]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.960]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.980]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.720]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.840]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.000]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.840]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.560]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.120]   It is, however, part of my desire
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.240]   to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.480]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.280]   to the general public.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.800]   Along those lines, I want to thank today's sponsors
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.080]   of the podcast.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.420]   The first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.140]   Athletic Greens is a product that I've been using since 2012,
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.720]   long before I launched this podcast,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.320]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.320]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.160]   vitamin mineral probiotic supplement.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.500]   It's a greens drink that you mix with water.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.840]   I add lemon juice to mine because I like the way it tastes,
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.720]   and it gets you all the vitamins and minerals you need,
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.000]   as well as probiotics, and probiotics are important to me
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.160]   because there are a lot of data now showing
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.260]   that gut health is important for the gut-brain axis,
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.640]   things like mood, immunity, et cetera.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.200]   If you want to try Athletic Greens,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.080]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.240]   and if you do that, they'll send you a year's supply
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.520]   of liquid vitamin D3 and K2.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.580]   Vitamin D3, as many of you probably already know,
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.920]   has been shown to be important for various aspects
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.560]   of immune system function,
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.480]   as well as other biological pathways,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.600]   metabolic function, et cetera.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.640]   So once again, if you want to try Athletic Greens,
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.340]   you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.840]   and they will send you a year's supply of the D3, K2.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.400]   This podcast is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.600]   Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.060]   I've been meditating on and off since I was in my teens
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.320]   with more off than on,
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.780]   mainly because meditation can be hard to stick to.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.880]   Some people are very good
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.200]   at maintaining a meditation practice, others not so much.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.780]   I'm in the latter category.
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.380]   However, I find that when I have something
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.240]   to guide my meditation, such as Headspace,
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.480]   it makes it much easier for me to be consistent
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.480]   about my meditation practice.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.560]   There is now tons of data out there
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.120]   in quality peer-reviewed journals
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.120]   showing that meditative states can facilitate cognition,
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.200]   recovery of mental function,
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.120]   recovery of physical ability, et cetera.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.040]   So there are a lot of reasons to take up a meditation
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.640]   practice, Headspace, and the Headspace app makes it easy
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.600]   to learn and maintain a meditation practice.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.200]   If you want to try Headspace,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.120]   you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.100]   And if you do that, they will let you try Headspace
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.080]   for an entire month for free, so zero risk there.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.740]   That's headspace.com/specialoffer to try Headspace,
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.920]   the meditation app, for one month for free.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.520]   Today's podcast episode is about sleep
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.920]   and wakefulness.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.000]   We are going to discuss jet lag, shift work,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.460]   babies, kids, and the elderly.
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.680]   And we are going to discuss protocols
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.660]   that are backed by science.
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.840]   That means quality peer-reviewed papers published
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.200]   in excellent journals that can support particular tools
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.520]   that you can use to combat things like jet lag,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.960]   offset some of the negative effects of shift work,
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.000]   and make life easier for the new parent
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.580]   as well as for the newborn child, the adolescent,
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.180]   anyone that wants to sleep better,
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.120]   feel better when they're awake, et cetera.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.440]   If you've listened to the previous three episodes
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.040]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.640]   we've been exploring these themes of wakefulness
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.960]   and sleepiness, how to fall asleep, how to stay asleep.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.860]   And we've been discussing parameters like light,
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.500]   exercise, temperature, et cetera.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.260]   If you've had a chance to listen to those episodes, great.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.220]   Today's discussion will be even more digestible for you.
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.180]   If you haven't, that's okay.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.380]   I will provide a little bit of background here or there
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.420]   so that it's not necessary that you have listened
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.660]   to those previous episodes.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.180]   But if you get a chance to listen to them, please do it.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.580]   I think it will help you digest the information better.
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.940]   Let's just take a step back for a moment
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.460]   and remind everybody what we're talking about.
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.820]   We're talking about an endogenous,
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.820]   meaning within us, rhythm that we call the circadian rhythm.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.200]   The circadian rhythm is a 24 hour rhythm
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.300]   in all sorts of functions.
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.740]   The most prominent one is a rhythm
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.240]   in our feelings of wakefulness and sleepiness.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.860]   So believe it or not,
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.340]   the experiment has been done throughout history,
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.700]   not often, but it's been done where people will go down
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.820]   into a cave and will exist in constant darkness
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.520]   for some period of time.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.860]   There are also cases where people have been
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.340]   in constant light for some period of time.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.100]   But because people can close their eyes,
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.160]   it's actually easier to do the experiment
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.580]   where you're in constant darkness
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.280]   to address the question of what is the endogenous,
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.700]   meaning the internal rhythm that we all have.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.380]   And it turns out we all have this rhythm of about 24 hours,
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.140]   although it's not exactly 24 hours.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.300]   Meaning every 24 hours,
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.420]   your body temperature goes from low to high
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.000]   and back down to low again.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.060]   And it takes 24 hours for that to repeat.
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.620]   Not 18, not six, 24, plus or minus a couple hours.
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.820]   You also have a rhythm in sleepiness and wakefulness
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.760]   that correlates with that.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.240]   We tend to be sleepy as our temperature is falling,
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.240]   getting lower, and we tend to be more awake or waking
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.780]   when our temperature is increasing.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.380]   This is a biological fact.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.900]   It is right down to our DNA.
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.380]   We actually have genes in every single one of our cells
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.500]   that ensure that every cell is on this 24-hour-ish rhythm,
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.700]   close to 24 hours.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.140]   We have a clock over the roof of our mouth,
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.240]   a group of neurons called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.980]   That clock generates a 24-hour rhythm,
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.740]   and that clock is entrained,
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.920]   meaning it is matched to the external light-dark cycle,
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.100]   which is, no surprise, 24 hours.
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.500]   Spinning the Earth takes 24 hours.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.500]   So our cells, our organs, our wakefulness, our temperature,
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.700]   but also our metabolism, our immune system, our mood,
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.580]   all of that is tethered to the outside light-dark cycle.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.000]   And if we are living our life in a perfect way
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.260]   where we wake up in the morning
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.620]   and we view sunlight as it crosses the horizon,
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.300]   and then by evening, we catch a little sunlight,
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.980]   and then at night, we're in complete darkness,
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.180]   we will be more or less perfectly matched
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.840]   to the external or ambient light-dark cycle.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.780]   Very few of us do that
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.740]   because of these things that we call artificial lights
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.060]   and this other thing that we call life demands.
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.180]   So today we're going to talk about
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.020]   when we get pulled away from that rhythm.
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.260]   Now, you may immediately be thinking,
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.100]   well, I've heard there are night owls
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.740]   and there are morning larks, they're sometimes called,
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.540]   and there are genetic polymorphisms,
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.020]   that's just a fancy name for genetic variations
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.560]   that make some people want to wake up early
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.840]   and other people want to stay up late
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.440]   and teens want to sleep in more.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.340]   Sure, that's all true.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.780]   That's all true regardless of what names we give those.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.580]   However, there's no escaping the fact
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.140]   that human beings are a diurnal species.
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.680]   We were designed, literally,
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.780]   our cells and the circuits of our body
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.220]   were constructed to be awake during the daytime
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.560]   and asleep at night.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.580]   How do I know that?
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.140]   Well, I wasn't consulted at the design phase,
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.980]   but I'm certain of that because many studies have shown
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.300]   that when we deviate too far from a diurnal schedule
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.700]   and we try and become nocturnal, we can pull it off,
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.380]   but serious health effects,
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.220]   both mental and physical, start to arise.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.020]   I'm not going to spend much of today
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.180]   talking about all the negative effects of jet lag.
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.940]   I'll talk a little bit about it,
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.580]   or the negative effects of shift work,
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.600]   or trying to scare you by telling you
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   about the quite valid data around depression,
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.940]   amnesia, dementia, all the terrible things that happen
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.020]   when you're not sleeping well.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.840]   Rather, I'd like to focus on what you can do
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.620]   and arm you with tools.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.800]   So let's talk about that perfect schedule for a moment,
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.520]   and then let's talk about jet lag
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.160]   and what jet lag really represents
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.160]   and how to push back on jet lag, shift your clock faster,
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.520]   and escape some of the severe bad things
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.880]   that can happen with jet lag,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.660]   including just feeling miserable
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.840]   when you're traveling for work or vacation.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.020]   So what is the perfect day?
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.080]   What does that look like
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.300]   from a circadian sleep wakefulness standpoint?
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.940]   I'm about to summarize what I've said
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.740]   in the three previous podcast episodes,
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.580]   as well as now countless Instagram posts.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.180]   Here's the deal.
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.180]   You basically want to get as much light, ideally sunlight,
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.060]   but as much light into your eyes
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.320]   during the period of each 24-hour cycle
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.780]   when you want to be awake, when you want to be alert.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.400]   And you want to get as little light into your eyes
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.040]   at the times of that 24-hour cycle
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.900]   when you want to be asleep or drowsy and falling asleep.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.160]   How much is enough?
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.640]   Well, you don't want to go so high with the light exposure
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.640]   that you damage your eyes,
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.040]   because as many of you have heard me say before,
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.420]   the eyes are actually two pieces of your brain,
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.340]   your central nervous system
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.080]   that were extruded out of your skull.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.900]   And as pieces of the central nervous system,
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.260]   AKA your brain, they will not regenerate.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.180]   At least right now, the technologies don't exist
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.600]   to regenerate those neurons in humans.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.400]   You do not want to damage them.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.780]   So what is too bright?
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.360]   Well, when it's painful to look at.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.720]   When you have to blink or close your eyes
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.560]   in order to bear it.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.720]   So please don't look at very bright lights,
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.440]   so painful that they're likely going to damage your eyes.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.480]   However, if you get up in the morning
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.960]   and it's still dark out and you want to be awake,
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.320]   you would be wise to turn on artificial lights,
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.560]   in particular overhead lights
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.080]   for reasons I've discussed previously,
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.880]   but those overhead lights will optimally trigger the neurons,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.540]   these melanopsin cells in the retina
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.180]   that will activate your circadian clock.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.800]   When the sun comes out, even if there's cloud cover,
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.040]   the sun does come out every day,
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.440]   regardless of where you live, unless you live in a cave.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.280]   People have said to me,
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.440]   "Well, I live in an area where I can't really see the sun."
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.160]   Well, the sun is there.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.080]   It might be hiding behind clouds
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.060]   unless it's very, very dark where you live,
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.000]   like Scandinavia in the depths of winter,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.220]   which case you might want some artificial light.
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.000]   Get some sunlight in your eyes when you can.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.920]   Here's the deal with sunlight and artificial light
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.780]   that I have not discussed previously.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.960]   A lot of photon energy, a high amount of lux,
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.280]   L-U-X, comes through even cloud cover.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.400]   A good number to shoot for as a rule of thumb
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.560]   is to try and get exposure to at least 100,000 lux
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.420]   before 9 a.m., 10 a.m. maybe, but before 9 a.m.,
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:19.320]   assuming you're waking up sometime between 5 and 8 a.m.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.340]   So get 100,000 lux.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.080]   Now you do not, I want to repeat,
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.940]   you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.540]   or a 100,000 lux light.
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.780]   It's very, very bright.
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.000]   The mechanism of circadian clock setting,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.780]   and this is very important,
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.780]   the mechanism of circadian clock setting
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.240]   involves these neurons in your eye
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.680]   that send electrical signals
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.120]   to this clock above the roof of your mouth,
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.960]   and that system sums, meaning it adds photons.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.760]   It's a very slow system.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.740]   So let's say that I wake up
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.660]   and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.800]   That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.560]   If I were to look at that for a full minute,
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.800]   I would get that photon energy
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.820]   transferred into electrical energy of neurons
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.920]   and it would be communicated to my circadian clock.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.920]   However, the signal that it's morning
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.340]   will not have registered with the circadian clock
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:17.000]   unless I looked at that for 100 minutes or more.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.880]   So 100,000.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.880]   Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock,
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.740]   you're not going to get enough light from artificial light
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.000]   before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.920]   So you have this opportunity before 9 a.m., maybe 10 a.m.,
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.080]   to capture enough photons
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.880]   and you have to do it with your eyes.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.400]   I've discussed why that's important
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.000]   in previous episodes of the podcast,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.320]   but you have to do it with your eyes.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.520]   There is no extraocular photoreception.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.240]   This is not about vitamin D in your skin.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.400]   This is about setting your circadian clock,
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.760]   which is paramount for mental and physical health.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.200]   So here we're talking about trying to get that
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.680]   at least 100,000 photons, but not all at once,
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.300]   but you got to get them before 9 a.m. ish, maybe 10 a.m.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.140]   So what do you do?
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.260]   You go outside.
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.200]   If you want to get nerdy about this, quantitative,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.780]   you could download a free app like Light Meter
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.260]   and take a look around your house with Light Meter
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.840]   and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.200]   are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.360]   It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.800]   with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.000]   and tell your brain and body that it's morning.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.500]   Going outside, even on a cloudy day,
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.480]   could be 7,000, 10,000 lux.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.020]   It's really remarkable how bright it is,
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.960]   meaning how much photon energy is coming through.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.840]   So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9 a.m.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.640]   Now, if you can't do that because you live
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.380]   in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough,
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.860]   some people have sent me pictures from Northern England,
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.940]   it's just not bright enough in winter,
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.840]   then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.360]   in order to get enough photons.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.800]   And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.620]   to get each day before 9 a.m.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.400]   You can, in theory, get it all from artificial lights,
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.460]   but there are some special qualities about sunlight
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.640]   that make sunlight the better stimulus.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.700]   First of all, it's free if it's available outside.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.920]   There is a number of different, there are, excuse me,
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.120]   a number of different technologies,
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.240]   kind of like this one, like a light pad,
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.840]   that this one says it's a 930 lux.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.520]   I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.820]   to promote any specific products.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.760]   I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.000]   They're not a sponsor.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.520]   And it lets you toggle the brightness,
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.420]   I think, by holding this on, holding down this button,
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.760]   you can make it dimmer or brighter.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.940]   This is about 1,000 lux.
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.200]   It seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.060]   will have five times more photon energy coming through.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.820]   So some people set these lights or ring lights
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.480]   that they use for selfies and that kind of thing
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.680]   near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning,
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.880]   but you really want to get sunlight, okay?
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.800]   So those things are kind of nice 'cause they'll travel
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   and we're going to talk about jet lag,
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.280]   but I can't emphasize this enough.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.440]   That light has to be captured and summed
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.320]   before you enter the circadian dead zone,
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.840]   which is the middle of the day.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:05.460]   This is, again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.100]   Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature,
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.960]   that you look at sunlight sometime around the time
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.280]   when the sun is setting, and the reason for that, of course,
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.180]   is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes,
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.700]   because here's the diabolical thing.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.860]   While we need a lot of photon energy early in the day
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.000]   to wake up our system and set our circadian clock
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.600]   and prepare us for a good night's sleep,
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.000]   14 to 16 hours later, it takes very little photon energy
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.080]   to reset and shift our clock after 8 p.m.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.920]   And that's why you want to, as much as you safely can,
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.520]   avoid bright light and even not so bright light
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.320]   between the hours of 10 or 11 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.120]   A number of people have asked me some questions about this.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.120]   In the last episode, I went into red lights,
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.700]   I went and discussed blue blockers, all that kind of stuff,
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.280]   so I'm not going to repeat all that.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.400]   But here's the thing, if you see afternoon light,
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.520]   you're going to adjust down the sensitivity of your eyes
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.960]   so that you have a little bit more wiggle room,
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.780]   a little bit more leeway to view lights from screens
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.280]   and overhead lights even late at night
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.760]   without disrupting your circadian clock.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.840]   But it is a kind of a double-edged sword
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.000]   where you need a lot of light early in the day
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.560]   and you need to avoid bright lights later in the day.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.700]   I've mentioned studies on here.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.120]   A number of you have asked about getting the references.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.580]   We are in the process of trying to get a webpage going
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.420]   with full links.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.880]   There's some copyright issues that we have to deal with,
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.500]   but wherever possible, I'll try and reference these studies.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.240]   And when people ask, I'll generally put them
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.760]   in the response to their comments on YouTube or Instagram.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.580]   There have been two studies done
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.720]   from the University of Colorado,
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.500]   both published in Current Biology.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.000]   You can easily find these online
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.120]   by just googling the words current biology, camping,
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.200]   and reset circadian clocks that have shown
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.920]   that two days of waking up with the sun
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.440]   and avoiding light at night,
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.380]   they actually took graduate students camping,
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.080]   really cool experiment to be a part of,
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.320]   reset the melatonin and cortisol rhythms
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.000]   for these people that had otherwise drifted quite far
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.360]   from their natural rhythms.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.220]   There are other things that you can do to shift your clock
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.440]   and to reinforce your clock,
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.160]   like exercising more or less the same time,
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.200]   eating more or less the same time, et cetera.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.640]   That's not what today's episode is about.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.000]   So I just described perfect schedule,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.420]   get at least 100,000 lux of light exposure to the eyes,
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.480]   not all at once, but summing across the morning.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.680]   Again, you know when it's too much
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.240]   because it's painful to look at.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.080]   So that's obviously something to avoid.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.040]   But then once the middle of the day,
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.500]   let's say you're waking up at 10 or 11,
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.220]   you go outside, the sun's overhead, forget it.
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.760]   You're not going to shift your clock.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.160]   You're just not.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.400]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.320]   In the evening, you see the evening light
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.680]   and you want to get that light
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.640]   to adjust down your retinal sensitivity
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.600]   to afford you a bit of a buffer
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.800]   so that late at night,
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.920]   if you happen to look at screens
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.180]   or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night,
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.160]   it's not going to shift your clock
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.160]   because it takes probably only about 1,000 to 1,500 lux
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.120]   of light energy to shift your clock
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.080]   in the middle of the night.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.560]   So let's talk about shifting clocks
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.500]   because for the jet lag person,
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.780]   this ability to shift the clock
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.240]   with light temperature, exercise, and food
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.980]   is vitally important for getting onto the new local schedule.
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.600]   And there's so much out there about jet lag.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.880]   Today, I'm going to dial it down
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.960]   to one very specific parameter
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.260]   that all of you can figure out
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.000]   without any technology or devices
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.780]   and can apply for when you travel for work
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.840]   or pleasure or anytime you're jet lagged.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.420]   And I want to absolutely emphasize
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.820]   that you don't have to travel to get jet lagged.
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.760]   Many of you are jet lagged.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.360]   You're jet lagged because you're looking at your phone
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.320]   in the middle of the night.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.160]   You're jet lagged
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.340]   because you're waking up at different times a day.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.840]   You're jet lagged because your exercise
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.100]   is on a chaotic regime.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.640]   Some days at this time, some days at that time.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.740]   And if that works for you, great.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.900]   I want to be really clear
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.420]   that a number of people always say,
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.440]   "Well, I know so-and-so that you only needed four hours
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.200]   of sleep or they're just fine.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.040]   They traveled to Europe and it's just fine."
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.600]   There's a lot of individual variability.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.880]   And we're going to talk about the origins
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.260]   of some of that variability.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.000]   I mean, I know people that can eat anything
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.980]   and somehow seem to maintain great lipid profiles
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.980]   and body weight and fitness activities
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.880]   and I know some people that they eat one cracker
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.080]   and they sort of dissolve into a puddle of kind of tears
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.960]   because they think that that's going to throw them off
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.800]   and then maybe it does, I don't know.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.740]   There's a tremendous amount of variability out there.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:49.740]   So this is really about optimal and what's possible.
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.400]   And you have to ask,
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.120]   I can just say from personal experience,
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.140]   I suffer terribly from jet lag
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.880]   traveling in certain directions, but not others.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.720]   Some people don't have trouble with jet lag.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.140]   Many people will travel to a new location.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.800]   They feel great for the first day and night
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.100]   and then they crash and they have trouble sleeping
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.420]   or they travel back and they have a terrible time
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.320]   getting back onto a normal schedule.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.720]   And some of this varies with age
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.880]   and some of it varies with genetics.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.480]   And there is no simple pill or anything that you can take
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.420]   to just get rid of jet lag.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.260]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.080]   If it worked that way, I would tell you.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.580]   But there are some simple things that you can do.
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.940]   I'm going to arm you with the knowledge of what jet lag is
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.420]   and how it works.
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.020]   And contrary to what many people out there say and believe,
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.100]   I know that understanding mechanism
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.940]   affords you more flexibility.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.380]   Why understand mechanism as just opposed to me
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.740]   just writing up a PDF and giving you a list of things to do?
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.820]   Well, what happens when you can't do those things
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.260]   in exactly the way they're written down?
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.860]   When you understand mechanism,
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.900]   you understand how to control the machine
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.300]   that is your biological system, your nervous system.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.260]   So a little bit of understanding about mechanism
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.840]   goes a really long way.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.680]   So that's where we're headed.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.880]   Let's talk about what jet lag is.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.420]   Okay, well, I promised that I wouldn't get too dark
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.100]   with all the terrible things that can happen with jet lag,
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.840]   but I'm about to get dark.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.060]   There are quality peer-reviewed papers
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.860]   showing that jet lag will shorten your life.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.460]   It will kill you earlier.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.400]   I guess it means you'll die earlier.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.060]   It doesn't actually kill you necessarily,
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.060]   although there are many cases
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.500]   where tourists end up stepping in front of buses,
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.040]   especially in countries where the cars and buses
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.500]   drive on the opposite side of the street
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.100]   that they're used to,
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.980]   who are jet lagged and lose their life that way.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.680]   Jet lag is a serious thing.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.580]   Sure, we had a family story about this.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.060]   When I was growing up,
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:47.580]   I had a family member travel overseas for work
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.260]   and take a sleeping pill.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.980]   I won't name the sleeping pill,
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.180]   though at the end I'm going to talk about sleeping pills,
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.200]   and had a case of total amnesia for a week.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.420]   That's not entirely uncommon.
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.960]   If you've ever been really jet lagged and fallen asleep,
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.780]   doesn't even have to be in the middle of the day,
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.480]   woken up, you might not know where you are.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.480]   And that's because time and space are really linked
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.860]   and the brain wasn't designed to be transported
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.520]   four, five, six hours into a new time zone.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.160]   It just wasn't.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.480]   Our brain and the biological mechanisms
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.560]   that govern circadian timing
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.040]   were designed to be shifted by a couple hours,
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.240]   not necessarily six or nine or 12 hours.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.800]   So you really mess yourself up.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.720]   I've had that experience.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.440]   I usually experience it as fluctuations in mood.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.920]   I flew 12 hours out of phase to Abu Dhabi once
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.920]   to give a talk at NYU Abu Dhabi, and it was a mess.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.820]   I actually was getting vertigo.
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.680]   I wasn't hallucinating, but I was really out of it.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.320]   And my mood was just all over the place.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.060]   It was very bizarre.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.640]   Jet lag, even if you don't experience it
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:56.080]   as mood shifts or amnesia, it can shorten your life.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.160]   Now here's what's interesting.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:03.160]   Traveling westward on the globe is always easier
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.420]   than traveling eastward, okay?
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:13.420]   It's interesting because the effects of jet lag on longevity
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.040]   have shown that traveling east
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.740]   takes more years off your life than traveling west.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.540]   Now, of course, traveling 30 minutes
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.540]   into a new time zone or three hours,
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.360]   just one time zone over, or two time zones over, rather,
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:34.220]   is far less detrimental to your biology and psychology
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.580]   than a eight-hour shift or a nine-hour shift.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.280]   Now, here's what's interesting.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.020]   When we think about the effects of jet lag on longevity
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.240]   or this idea that it can shorten our lives,
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.020]   we have to ask ourselves, why?
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.060]   Why is that?
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.340]   And it turns out there's a pretty simple explanation
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.780]   for this.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.980]   We've talked before about the autonomic nervous system,
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.200]   this set of neurons in our spinal cord and body and brain
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.700]   that regulate our wakefulness and our sleepiness.
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:08.420]   Turns out that human beings, and probably most species,
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.080]   are better able to activate and stay alert
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.080]   than they are to shut down their nervous system
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.460]   and go to sleep on demand.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.580]   So if you really have to push
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.300]   and you really have to stay awake, you can do it.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.020]   You can stay up later.
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.720]   But falling asleep earlier is harder.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.300]   And that's why traveling East
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.520]   has a number of different features associated with it
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.640]   that because you're traveling East,
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.420]   you're trying to go to bed earlier.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.320]   As a Californian, if I go to New York City,
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.900]   I've got to get to bed three hours early
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.100]   and wake up three hours early,
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.540]   much harder than coming back to California
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.500]   and just staying up a few more hours.
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:49.500]   And this probably has roots in evolutionary adaptation
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.820]   under conditions where we need to suddenly gather up and go
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.220]   or forage for food or fight
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.600]   or do any number of different things
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.920]   that we can push ourselves through the release of adrenaline
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.440]   and epinephrine to stay awake,
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.260]   whereas being able to slow down
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.660]   and deliberately fall asleep
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.640]   is actually much harder to do.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.860]   So there's an asymmetry to our autonomic nervous system
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.280]   that plays out in the asymmetry of jet lag.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.360]   So if you want to read up on this,
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.520]   because people have asked me about papers,
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.400]   you can look, there's a paper published
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.360]   by Davidson and colleagues, 2006, in Current Biology
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.820]   that talks about the differences in lifespan
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:30.820]   for frequent Eastward versus Westward versus no travel
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.080]   and longevity and et cetera,
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.460]   a number of different biological markers of longevity.
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.840]   So going East is harder
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.700]   because going to sleep earlier is harder
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.160]   if you're trying to do that on demand.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.780]   Many people have turned to melatonin
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.120]   as a way to try and induce sleepiness.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.140]   I'm going to talk about melatonin at the end.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.980]   I've mentioned on previous podcasts,
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.000]   a number of you have asked for the evidence
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.920]   that melatonin is potentially detrimental
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.500]   to some hormone systems.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.520]   Melatonin is a hormone, and I'll discuss that at the end,
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.100]   in particular, the role of melatonin
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.200]   in suppressing a hormone pathway
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.080]   that involves luteinizing hormone,
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.640]   testosterone in men and estrogen in females,
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.140]   as well as a really interesting peptide
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.680]   called kisspeptin, that's a cool name.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.040]   All right, well, let's think about travel and what happens.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.600]   Let's say you're not going Eastward or Westward,
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.680]   but you're going North or South.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.200]   So if you go from, for instance,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.680]   Washington, DC to Santiago, Chile,
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:34.640]   or you go from Tel Aviv, Israel to Cape Town, South Africa,
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.000]   you're just going North and South, right?
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.360]   And not, you know, either direction.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.800]   You're not really moving into a different time zone.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.780]   You're not shifting.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.000]   So you will experience travel fatigue.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.920]   And it turns out that jet lag has two elements,
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.960]   travel fatigue and time zone jet lag.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:57.640]   Time zone jet lag is simply the inability
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.160]   of local sunlight and local darkness
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.620]   to match to your internal rhythm,
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.480]   this endogenous rhythm that you have.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.300]   So before we get too complicated
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.780]   and too down in the weeds about this,
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.080]   I want to just throw out a couple of important things.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.780]   First of all, I mentioned this earlier,
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.960]   but some people suffer from jet lag a lot.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.000]   Other people, not so much.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.240]   Most people experience worse jet lag as they get older.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.880]   There are reasons for that because early in life,
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.360]   patterns of melatonin release are very stable and flat
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.400]   and very high actually in children.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.960]   It's one of the reasons why they don't undergo puberty.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.640]   Then it becomes cyclic during puberty,
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.560]   meaning it comes on once every 24 hours
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.200]   and turns off once every 24 hours, it's cycles, cyclic.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.500]   And then as we get older, the cycles get more disrupted
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.340]   and we become more vulnerable to even small changes
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.600]   in schedule, et cetera, meal times, right?
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.440]   So jet lag gets worse as we age.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.440]   In addition, there are other things that happen with age
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.780]   that people start doing less exercise,
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.280]   their digestion can get worse, et cetera.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.520]   So some of the effects of age might not be direct effects
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.560]   of getting older, but some of the things
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.280]   that are correlated with being older,
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.000]   like people who are willing to have a regular exercise
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.780]   regime can use that exercise regime
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.620]   to shift their circadian clock.
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:24.360]   And I have a good friend, his father's in his 80s.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.360]   He's still pushing out 25, 30 pushups each morning.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.600]   He's on the Peloton or whatever it is,
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.440]   doing a lot of cycling.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.080]   So some 80 year olds are doing that, many are not.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.240]   Not many 30 year olds are not.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.320]   But if you have a regular exercise program,
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.120]   that's going to make it easier to shift your circadian clock
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.900]   for sake of jet lag.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.780]   And it's actually a knob you can turn
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.220]   and you can leverage for shifting your clock.
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.360]   Before we go any further,
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:57.360]   I want to make changing your internal rhythm really easy,
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.120]   or at least as easy and as simple
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.960]   as one could possibly make it, I believe.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.840]   What I want to talk about is perhaps one of the most
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.520]   important things to know about your body and brain,
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.920]   which is called your temperature minimum.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.860]   Most of you know your approximate weight.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.140]   Some of you even know your blood pressure.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.520]   Some of you might even know your body mass index.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.620]   Some of you might know other things about your biology
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.360]   that have fancy names,
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.920]   but everyone should know their temperature minimum.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.960]   Your temperature minimum doesn't require a thermometer
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.360]   to measure, although you could measure it.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.900]   Your temperature minimum is the point in every 24 hour cycle
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.500]   when your temperature is lowest.
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.960]   Now, how do you measure that without a thermometer?
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.340]   It tends to fall 90 minutes to two hours
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.000]   before your average waking time.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.840]   So I want to repeat that.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.300]   Your temperature minimum tends to fall 90 minutes
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.020]   to two hours before your average waking time.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.320]   So let's say you're not traveling
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.940]   and your typical wake up time is 5.30 AM.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:04.900]   Your temperature minimum is very likely 3.30 AM or 4.00 AM.
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.720]   If you want, if any of you want to,
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.260]   you can measure your temperature minimum.
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.160]   You can get a thermometer
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.900]   and you can measure your temperature every couple hours
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.720]   for 24 hours and you can find your temperature minimum.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.960]   What you're going to find is that you have a low point,
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.240]   the temperature minimum,
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.880]   and then your temperature will start to rise.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.660]   You'll wake up about two hours later.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.500]   Then your temperature will continue to rise
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.340]   into the afternoon.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.760]   It will peak, maybe a little trough, sometimes that happens.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:33.180]   And then it'll start declining slowly
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.440]   as you approach nighttime.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.280]   There are things that will disrupt that temperature pattern,
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.840]   saunas, cold baths, intense exercise, et cetera.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.760]   Meals tend to have a thermogenic effect
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.000]   that increases temperature slightly, little blips,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.260]   but the overall cycle,
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:52.040]   24 hour cycle of temperature has this pattern.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.240]   And last time I talked about the seminal work
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.540]   of Joe Takahashi and others who have shown
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.900]   that temperature actually is the signal
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.860]   by which this clock above the roof of your mouth
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.380]   in trains or collectively pushes all the cells
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.700]   and tissues of our body to be on the same schedule.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.540]   Temperature is the effector.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.580]   And once you hear that, there should be an immediate,
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.820]   oh, of course, because how else would you get
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.220]   all these different diverse cell types
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.980]   to follow one pattern, right?
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.200]   A pancreatic cell does something very different
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.940]   than a spleen cell or a neuron, right?
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:30.300]   They're all doing different things at different rates.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:31.840]   So the temperature signal can go out
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.340]   and then each one of those can interpret
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.360]   the temperature signal as one unified
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.800]   and consistent theme of their environment.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.360]   So temperatures vary from person to person.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.960]   Some people are 98.6.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.480]   Some people run a little colder, et cetera,
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.760]   but you have a low point and you have a high point.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.120]   Know your temperature minimum.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.740]   How are you going to figure out this temperature minimum?
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.280]   The temperature minimum can be determined
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.620]   by taking the last three to five wake-up times.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:03.620]   So let's say you wake up 7 a.m., 8 a.m., 3 a.m., happens.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.060]   Take those, add them together,
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.820]   average them by adding them up
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.020]   and dividing by the number of days.
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.000]   That'll give you the average.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.980]   If you're one of these people that wakes up at 3 a.m.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.900]   and then goes back to sleep and sleeps till 10,
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.180]   your wake-up time was 10 a.m.
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.780]   If you use an alarm clock, your wake-up time
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.180]   is still when you get up, okay?
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.920]   I know alarm clocks have been kind of demonized,
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.680]   but in my world, being late and missing appointments
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.720]   is also demonized, so I use an alarm clock.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:38.560]   Many people will wake up at exactly the same time each day.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.080]   There tends to be some variation for people.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.560]   Some people, it's going to vary
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.800]   depending on life circumstances,
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.340]   but average that for three to seven days or so.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.420]   Take that wake-up time.
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.340]   You can then get an average
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.580]   or sort of typical temperature minimum.
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.620]   Okay, so now you know how to get your temperature minimum.
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:33:00.620]   Your temperature minimum is your absolute reference point
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.700]   for shifting your circadian clock,
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.380]   whether or not it's for jet lag or shift work
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.980]   or some other purpose.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:07.960]   Here's the deal.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:15.020]   If you expose your eyes to bright light in the four hours,
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.540]   maybe five or six, but in the four hours
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.260]   after your temperature minimum,
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:25.500]   your circadian clock will shift
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.900]   so that you will tend to get up earlier
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.900]   and go to sleep earlier in the subsequent days, okay?
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.980]   It's what's called a phase advance,
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.900]   if you'd like to read up on this further.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.000]   You advance your clock, okay?
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.620]   However, if you view bright light
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.940]   in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum,
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:50.020]   you will tend to phase delay your clock.
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:54.540]   You will tend to wake up later and go to sleep later, okay?
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.360]   I'm going to repeat this
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.860]   because there's so much confusion out there
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.820]   and people talk about circadian time and all this.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.200]   Find your temperature minimum.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.860]   I tend to wake up at about 6 a.m.,
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.620]   sometimes 6.30, sometimes seven.
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.740]   It depends a lot on what I was doing the night before
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.220]   as I'm guessing it does for you,
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.180]   but that means that my temperature minimum
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.180]   is probably somewhere right around 4.30 a.m.,
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.660]   which means that if I wake up at 4.30 a.m.
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:21.980]   and I were to view bright light at 4.35 a.m.,
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.400]   I'm going to advance my clock.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.100]   I'm going to want to go to bed earlier the subsequent night
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.300]   and wake up earlier the subsequent morning.
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.900]   And as I shift my wake up time,
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.020]   my temperature minimum shifts too, right?
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.220]   Because each time we shift our wake up time,
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.920]   our temperature minimum shifts,
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.680]   assuming that wake up time shifts
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.880]   more than 30 minutes or an hour, okay?
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.880]   If I were to view bright light
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:53.060]   in the four to six hours before 4.30 a.m., guess what?
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.420]   The next night I'm going to want to stay up later
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.420]   and I'm going to want to wake up later the subsequent morning
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.800]   Your temperature minimum is a reference point,
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.940]   not a temperature reading.
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.520]   Again, if you want to measure your temperature minimum
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.580]   and figure out what it is,
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.680]   98 point whatever or 96 point whatever, that's fine.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.240]   You can do that, but that information won't help you.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.940]   What you need to know is what time
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.240]   your body temperature is lowest
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.880]   and understand that in the four hours or so
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.780]   just after that time, viewing light will advance your clock
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.540]   to make you want to get up earlier.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:29.060]   And the four hours before your temperature minimum,
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:33.460]   viewing light will make you want to stay up later.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.580]   Now, some people might be saying,
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.820]   well, I wake up early and I want to stay up late
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.560]   and I'm sleepy all day and I'm a mess or I feel fine.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.940]   Look, let's talk about feeling fine.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.820]   It turns out the definition of insomnia
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:49.080]   is when you're experiencing excessive sleepiness
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.920]   during the day.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.700]   Sleepiness and fatigue are different, okay?
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.420]   So in the world of sleep medicine,
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.060]   fatigue is a physical exhaustion.
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.660]   Sleepiness is falling asleep,
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.640]   like falling asleep at your desk
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.000]   or falling asleep during lectures
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.460]   or there seems to be something special about my lectures
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.580]   that makes people want to fall asleep.
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:09.460]   So if this cures your insomnia, fantastic.
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:14.460]   However, in all seriousness, sleepiness during the daytime,
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.280]   unless it's around your temperature peak
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.840]   and only lasts about 90 minutes or so,
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.100]   is a sign of insomnia.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.640]   It's a sign of lack of sleep.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:28.360]   I want to be very, very clear
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.600]   that if you know your temperature minimum,
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.120]   you can shift your clock using light.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:38.360]   You can also shift your clock by engaging in exercise
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.320]   in the four hours after your temperature minimum
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.120]   to wake up earlier on subsequent nights
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.400]   or exercise before then to delay your clock, okay?
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.880]   So now you can start to see and understand
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.360]   the logic of this system.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.040]   And we'll talk about why this works
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.240]   and the underlying biology,
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:58.160]   but understanding that temperature is the effector
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.760]   and understanding that you have this low point
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.580]   that reflects your most sleepy point, essentially,
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.400]   right before waking up.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.520]   And then temperature rises,
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.480]   you can now start to shift that temperature
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.200]   according to your travel needs.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.680]   Here's one way in which you might do that.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.800]   Let's say I am going to travel to Europe,
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.940]   which is nine hours ahead, typically, from California.
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:24.480]   I would want to determine my temperature minimum,
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.600]   which for me is about 4.30 AM, maybe 5 AM.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.600]   And I would want to start getting up at about 5.30 AM
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.120]   and getting some bright light exposure,
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.600]   presumably from artificial sources
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.220]   because the sunlight isn't going to be out at that time,
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.640]   maybe even exercising as well,
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.200]   maybe even eating a meal at that time
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.080]   if that's in your practice.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.720]   You would want to start doing that
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.480]   two or three days before travel.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:58.000]   Because once you land in, or I land in Europe,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.640]   chances are just viewing the sunrise or sunset in Europe
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.420]   is not going to allow me to shift my circadian clock.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.560]   Some people say get sunlight in your eyes when you land,
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.760]   but that's not going to work
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.040]   because one of two things is likely to happen.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.440]   With a nine hour shift like that,
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.360]   either I'm going to view sunlight
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.080]   at a time that corresponds to the circadian dead zone,
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.500]   the time in which my circadian clock can't be shifted,
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.920]   or I'm going to end up viewing sunlight
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.660]   at a time that corresponds to the four to six hour window
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:32.660]   before my temperature minimum.
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.760]   So it's going to shift me in exactly the opposite direction
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.160]   that I want to go.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.820]   So it can be very, very challenging
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.920]   for people to adjust to jet lag.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.240]   So you need to ask, am I traveling east
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.120]   or am I traveling west?
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.960]   Am I trying to advance my clock or delay my clock?
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.780]   Remember, viewing light, exercise, and eating
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.080]   in the four to six hours before your temperature minimum
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.120]   will delay your clock.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.240]   Eating, viewing sunlight, and exercising,
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.280]   you don't have to do all three,
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.920]   but some combination of those in the four to six hours
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.060]   after your temperature minimum will advance your clock.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.680]   And this is a powerful mechanism
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.660]   by which you can shift your clock anywhere
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:13.140]   from one to three hours per day, which is remarkable.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.200]   That means your temperature minimum is going to shift out
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.420]   as much as three hours,
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.860]   which can make it such that you can travel
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.800]   all the way to Europe.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.920]   And as long as you've prepared for a day or so
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.800]   by doing what I described back home,
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.160]   and then doing it when you arrive,
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.400]   you can potentially accomplish the entire shift
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.320]   within anywhere from 24 to 36 hours.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:40.080]   And this is really important to emphasize
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.600]   that once you arrive in your new location,
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.040]   and here I'm talking about traveling eastward,
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:44.920]   California to Europe.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.360]   Once you arrive in your new location,
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:51.360]   you have to keep track of what your temperature minimum was
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:54.460]   back home and how it's being shifted during your trip.
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.680]   Now it's much easier to do than you think.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:01.160]   One of the unfortunate consequences of the smartphone
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.400]   is that you can't do something goofy
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.400]   like wearing two watches,
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.440]   one watch that corresponds to the time back home
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.080]   and another one that corresponds to the local time.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:15.080]   Typically it updates automatically based on wifi, et cetera.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.280]   But if you can keep track of the time back home,
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.520]   then you can easily shift your clock going forward.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.120]   I'm hoping this makes sense.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.400]   I really want to emphasize that you don't have to be precise
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.600]   down to the minute.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.760]   Some of you may be asking,
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.380]   well, what about, you've got this temperature minimum,
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.440]   and if I view light one minute before it,
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.620]   then I'm going to delay my clock,
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.600]   and one minute after it, I'm going to advance my clock.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.200]   It doesn't quite work like that, okay?
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.760]   But it's very important to understand
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.120]   that light is the primary way
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.340]   in which we can shift our clock.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.400]   And now you should also be able to understand things
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.880]   like the circadian dead zone from about 9.30, 10 a.m.,
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:58.780]   all the way until six hours before your temperature minimum,
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.240]   you're not going to shift your clock.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.520]   Nothing that you do in that time
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.720]   in terms of light viewing behavior, feeding, et cetera,
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.160]   is going to shift your clock.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.280]   And so a lot of people are landing in Europe,
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.240]   getting sunlight in their eyes,
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.820]   and throwing their clock out of whack
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.120]   or not shifting their clock at all.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.360]   This brings me to the other thing that's highly recommended,
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.400]   and I've mentioned this before,
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.780]   but you want to eat on the local meal schedule.
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:26.220]   If it's in your practice to fast, fast, that's fine.
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.500]   But when you eat,
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:31.540]   you want to eat within the local schedule for alertness.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.380]   Okay.
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:35.920]   That means if you arrive and everyone's eating breakfast
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.260]   and you can't stomach the idea of breakfast
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.100]   in your new location 'cause your appetite isn't there,
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.620]   that means the clock in your liver,
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:44.460]   you have a clock in your liver, biological clock,
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.700]   has not caught up to the new time zone.
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:51.220]   You can force yourself to eat if you like,
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.200]   or you can skip that meal.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.740]   But what you don't want to do
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.460]   is stay on your home meal schedule,
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:58.860]   waking up in the middle of the night and eating.
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.380]   That is really going to throw things off
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.600]   because a lot of the clocks in the periphery,
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.660]   like from the liver, the peripheral body,
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.660]   will send information back to the brain,
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:09.380]   and then the brain is getting really conflicted signals.
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.260]   So the temperature minimum is really your anchor point
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.180]   for shifting your clock best.
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.260]   I don't know why this information
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.140]   really hasn't made it into the popular sphere quite so much.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.560]   There's all sorts of stuff about taking things like melatonin
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.920]   using binaural beats, a lot of kind of like
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.220]   more sophisticated, complicated,
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:31.180]   and potentially problematic ways
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.620]   of trying to shift the clock.
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.340]   Let's talk about melatonin,
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.900]   but first I just want to pause
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.920]   and shift gears a little bit
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.580]   because I talked about traveling eastward,
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.960]   but we haven't talked about traveling westward.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.380]   So I want to do that now.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.660]   Let's say you're traveling from New York to California
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:49.780]   or from Europe to California.
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:52.220]   The challenge there tends to be
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.220]   how can you stay up late enough?
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.260]   Now, some people are able to do this
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.680]   because as I mentioned earlier,
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.800]   the autonomic nervous system is asymmetrically wired
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.020]   such that it's easier to stay up late
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.180]   later than we would naturally want to
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.700]   than it is to go to sleep earlier.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.820]   So let's say you land and it's 4 p.m.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.400]   and you're just dying.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.620]   You're in California, you came from Europe, it's 4 p.m.,
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.520]   and you really, really want to go to sleep.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.940]   That's where the use of things like caffeine, exercise,
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.420]   and sunlight can shift you, right?
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.740]   If it's after your temperature peak,
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.660]   then viewing sunlight around 6 p.m. or 8 p.m.
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:31.160]   or artificial light, if there's in sunlight,
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.500]   will help shift you later, right?
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.120]   It's going to delay your clock
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.280]   and you're going to be able to stay up later.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.140]   The worst thing you can do is take a nap
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.120]   that was intended to last 20 minutes or an hour,
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.100]   I do this routinely, and then wake up four hours later,
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.280]   or you wake up and it's midnight
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.460]   and you can't fall back asleep.
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.040]   You really want to avoid doing that.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.100]   So provided it's not excessive amounts,
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.700]   stimulants like caffeine and coffee or tea
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.920]   can really help you push past that afternoon barrier
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:05.020]   and get you to sleep more like on the local schedule
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.920]   and eating on the local schedule as well.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.180]   A number of people have asked about the use of melatonin
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.900]   to induce sleepiness.
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.740]   All right, well, let's think about what melatonin is.
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:17.980]   Melatonin is this hormone
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:21.300]   that's released from the pineal gland, which is this gland.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.060]   A couple of notes about the pineal,
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.100]   'cause I've been getting a lot of questions about this.
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.640]   I'm probably going to draw some fire for this,
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:31.640]   but I'd be happy to have a thoughtful, considerate debate
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.780]   with some peer-reviewed papers in front of us.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.860]   The pineal does make this hallucinogenic molecule
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.140]   they call DMT, but in such minuscule amounts
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:44.120]   that it is not responsible for the hallucinations you see
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.220]   in sleep and dreaming.
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:46.100]   Sorry, folks.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.000]   It's also not responsible for the hallucinations
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.100]   you might see through other approaches to DMT.
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.680]   It's just not, that's not where the DMT comes from.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.440]   It's infinitesimally small amounts.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.940]   There are a lot of kind of wacky claims out there
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:03.380]   about calcification of the pineal and fluoride
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.500]   and this kind of thing.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:10.620]   Look, the pineal sits in an area of the brain
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.260]   near the fourth ventricle,
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:16.280]   where the skull is not terribly far away,
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.620]   although there's some overlapping neural tissue.
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:22.180]   And with age, there's some aggregation
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.980]   of some of the meninges and other things around there
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.300]   that stick to the skull.
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.860]   Young brains don't look like old brains,
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.900]   but there's no calcification of the pineal, all right?
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.060]   So you can forget about calcification
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.180]   of the pineal is a problem.
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:36.940]   I don't know where that whole thing got started,
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:39.000]   but that's not an issue.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.220]   Your pineal will churn out melatonin in my whole life.
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.660]   Melatonin induces sleepiness.
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.620]   Melatonin during development is also responsible
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.300]   for timing the secretion of certain hormones
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.220]   that are vitally important for puberty.
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.900]   Does melatonin control the onset of puberty?
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.500]   Not directly, but indirectly.
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.660]   Melatonin inhibits something called
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.180]   gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.340]   which is a hormone that's released from your hypothalamus,
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.100]   also roughly above the roof of your mouth and your brain.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.960]   Gonadotropin-releasing hormone is really interesting
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.320]   'cause it stimulates the release of another hormone
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.800]   called luteinizing hormone,
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.540]   which in females causes estrogen
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:22.520]   to be released within the ovaries.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.260]   It's involved in reproductive cycles.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:27.340]   And in males, stimulates testosterone
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:30.400]   from the sertoli cells of the testes.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:34.620]   Melatonin is inhibitory to GnRH,
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.900]   gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.620]   and therefore is inhibitory to LH, luteinizing hormone,
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:41.560]   and therefore is inhibitory to testosterone and estrogen.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.260]   There's just no two ways about it.
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:50.140]   There is immense amount of data on the fact
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:54.360]   that high levels of melatonin in seasonally breeding animals
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.980]   takes the ovaries from nice and robust ovaries
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:00.140]   that are capable of deploying eggs and this kind of thing,
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.060]   and literally shrinking them
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:04.360]   and making these animals infertile.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.780]   These are very high levels of melatonin
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:07.380]   in seasonal breeders in winter.
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:11.520]   Melatonin in males of seasonal breeders
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.900]   takes the testes and shrinks them.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.700]   Long ago when I was at UC Berkeley as a master student,
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.860]   I was working on neuroendocrinology
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.560]   and we were working on this hamster species
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.500]   of seasonal breeders.
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:27.480]   And basically when days are long, which inhibits melatonin,
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:30.740]   these little Siberian hamsters, as they're called,
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:34.740]   have testes about the size of sort of typical table grapes,
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.640]   although that's a weird way to put it.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:41.000]   When days get shorter and the melatonin signal gets longer
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.360]   because light inhibits melatonin,
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.920]   days get shorter, melatonin gets longer,
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.680]   those same hamsters would have testes
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.440]   that would involute to the size of about a grain of rice.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.780]   Now, this does not happen in humans in short days,
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.240]   but nonetheless, the melatonin signal
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.100]   really does have a ton of effects on the hormone system.
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.120]   Now, does that mean that if you've been taking melatonin,
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:03.220]   you've really screwed up your hormones?
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.060]   Not necessarily.
[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.780]   Does it mean if a kid has been taking melatonin
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.340]   that's really screwing up their puberty?
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:09.100]   Not necessarily, and here's why.
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:15.580]   Melatonin operates on a concentration level.
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.640]   So in a child that's very, very small,
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.220]   that has high levels of melatonin,
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:25.360]   it actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone, or estrogen,
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.960]   depending on the sex of the child.
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.300]   But as that child grows through other mechanisms,
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.060]   like growth hormone release, et cetera,
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:34.400]   that same amount of melatonin released from the pineal
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.680]   is now diluted over a much larger body,
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.820]   so the concentration actually goes way, way down, okay?
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.200]   But here's the problem with supplementing melatonin.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.220]   As I mentioned in the previous episode,
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.280]   concentrations of melatonin in many commercial supplements
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:52.420]   have been shown to be anywhere from 85% to 400%
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.460]   of what's listed on the bottle.
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.300]   So when you take melatonin, or a child takes melatonin,
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.400]   oftentimes they are taking
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.820]   supra-physiological levels of melatonin,
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:06.500]   which, at least by my read and the literature,
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.760]   says that it could have dramatic effects
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.620]   on timing and course of things like puberty.
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:16.160]   So it's not so much that the journals have come out saying,
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.500]   oh, taking that melatonin inhibits puberty,
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.280]   it's that no single study has been done
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.780]   with the supra-physiological levels of melatonin
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:26.120]   that are present in a lot of these supplements
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.040]   in developing children.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:33.720]   So melatonin is used widely for inducing sleepiness
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.880]   when you want to fall asleep
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.260]   in the new location that you've arrived, right?
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:38.100]   You can't fall asleep,
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.480]   you take melatonin, it helps you fall asleep.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.920]   It does not help you stay asleep.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.780]   In addition to that, melatonin has been kind of touted
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.480]   as the best way to shift your circadian clock.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.240]   I'm happy to go on record saying,
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.400]   look, if you need melatonin,
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.760]   you can work with a doctor or somebody
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.000]   who really understands circadian and sleep biology,
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.920]   go for it if that's your thing.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:01.720]   But I, as always on this podcast and elsewhere,
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.680]   I have a bias toward behavioral things
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.960]   that you can titrate and control,
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.880]   like exposure to light, exercise, temperature, et cetera,
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.680]   that have much bigger margins for safety
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.680]   and certainly don't have these other endocrine effects
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.380]   that we've been thinking about and talking about.
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:20.680]   So if you want to take melatonin in the afternoon
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.800]   in order to fall asleep or in the evening,
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.840]   be my guest, that's up to you.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.720]   Again, you're responsible for your health, not me.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.640]   But for many people,
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.280]   melatonin is not going to be the best solution.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:35.140]   The best solution is going to be to use light
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:36.920]   and temperature and exercise
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.180]   on either side of the temperature minimum
[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:41.040]   to shift your clock both before your trip
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.760]   and when you land in your new location
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.640]   and your clock starts to shift.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.920]   Okay, so now you know my opinions about melatonin.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.960]   Feel free to filter them through your own opinions
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.320]   and experiences with melatonin.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.880]   And now you also understand what your temperature minimum is
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.560]   and how it represents an important landmark,
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.960]   either side of which you can use light temperature
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.480]   and exercise to shift your clock.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.120]   Just to remind you a little bit about temperature,
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.840]   if you want to shift your clock,
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.040]   typically you would do that by,
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.120]   you could take a hot shower
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.200]   and then that will have a cooling effect
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.560]   after the hot shower.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:20.860]   And if you were to get into a cold shower or an ice bath,
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.220]   if you have access to one,
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.520]   afterward there's going to be a thermogenic effect
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.720]   of your body increasing temperature.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:30.060]   And if you just think about your natural rhythm back home
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:31.300]   when everything's stable,
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:35.500]   you have a nadir, a low point in,
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.620]   which is your temperature minimum,
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:38.840]   and then you have a peak and you think about
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.580]   when you're doing this hot or cold shower in that rhythm,
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:44.000]   now you should be able to understand
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.720]   how you're shifting your rhythm.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:48.040]   That temperature rhythm is the one that's going to move.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.440]   Give you an example.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.740]   If I were to wake up in the morning
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:54.440]   and let's say I wake up at 6 a.m.,
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.960]   my temperature I know is rising,
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.620]   I've passed my temperature minimum,
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:00.160]   if I were to get into a hot shower
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:04.420]   that would then lower my body temperature when I got out,
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:06.400]   that is not normally what's happening
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.220]   first thing in the morning.
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.260]   And therefore my clock would very likely get phase delayed.
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.140]   Right, it's going to delay the increase in temperature.
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.360]   Whereas if I got into a cold shower,
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.640]   something I don't personally like to do,
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.800]   but I've done from time to time,
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.440]   or an ice bath, that's going to then
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.880]   have a rebound increase in body temperature
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.700]   and is going to phase advance my clock.
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:28.880]   That peak in the afternoon is going to come
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.380]   about an hour earlier.
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:33.000]   I'm going to want to go to bed earlier, later that night.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.300]   So you can start to play these games
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.400]   with timing and hot and cold,
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.920]   with meals, whether or not you eat or you don't eat,
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.140]   and with light exposure,
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.620]   whether or not you view light or you don't view light.
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.600]   So now you can start to see why understanding
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.660]   the core mechanics of a system
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.420]   can really give you the most flexibility
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:53.200]   because I could spend the next 25 years of my life
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.420]   answering every question
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.740]   about every nuanced pattern of travel.
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.700]   Well, we're going to Sydney and then we're going there.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:52:59.620]   What should I do?
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:00.760]   But that's on you.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.920]   You need to figure out your temperature minimum
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.700]   and your temperature peak, if you like,
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:07.420]   and then use these parameters to, it gives you flexibility.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:09.460]   And that really underscores the most important thing
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:10.920]   is that when you understand mechanism,
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.620]   it's not about being neurotically attached
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:14.660]   to a specific protocol.
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:15.780]   It's the opposite.
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:18.600]   It gives you power to not be neurotically attached
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.980]   to a specific protocol.
[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:22.660]   It can give you great confidence and flexibility
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:24.740]   in being able to shift your body rhythms however you want.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:25.700]   And when things get out of whack,
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:27.700]   you can tuck them right back into place.
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.660]   One thing that's common
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.660]   is that people need to do a quick trip.
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.660]   It's not always that you're going to go to, you know,
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:36.980]   on vacation for two weeks or, you know,
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:40.080]   work someplace else for weeks on end.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:44.660]   If your trip is 48 hours or less,
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:46.560]   stay on your home schedule.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:50.100]   This can be tough and it may require scheduling meetings
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.220]   according to your home schedule.
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:55.420]   But if you can somehow manage that,
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:58.020]   the best thing to do would be to stay on your home schedule.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:01.460]   Your clock is not going to shift more than a couple hours,
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:06.060]   even if you do everything correctly in one day, okay?
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:09.200]   So if I were to travel, say to Europe,
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.060]   I've actually done this.
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:12.280]   I did a 24 hour trip to Basel, Switzerland,
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.460]   gave a talk and came back.
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:14.420]   People thought I was crazy,
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:16.840]   but I had a little bit of travel fatigue.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.820]   'Cause remember there's fatigue
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.800]   from the actual travel experience.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.680]   The novelty of it, the air is never great on the planes.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:24.780]   This was even true before.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.100]   There were mask requirements and things like that.
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:28.220]   There's the travel fatigue,
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:30.680]   but you don't throw your clock off.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:33.140]   If you stay 48 hours,
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:36.420]   then you start to shift a little bit.
[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.840]   72, that's when you start running into trouble.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.160]   The transit time is also important,
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.600]   but I would say if it's three days or less,
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.800]   stay on your home schedule as much as you can.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.920]   And because sunlight isn't under your control,
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.960]   unless there's something about you I don't know,
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.580]   that's when traveling with some sort of bright light,
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.960]   like the light pad that I have down there
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.720]   that I showed earlier.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.080]   For those of you listening just on audio,
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:03.320]   it's just, it looks like an eight and a half by 11 pad.
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.840]   It's actually not designed for wake up.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.720]   It's actually designed, it's a drawing pad,
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:11.720]   and you can, and it emits about a thousand lux of light.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:15.080]   And so if you want to travel with something like that,
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:16.800]   you can use that in your hotel room
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.260]   to wake up when you like.
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:22.200]   Some people will use nightshades,
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.640]   you know, not the nightshades that you eat
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.980]   or that some people say you're not supposed to eat.
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:27.060]   I don't know anything about that.
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:31.780]   But the eye covers that to keep light out,
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:36.480]   those can be very useful on planes and in hotels and so on.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.600]   So you can use light and dark
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.320]   and you can travel with your light and dark devices
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.240]   so that you can stay on your home schedule
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.260]   and get most of your light
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:48.680]   when it would be your normal wake up time back home.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.880]   And what's kind of nice is if you know
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.360]   when your circadian dead zone is back home,
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:57.720]   which is generally for most people around 10 a.m.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.640]   to about 3 p.m.,
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.920]   so basically the rising phase of your temperature,
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:06.640]   then you can also feel free to be outside
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:07.960]   without having to wear sunglasses
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.880]   or you don't have to worry about light exposure.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:14.480]   But if you know that window before your temperature minimum,
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.900]   that four to six hour window,
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.960]   that's the time when if you're viewing a lot of light
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.480]   in your new location,
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.960]   you are going to shift your clock pretty considerably
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:24.680]   and then you can come back home and have a terrible time.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:27.200]   At the end of graduate school, I went to Australia,
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.520]   the remarkable country, incredible people,
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.680]   incredible wildlife, an amazing time.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.200]   I came back and it was the first time in my life
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.500]   where I couldn't sleep on a regular schedule.
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.660]   I was sleeping in like hour long increments
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:39.500]   throughout the day.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.860]   It was a nightmare.
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:44.440]   And it took me weeks to get back on target.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.920]   And the way I was able to do that was exercising consistently
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.580]   at the same time every 24 hours,
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:54.760]   turning my home into essentially a cave at night,
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.400]   even covering up the windows,
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.480]   and then getting as much bright light in my eyes
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:01.940]   as I possibly could during the day, no sunglasses, et cetera.
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.200]   So it can take some real work
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.520]   if your clock gets thrown out of whack.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.580]   There's a phenomenon called ICU psychosis,
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:11.080]   where people that are in the intensive care unit
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.440]   in hospitals actually lose their mind.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:18.000]   They become psychotic, hallucinations, et cetera.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.240]   And it's because of altered circadian cycles.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.960]   We know this because they're exposed to these lights
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:26.000]   and these sounds, people coming in and checking on them.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.200]   They leave the hospital or in some cases,
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:29.500]   there've been experiments where people are placed
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.320]   near a window where they get some natural light
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.760]   and these psychotic symptoms disappear,
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:37.200]   presuming there weren't psychotic symptoms beforehand,
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.760]   before they entered the hospital.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:42.720]   So it's pretty dramatic what light can do
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.840]   to the psyche and to the body.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:49.160]   So let's talk a little bit about a different form of jet lag
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:52.920]   that requires no planes, no trains, no automobiles,
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.420]   and that's shift work.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:58.180]   Shift work is becoming increasingly common.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:02.040]   Many of us are shift working even though we don't have to.
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:03.920]   We're doing work in the middle of the night.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.200]   We are working on our computers at odd hours,
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:09.200]   sleeping during the day.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:12.560]   A lot of people who are under shelter in place type stuff
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:15.120]   are doing more of this.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.040]   Kids with the drifting school schedules.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.760]   Here's the deal with shift work.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.660]   If there's one rule of thumb for shift work,
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:25.860]   it's that if at all possible,
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:29.820]   you want to stay on the same schedule for at least 14 days,
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.660]   including weekends.
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:34.900]   Now that should immediately cue the non-shift workers
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.620]   to the importance of not getting too far off track
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.340]   on the weekend even if you're not a shift worker.
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:43.000]   So sleeping in on Sunday is not a good idea.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.420]   The most important thing about shift work
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:49.140]   is to stay consistent with your schedule.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:52.060]   Now I had a conversation on an Instagram Live
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:55.980]   with Samir Hattar, who's a neuroscientist
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.560]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:59.660]   He's actually the head of the Chronobiology Unit there.
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:02.200]   And he was really emphasizing this point
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:04.160]   because shift work where people are doing
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.340]   the so-called swing shift,
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:07.000]   where they're working four days on one shift
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.260]   and four days on another is extremely detrimental
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.540]   to a number of health parameters.
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:14.880]   It gets the cortisol release from the adrenals
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.240]   really out of whack.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.440]   And there are these cortisol spikes
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.160]   at various hours of the day.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:21.540]   It messes up learning.
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:24.660]   It really disrupts the dopamine system and wellbeing.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:26.540]   It is a serious, serious problem.
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:29.620]   So if you can negotiate with your employer
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:34.180]   to stay on the same shift for two weeks at a time,
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:35.820]   that's going to be immensely beneficial
[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:37.920]   and will help you offset a lot of the negative effects
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:38.760]   of shift work.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.680]   Now, I don't presume that all of you
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.240]   are going to be able to do that.
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:46.400]   Some of you just don't have that level of control.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:48.040]   And of course, I want to acknowledge
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:51.520]   that shift workers are essential, right?
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.460]   Of course, first responders, firefighters,
[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:55.700]   police officers, paramedics, et cetera,
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:58.660]   but also pilots, nurses,
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:02.580]   people working on the hospital wards,
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.140]   people picking up trash.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.100]   These night shifts are critical
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:07.880]   to our functioning as a society,
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.860]   as I'm sure all of you can appreciate.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.780]   If you're going to work a shift where,
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:17.780]   let's say you start at 4 p.m. and you end at 2 a.m.,
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:21.220]   excuse me, then there's some important questions
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.060]   that arise.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:26.280]   For instance, should you see light during your shift?
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.600]   Well, this is a matter of personal choice,
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.280]   but ideally you want to view as much light as possible
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.260]   and as safely possible when you need to be alert.
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:38.120]   So that would mean from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.180]   And then you would want to sleep.
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:45.900]   So using light as a correlate of alertness
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.920]   and using darkness as a correlate of sleepiness,
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.480]   what this means is see as much light as you safely can
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.100]   during the phase of your day when you want to be awake.
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.320]   So it's the same thing I said way back
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.520]   at the beginning of this podcast episode.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.800]   And see as little light as safely possible
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.960]   and allows you to function during the time
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.320]   when you want to be asleep.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.880]   So if you're finishing out that 2 a.m. shift,
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.760]   that's when you would want to avoid bright light exposure,
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.880]   you'd want to go home,
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.600]   you'd really want to avoid watching TV if possible.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.180]   If you need that in order to fall asleep,
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:21.720]   that would be a case where something like dimming the screen
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.000]   plus blue blockers, if that's in your practice,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.800]   or you want to do that would be helpful
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.700]   and then going to sleep.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.640]   And then you'll probably wake up late in the afternoon
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.040]   or early afternoon.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.960]   Some of you might say, wait, Huberman,
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.100]   I thought you don't like blue blockers.
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.440]   I never said I don't like blue blockers.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.840]   I don't like people wearing blue blockers
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.520]   at the time of day when they want to be alert.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.200]   And I don't like people asserting that blue blockers
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.040]   can prevent circadian shifts
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.380]   simply because people are wearing them.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:48.000]   The brightness of light is what's important.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.700]   It's not about the blue.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.500]   So if you want to wear them, wear them,
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:56.180]   or just dim the lights or turn the lights off.
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:59.140]   So let's say you go to sleep at,
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:02.600]   you get home after this 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift,
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.480]   you maybe eat something, you go to sleep,
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:10.480]   and you wake up and it's noon or 1 p.m.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.240]   Should you get light in your eyes?
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.620]   Well, your first assumption,
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:15.860]   based on what I've said previously,
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.680]   might be that you're in the circadian dead zone,
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.260]   that you can't because it's noon or 1 p.m.
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:21.800]   But you're not in the circadian dead zone
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.800]   because you're somebody who goes to sleep
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.300]   early in the morning at 2 a.m.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.740]   So it's not like the circadian dead zone
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:31.580]   is a strict time of day.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:34.020]   It's an internal biological clock.
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.080]   So what do you need to know?
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:36.980]   You guessed it.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.180]   You need to know your temperature minimum.
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.880]   You need to know whether or not
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.740]   your temperature is increasing or decreasing.
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.820]   And now we can make this whole thing even simpler
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:50.480]   and just say if your temperature is decreasing, avoid light.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.520]   If your temperature is increasing, get light.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.920]   It's that simple.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.120]   Okay, if your temperature is decreasing, avoid light.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.600]   If your temperature is increasing, get light.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:09.600]   The shift worker who works from 4 p.m. until 2 a.m.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.880]   has a temperature rhythm that's very different than mine
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.600]   where I wake up around 6 a.m., 5 a.m.,
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.720]   and I go to sleep around 11 p.m., okay?
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:23.560]   We both have a 24-hour-ish circadian cycle
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.980]   except mine is more aligned to the rise
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.900]   and setting of the sun and theirs is not, right?
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:33.360]   So you have to know your internal temperature rhythm
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.220]   and know you don't have to walk around with a thermometer
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.360]   wherever taking your temperature.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.140]   Although it'd be great if some of the devices
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:43.420]   that are out there, people are counting their steps.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.220]   I think it'd be great if people had a circadian body
[01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:47.060]   temperature measurement.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.900]   I'm not involved in any of this device development
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:52.060]   but I think it's a real call to arms, pun intended,
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:55.060]   to have a wristband that would measure temperature
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.500]   and would tell you your temperature minimum
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.580]   when you travel or whatnot.
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:00.240]   I don't know, maybe some of these devices already do that
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.500]   but if they don't, they should.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.600]   It's absolutely absurd to me
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.060]   why we wouldn't have this simple measurement.
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.380]   Very easy to get that kind of information.
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:10.480]   You don't even need the exact temperature read.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.100]   All you need to know is the high and low point.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.900]   So let's say you're a shift worker
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:18.240]   who really is nocturnal, you're flipped.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.940]   Well, you want to stay on that nocturnal schedule.
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.220]   Now that can be very hard on families and social life
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.380]   of all kinds but the person who is working say from,
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:31.980]   you know, 8 p.m., like sundown to sunrise,
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:34.380]   this raises a question.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:37.180]   Should they be looking at the sunrise
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:39.500]   and should they be watching the sunset,
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.060]   waking up with the sunset, going to sleep with the sunrise?
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:46.260]   You think, well, is that light going to throw them off?
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:47.160]   Probably not.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.480]   It's just actually going to invert
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.200]   what sunrise and sunset are.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.620]   When they're waking up in the morning,
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:54.380]   if they look at the, you know,
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:55.700]   they get some sunlight in their eyes,
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.520]   they look at the sun and get some bright light from devices
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.060]   or overhead lights in their apartment or home,
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.220]   well, that's going to tend to wake them up
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:06.220]   if it's in the evening, right?
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.760]   So it's, you know, I don't know if I stated that clearly
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.360]   but if in the evening the sun is setting
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.820]   and they're looking at that setting sun,
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:15.420]   that is the morning sun for that person
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:18.520]   and it will wake them up for their night shift.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.260]   So temperature rising.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:22.600]   Then toward morning, what's happening?
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.380]   Okay, well, they're closing out their work shift,
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:26.980]   you're going home, the sun is rising.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:28.440]   Do you look at the rising sun?
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.260]   Well, based on what you now know,
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.700]   your eyes are very sensitive
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.040]   to resetting of circadian clocks.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.380]   What will it do at that time?
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:36.260]   If this were a classroom,
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:38.300]   I would either cold call on somebody
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.660]   or I'd wait for the oh, oh, oh, oh person in the audience.
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:42.880]   Inevitably exists.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.740]   So temperature for that person,
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:48.060]   they've been up for a while,
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:50.300]   temperature is falling, not rising.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:52.380]   For me, it would be rising,
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:56.540]   but 'cause I'm not diurnal, I'm awake during the day.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.260]   For that person, the temperature is falling
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:01.140]   and so they view light while temperature is falling.
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:01.980]   What's it going to do?
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.020]   It's going to phase delay them.
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:05.400]   It's going to make it harder for them
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.240]   to get to sleep the following night.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:10.500]   So you would say that person should watch the setting sun
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.140]   to help them wake up
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:13.580]   'cause they're going to work the night shift,
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.200]   but should probably have sunglasses on
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.160]   or avoid viewing bright light before they go to sleep.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.200]   So it's the same thing.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.300]   They're just on an inverted,
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.220]   as a typical person who's diurnal,
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:26.460]   but they're on an inverted schedule.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:28.860]   So I'm really trying hard here
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:31.140]   to make this all really clear.
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:35.600]   There are kind of two patterns of requests in the world
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.240]   I'm noticing as I've kind of ventured
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:40.840]   into this landscape of social media and podcasts.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.480]   There are people who want to know every detail,
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.600]   want to quantify everything
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.000]   'cause they want to get it exactly right.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.680]   These are like the graduate students and students
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.180]   that don't want to make a mistake.
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:51.220]   And to quote my graduate advisor,
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:54.600]   provided the mistakes are not dangerous,
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.160]   certainly not lethal,
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:59.720]   you kind of want to make a few little mistakes
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.620]   so that you can adjust, right?
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:03.080]   You don't want to endanger yourself,
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.960]   but it's actually, you're not going to get things perfect.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:06.780]   That's called learning.
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:07.900]   Learning is when you realize,
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:10.020]   ah, I viewed some this time and then I stayed up
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.160]   and it really messed me up.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.420]   I'll never do that again.
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:18.040]   The other category of people seem to want
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.160]   the one size fits all kind of like,
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.820]   give me this pill or give me this protocol.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.000]   And those things generally work,
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.560]   but they don't afford people flexibility.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.580]   And if there's anything like that,
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:31.820]   it's this temperature minimum thing
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.720]   that I've been just hammering on again
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:34.700]   and again and again today,
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:36.820]   because it's something that you own
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:39.820]   and that you can really use as a key landmark
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.760]   for shifting your clock.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.140]   I suppose there's a third category,
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:48.040]   which is people who accept that biological systems
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.600]   are actually much more forgiving
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.960]   than the way they're sometimes described.
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.780]   And I'm going to use this as an opportunity
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:56.120]   to editorialize a little bit.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.540]   You know, there's so much made of sleep debt.
[01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:01.480]   Look, there isn't an IRS equivalent for sleep.
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.560]   They're not going to come around
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.500]   and try and collect all the sleep that you didn't get.
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:09.080]   No one really knows what the consequences
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.840]   are going to be for you and for me
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.020]   and for the next person for the sleep you didn't get.
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:16.900]   You can't really recover the sleep you missed out on,
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:18.400]   but you also don't want to get
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:19.940]   neurotically attached to a schedule
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:21.700]   because there's this thing called sleep anxiety
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.180]   and then people have trouble falling asleep
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.080]   and staying asleep.
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.840]   So I want to spend a moment on that
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.200]   and go back to a theme that I've said many times before,
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.960]   because these tools work.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.440]   What I called NSDR, non-sleep-depress,
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.240]   so this would be hypnosis.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.360]   I gave you the link, but I'll say it again,
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:41.440]   reveriehealth.com for clinically tested, research tested,
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:46.440]   free hypnosis for anxiety, but also for sleep.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.140]   Those are very beneficial people.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.420]   NSDR protocols, non-sleep-depress protocols
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:53.140]   for things like yoga nidra.
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:56.280]   I provide some links to those in the caption for episode two.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:57.240]   These things really work.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.200]   Last night I woke up, I went to bed about 1030.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.120]   I woke up at three in the morning.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.360]   I knew I wasn't feeling rested.
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:07.200]   I did a NSDR protocol.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.280]   I fell back asleep.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:10.520]   I woke up at 630, okay?
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.440]   You need to teach your brain and your nervous system
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.700]   how to turn off your thoughts and go to sleep.
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.340]   And ideally you do that without medication
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:18.740]   unless there's a real need.
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:20.360]   You do that through these behavioral protocols.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:23.720]   They work because they involve using the body
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:26.000]   to shift the mind, not trying to just turn off your thoughts
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.420]   in the middle of the night.
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.000]   Now, there are periods of life where things are stressful
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.840]   and people are concerned and you will have some struggle
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.240]   getting and staying asleep.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:39.020]   And that really has to do more with anxiety,
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:42.520]   which NSDR protocols also can help with.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.960]   As I always say, do them in the middle of the night
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.420]   if you wake up and you want to go back to sleep,
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:46.260]   do them in the middle of the day
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:47.520]   to teach your nervous system how to calm down
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.560]   or do them first thing in the morning
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.800]   if you didn't feel you got enough sleep.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.080]   In other words, do them whenever you have an opportunity
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.960]   to do them because they really can help you learn
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.200]   how to turn on the parasympathetic/calming arm
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.800]   of your autonomic nervous system.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:06.960]   There's no other way that I'm aware of to teach your system
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.680]   to slow down and turn off your thoughts
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:09.520]   and go back to sleep.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.680]   But these are powerful protocols
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.040]   and there's a lot of research now to support the fact
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.120]   that they can really help.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.060]   Meditation would be another example.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:20.880]   Meditation of certain kinds of meditation
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.160]   involve focus and alertness.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.140]   Those are slightly different than meditations
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.720]   that involve lack of focus and attention
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.240]   to say internal states.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.620]   I'm going to pause there.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:34.040]   And then I want to talk about kids and the elderly.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.620]   In other words, how do we control sleep
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:40.760]   and circadian rhythms and wakefulness in babies,
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.840]   adolescents, teens, and aged folks?
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:49.040]   All right, before we talk about sleep and kids,
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.620]   I want to tell a little story.
[01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:52.040]   It's not a joke.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.720]   Many of you will be relieved that I'm not going to try
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.680]   and tell another joke this episode,
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:59.300]   which is the relationship between light,
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:02.680]   skin and pelage color,
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:08.860]   dopamine and reproduction, mating.
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:14.000]   So many seasonally breeding animals,
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.040]   Siberian hamsters, which I mentioned earlier,
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:20.440]   rabbits, fox, other animals change their color
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.040]   of their coat.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.140]   In the winter, they tend to be a lighter color,
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.700]   sometimes pure white,
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:29.080]   sometimes with flecks of black or brown.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:33.440]   And in the summer, their pelage changes
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.480]   to a color of brown or red,
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.420]   some other vastly different color.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:43.580]   That shift is controlled by light and by melatonin.
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:48.680]   This has an interesting correlate in humans.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:52.640]   So humans obviously have different skin tones
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:56.160]   just genetically because of the amount of melanin
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.180]   in one's skin, depending on genetic background.
[01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:03.600]   But of course, sunlight will increase the amount of melanin
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.640]   in the skin regardless, right?
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:09.400]   This is suntan, sunburn, et cetera, bronzing, whatever.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:16.520]   The whole system is wired so that shifts in skin color
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.920]   and shifts in these cells within the eye and melatonin
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.440]   are actually very closely linked.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.460]   So here's the story.
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:29.880]   Many years ago, meaning about 10 years ago, 15 years ago,
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:35.040]   let's see, it was 20 years ago, forgive me,
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.240]   a guy named Iggy Provencio,
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:42.240]   who was running his own lab at Uniformed Armed Services,
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.040]   this is a standard biological laboratory,
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:50.040]   discovered that there was an opsin in the eye,
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.640]   in the cells of the eye that connect
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.320]   to the rest of the brain called melanopsin.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:57.120]   Melanopsin, as many of you now know, is the opsin,
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.800]   it's like a pigment, it absorbs light.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.680]   It is the opsin that converts light into electrical signals
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.320]   that then set the circadian clock.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:12.080]   Iggy discovered melanopsin because it was similar in form
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:18.680]   to what was in frog melanophores.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.980]   It was actually in the skin of frogs
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:24.720]   that allowed those frogs to go from pale white
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.280]   when it was dark for most of the 24-hour cycle
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:33.100]   to pigmented, green or brown for a frog.
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:37.820]   So there's this relationship between the cells in our eye
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:39.620]   and the pigment cells of our skin.
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:44.280]   And we also know that in long days there's more breeding.
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.120]   How does that work?
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.500]   Well, that's actually from dopamine
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.260]   triggering increases in testosterone,
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.980]   mainly in males and estrogen mainly in females,
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:55.400]   although of course there's testosterone and estrogen
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:57.180]   in both sexes.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:01.420]   So we have this kind of pathway where it's light,
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.780]   increases in melanin, dopamine and reproduction
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:07.040]   on the one hand and lack of light,
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:11.840]   melatonin decreases in the darkness of skin,
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.520]   less melanin in the skin or in the case of an animal
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.760]   with white fur and no reproduction on the other hand.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:24.780]   And humans don't actually shift their breeding patterns
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:28.400]   tremendously from long days and short days,
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:31.640]   although there are some data that there's some shifts.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.560]   We also don't radically change our skin color
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.560]   depending on how much sunlight exposure we have.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.680]   But the simple way to put this is when days are long,
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.760]   there's a lot more dopamine and we feel really good
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:47.960]   and there's a lot more breeding and breeding like behavior.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:51.680]   When days are short, there's a lot less dopamine
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.420]   and a lot less breeding behavior
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:57.640]   because these pathways are very highly conserved.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:02.200]   Now what's interesting is that as we've moved
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.240]   into a modern society where much of our waking days,
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.040]   we are looking at screens, which is fine
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.400]   'cause we're getting a lot of light that way,
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.140]   although not as much as sunlight.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:15.500]   But also at night, we're getting a lot of light from screens.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:20.440]   What's happened is all these pathways, melanin in the skin,
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:23.080]   turnover of skin cells, dopamine,
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:26.640]   all of this stuff has become completely disrupted.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.640]   Now that's not to say that we should go back to a time
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.600]   in which we didn't use artificial lights.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.400]   But I think the important thing to realize
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.320]   is that feeling good with getting a lot of light,
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:42.560]   the relationship to dopamine and melanin in the skin
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:46.440]   and the good feelings of getting light also on our skin
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.000]   provided you're not getting burned
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.560]   or you're not getting excessive UV exposure,
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:53.160]   those are not just coincidences.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.400]   Those are hardwired biological mechanisms
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.620]   that exist in everybody regardless of how light or dark
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.960]   your skin is to begin with.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.240]   There's another point which is important,
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.760]   which is that the dopamine system,
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:09.900]   which is this feel-good molecule is very closely related
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:12.700]   to the testosterone and estrogen and reproductive cycles.
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:16.640]   Remember, melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.460]   luteinizing hormone and the production of these hormones
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:21.520]   and melatonin is the effector.
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.440]   It is the hormone of darkness.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:27.920]   So I just threw a lot of biology at you
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.820]   and I'm not saying you're like a Siberian hamster,
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:32.800]   at least not in ways that I'm aware of.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.120]   I'm not saying that your pelage color is going to change.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.840]   Actually, the reason people go gray
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.760]   is because when you're really stressed, did you know this?
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.440]   When you're really stressed,
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.680]   there's an increase in the nerve fibers
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:48.320]   that release adrenaline to the hair follicle
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.860]   and that activates peroxide groups in the hair follicle
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:55.600]   that cause the hair to actually go gray or white.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:58.760]   So actually, stress does make your hair gray or white.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:16:59.840]   Aging does it too.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.140]   That was a brief aside,
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:04.820]   but for those of you that are interested
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:07.640]   in the relationship between light and skin tone
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:08.480]   and all that kind of stuff,
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.520]   I thought you might find it interesting
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:11.960]   that these cells in your eye are a lot like
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.360]   these skin cells in frogs or in animals
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:20.360]   that shift their entire color and sometimes metamorphosize.
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.500]   There are some species that literally change shape
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.480]   in the reproductive organs.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.940]   In fact, if that wasn't weird enough,
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.680]   when I was in graduate school at Berkeley,
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:30.880]   there was another graduate student studying a species
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.320]   of hermaphroditic mole, those little things that dig,
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.760]   hermaphroditic mole that would change from having ovaries
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:43.880]   to testes and back again, depending on day life.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:48.880]   Super cool, super different and wild biological mechanism.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.880]   If you're wondering how those animals reproduce,
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.020]   they actually adjust the numbers of males and females,
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:56.760]   depending on the density of males and females.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:59.280]   So if they're too many males,
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.920]   some of the males turn their testes into ovaries.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:03.960]   And if they're too many females,
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.640]   they turn their ovaries into testes.
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.640]   They actually are true hermaphroditic animals
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.840]   as opposed to pseudo hermaphroditic animals.
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:13.940]   Okay, let's get back on track.
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:17.160]   Let's talk about the animal that most of you care about,
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:22.120]   which is the human animal, new parents and babies.
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.600]   All right, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:28.440]   melatonin is not cyclic, it's not cycling in babies,
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:30.720]   it's more phasic, it's being released
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.700]   at a kind of a constant level.
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:35.920]   And babies tend to be smaller than adults, they are.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:38.740]   And so those concentrations of melatonin are very high.
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:41.680]   As a baby grows, those concentrations per unit volume
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:42.740]   are going to go down.
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:47.320]   Babies are not born with a typical sleep-wake cycle.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.860]   And now all the parents saying,
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:50.560]   "Tell me something I didn't know."
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.440]   They also have, and I really want to emphasize this,
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.780]   they also have much more sensitive optics of the eye.
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:02.180]   So a number of people have asked me,
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:04.780]   should I be exposing my baby to sunlight?
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:06.240]   You don't want to avoid sunlight,
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.240]   but their eyes are very sensitive,
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.560]   the optics of their eyes aren't quite developed,
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:14.520]   so much so that when you look at a newborn baby
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:16.720]   and they look a little glassy-eyed
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:17.760]   and they're kind of looking through you,
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.100]   or even a young child,
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.600]   a lot of people think that they're seeing you
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.080]   the way that you're seeing them.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.080]   Hate to break it to you,
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:29.080]   but if you ever can just Google a visual image
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:32.240]   of like a one-month-old,
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:34.360]   the optics of their eyes are so poor
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:35.960]   that you're a cloudy image.
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.180]   They're not seeing your fine detail.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.840]   As the optics get better,
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:43.280]   then they will see you with more and more clarity.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.060]   But a lot of that is clearing of the lens
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:48.880]   and some of the other aqueous features of the newborn eye.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.320]   They don't see very well.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.260]   But they also don't have such great ways
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:55.700]   of adjusting to bright light.
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:58.320]   And so babies have a natural aversion to bright light,
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.080]   so you really want to avoid trying to use
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.360]   sunlight or really bright light
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.240]   in the same way that you would for an adult
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.920]   on a young baby or child.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:10.120]   As children get older, however,
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:13.160]   melatonin does start to become slightly more cyclic,
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.400]   slightly more cycled,
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.920]   and their body temperature rhythms
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:19.280]   also start to fall into a more regular,
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.920]   not quite 24-hour rhythm.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.480]   They're more of these ultradian rhythms.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:24.000]   So in an episode,
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.360]   I think it was one or two of the podcast or maybe both,
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.800]   we talked about these 90-minute so-called ultradian rhythms
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.200]   where every 90 minutes,
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:37.640]   babies are going through a cycle of body temperature
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.160]   and some other hormonal features.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:42.060]   I mean, so much is changing in their system.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:45.640]   So what to do if a child isn't sleeping?
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:49.440]   You can use phases of darkness and phases of light,
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.880]   but they're going to have to be shortened
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.440]   in order to try and encourage sleep
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:53.600]   when you want the child to sleep.
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.680]   It's not that they're just not going to fall
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:58.740]   into an adult-like regime of a temperature minimum
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:00.120]   and a temperature maximum.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.680]   Their temperature minimums and maximums
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.800]   are fluctuating much more quickly,
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.380]   and it varies tremendously.
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:08.680]   Actually, there's an interesting literature
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:10.040]   of whether or not they have siblings,
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.000]   whether or not they're twins,
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.120]   whether or not they're in a nursery environment,
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.800]   whether or not they're alone.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.380]   Hopefully the baby's not alone, but you know what I mean,
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:17.600]   that they're sleeping alone in a room
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.640]   while you're in the other room.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.620]   There are a couple of things that seem to help,
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.460]   which is getting the overall environment
[01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:25.200]   into a 24-hour schedule.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.840]   So having the room slightly colder,
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.960]   obviously you want babies to be nice and cozy,
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:32.740]   slightly colder when you would like them to be asleep,
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:34.120]   slightly warmer for the times
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.120]   you would like them to be awake.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.000]   Babies tend to run pretty hot anyway.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   And obviously you want to be very careful
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   about avoiding all extremes of temperature, cold or hot.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.980]   So if they're going through these 90-minute cycles,
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:52.240]   you're going to have to adjust
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.800]   to those 90-minute cycles as well.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:55.800]   So then people say, well, that's not going to help me at all
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.280]   because how do I deal with the fact
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.440]   that I need to be up every 90 minutes at night?
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:02.160]   There are a couple tools that can be helpful.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.440]   The first one is going to be
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.100]   to try and understand the relationship
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:09.640]   between calm and deep sleep.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:12.860]   So the autonomic nervous system can put us into states
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:16.700]   of panic where that kind of seesaw of autonomic alertness
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.040]   goes all the way to panic,
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.560]   or it can be alertness or it can be alert and calm, right?
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.040]   So there's a range there.
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.140]   It's a continuum.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:26.040]   It can also be that you're in deep sleep,
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.720]   so the other end of the seesaw is way up,
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.080]   or you're in light sleep, or you're kind of sleepy,
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.140]   or you're just feeling kind of relaxed.
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:36.280]   Perhaps the most important thing
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:39.520]   if you're having to map to a baby's schedule
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.780]   in order to make sure that they're getting changings
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:44.340]   in nursing, et cetera, at the appropriate times,
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:48.360]   is to try and maintain,
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.840]   if you can't sleep or you can't sleep continuously,
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:56.040]   to try and maintain your autonomic nervous system
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:59.340]   in a place where you're not going into heightened states
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:03.100]   of alertness when you would ideally be sleeping.
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:05.920]   Now, I realize that this could be translated
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.880]   to try and stay calm while you're sleep deprived,
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.000]   which is very hard for people to do,
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.920]   but this is where the non-sleep deep breath protocol
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:16.120]   surface again and can potentially be very beneficial
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.940]   for people to be able to recover, not necessarily sleep,
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:22.360]   but for them to maintain a certain amount
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.980]   of autonomic regulation.
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.060]   So what would this look like?
[01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:27.200]   This would look like a baby goes down,
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:29.560]   maybe it's only going to go down for 45 minutes.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.440]   If you can capture sleep,
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.640]   capture sleep, there are some data showing
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:35.960]   what's called polyphasic sleep.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.980]   If you can sleep in 45 minute increments or batches,
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.620]   even if it's spread throughout the day
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:42.120]   with periods of wakefulness in between,
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.240]   as miserable as that sound,
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.140]   there are actually some adults
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:46.080]   that have deliberately employed that
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.260]   who don't have children for sake of work productivity.
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.880]   And it does tend to reduce the total overall amount
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.540]   of sleep that you need.
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:55.780]   It is a very hard schedule for most people to maintain,
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.540]   but if you have a baby, the baby may be throwing you
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:58.840]   into that kind of schedule anyway.
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:02.040]   So if you can get 45 minutes sleep while they sleep, great.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.960]   If you can get another 45 minutes after waking
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.800]   and then they go back down to sleep, great.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.800]   So as many phases of sleep as you can get,
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.600]   but if you can't sleep,
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:12.480]   the data on non-sleep deep rest type protocols
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.460]   does show that at least from a neurochemical level,
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:16.820]   want to be clear what that means,
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:20.440]   reset of things like dopamine levels in the basal ganglia
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.800]   measured by things like positron emission tomography,
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:26.640]   et cetera, those things tend to reset themselves pretty well
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.140]   if you can access these deep rest states.
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:32.280]   So that means not being alert
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.200]   throughout the entire time that the baby is sleeping,
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:37.420]   trying to sort of mirror the baby's sleep cycle,
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:39.040]   which can be brutal for certain people.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.820]   And especially if you're trying to prepare meals
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:41.660]   and do all these things.
[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.380]   So I do recognize that there are a lot of constraints
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:44.560]   on parenting, not just mapping
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.360]   on your baby's sleep schedule.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:50.960]   As children approach ages one, two, three, four,
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:54.440]   that's when certainly the optics of the eyes have improved,
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:56.440]   but you don't want to damage the eyes, of course,
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:57.960]   with very bright light.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.600]   They are much more sensitive
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.940]   even until they're kind of 10, 11 years old.
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:06.440]   And we'll talk about vision in children in a moment,
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:10.980]   but trying to get longer and longer batches of sleep
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:13.240]   through, hopefully not through the use
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.420]   of administering melatonin to the kids,
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:17.740]   'cause that's what I talked about before,
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:19.540]   why that could potentially be detrimental.
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:21.100]   Talk about that with your doctor.
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:25.840]   But more so trying to get longer blocks of sleep
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.980]   that map onto these ultradian cycles.
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:30.580]   So it would be better off to get a three hour,
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:32.060]   like two 90 minute cycles,
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:34.240]   than a four hour batch of sleep
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.820]   because waking up in the middle of those ultradian cycles
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:39.440]   can just be brutal for parent and kid.
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.800]   So if one can't get a full six or 10
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.620]   or some kids should even be sleeping 12 hours
[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:45.800]   when they're growing quickly,
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.900]   trying to get batches of sleep,
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:51.020]   even if they're fractured throughout the 24 hour cycle,
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:53.980]   that are matched more to these 90 minute cycles,
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:56.620]   meaning maybe one ultradian cycle of 90 minutes
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:01.060]   or two back-to-back or three back-to-back-to-back,
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:02.020]   that's going to be better
[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.240]   than waking up in the middle of an ultradian cycle.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.860]   It's just going to set any number of other things
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:10.740]   in a better direction than were you to try to say,
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:15.020]   just enforce or force a full eight or 10 hours of sleep.
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:17.380]   That's at least what the literature shows.
[01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:19.160]   Some kids sleep great through the night,
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.920]   starting at a very young age, others don't.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:22.420]   I typically hear from people
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:24.320]   who are struggling tremendously.
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:26.320]   They're losing their mind, understandably,
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:29.480]   because they're not sleeping, their kid's not sleeping,
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.280]   or their kid is sleeping for such brief periods.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.660]   So in other words, try and access deep calm
[01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:34.500]   if you can't sleep.
[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:35.900]   Try and access sleep if you can sleep,
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.220]   even if it's fractured.
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:39.440]   And then you say, well, what about all the sunlight viewing
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.700]   and the exercise stuff?
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:45.940]   When sleep is really, really dismantled,
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:49.420]   meaning it's happening in various times of day or night,
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:52.600]   that's especially, at those times,
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.960]   it's going to be especially important for the parent
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.620]   to get morning and evening sunlight
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:59.680]   because your circadian clock is going into a tailspin
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.720]   and it basically wants to anchor to something.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:02.900]   So you want to give it two anchors,
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:05.320]   morning and evening light, okay?
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.560]   So this is rather different
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.180]   than what I described for shift work.
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:10.780]   This is when things are really chaotic
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:12.060]   and you're just not able to sleep.
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.600]   Similar circumstances can arise
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.500]   if you're taking care of a very sick loved one,
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:16.840]   you're up all night.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.420]   Try and stay calm using NSDR protocols.
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:22.620]   I know it's harder to do than to say,
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:24.900]   but those protocols are there, they're free.
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:26.620]   There's research to support them.
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:28.620]   Try and get sleep whenever you can,
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:31.900]   but also try to get morning sunlight
[01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:34.180]   and evening sunlight in your eyes if you can.
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:37.580]   And if you can't get that, use artificial light, okay?
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:39.940]   What about later life?
[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:42.160]   So kids now, adolescents, teens,
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.260]   it is true that teens have a tendency to wake up later
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:47.700]   and go to sleep later.
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:50.560]   In part, just because they're sleeping a lot more,
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.780]   they're churning out gonadotropin-releasing hormone
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:56.340]   and luteinizing hormone, their whole bodies are changing.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:58.420]   I don't know whether or not people realize this,
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:00.460]   but the fastest rate of aging
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:03.480]   that any of us will ever undergo is puberty.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:06.060]   That is the fastest rate of aging.
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:08.620]   And so there's a huge number of biological processes
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.140]   that are happening during puberty.
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:12.180]   Probably devote a whole episode to,
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:16.660]   puberty is a fascinating aspect to the life course,
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:19.360]   but it is an accelerated period of aging.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.460]   And the circadian clock mechanisms
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:24.500]   sometimes are very intact
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.920]   and sometimes they're a little dismantled
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:27.700]   and going through some change,
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:31.260]   but prioritize the duration of sleep
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:33.020]   for adolescents and teens.
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:34.980]   Now, if that means they're sleeping until 2 p.m.
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:36.680]   and then waking up and then they're up all night,
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.540]   the up all night part can become a problem,
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:41.300]   especially with all the devices texting in their rooms
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:43.220]   or playing video games.
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:45.080]   Morning and evening sunlight would be ideal,
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:46.480]   but some kids are just going to sleep
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.800]   through the morning sunlight.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.640]   However, if you were to measure their temperature,
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.140]   what you would find is that their temperature minimum
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:54.100]   would come later in the morning.
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:57.100]   It's not going to be 8 a.m.,
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:58.640]   it's going to be maybe even 10 a.m.
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:01.200]   if they're sleeping until 11 or 12,
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.860]   or it might be 8 a.m. if they're sleeping until 10.
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:05.500]   Remember, temperature minimum is two hours
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:08.300]   before your average waking time, typically.
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:11.220]   So in teens, it maximizes the total amount of sleep.
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:13.020]   Try and get regular sunlight
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.540]   either in the morning or in the evening or both,
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.240]   but if they're sleeping through the morning sunrise,
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:20.440]   that's probably not as much of an issue.
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:23.360]   Waking them up and depriving them of sleep is probably worse
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:25.740]   because their T-min, their temperature minimum,
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:27.960]   is actually falling later.
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:30.760]   So their circadian dead zone is later, et cetera.
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:32.740]   So I think with adolescents and teens,
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:35.940]   it makes sense to kind of give them a little bit more rope
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:39.060]   in terms of allowing them some leeway
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:40.160]   to adjust their own schedule.
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:42.200]   Some schools are even starting classes later
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:45.080]   on the basis of some very good biology
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.860]   to support this late shifted rhythm
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.500]   and this extended sleep phase.
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:53.220]   There are data from Dr. Jamie Zeitzer,
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:54.860]   Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:57.660]   and others at Stanford showing that turning on the lights
[01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:59.780]   in the room of a teen before they wake up
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:03.660]   helps them get more sleep the subsequent night.
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:05.300]   It also tricks them into going to sleep
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:06.120]   a little bit earlier,
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:09.260]   but it gives them about 45 minutes more of deep sleep,
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:10.980]   and that's been shown statistically.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:13.340]   Total sleep time increases as well.
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:15.140]   If they're hiding under the covers, that's not going to work
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:17.040]   but their eyes don't have to be open.
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.880]   I know a few parents now that are coming in
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:22.760]   with a flashlight and flashing their kids over their eyelids
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:24.940]   before they wake up in hopes of getting this to work.
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:27.320]   Some have told me this is working.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.680]   That's not part of a standard study,
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:35.040]   but it does seem to work because, now you should know why,
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.200]   because if light's getting through the eyelids
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:40.400]   and it's say 8 a.m. and the kid is still asleep
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.800]   and they're going to wake up at 10,
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:44.920]   you're giving them light just after
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:47.340]   or around their temperature minimum,
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:50.120]   which is going to make them want to go to sleep earlier.
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.080]   And in the case of teens, for some reason,
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.620]   we don't quite understand sleep longer,
[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:57.280]   about 45 minutes longer, spend more time in deep sleep.
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.320]   Adults can do this too.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.660]   If you can persuade someone or put your lights on timer
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.960]   for lights to go on before you wake up,
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:06.200]   that's really going to help you wake up earlier, okay?
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.920]   So if you're starting to hear some themes
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:11.160]   are really resounding over and over again,
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:13.360]   that should be reassuring to you, right?
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.740]   These are core mechanisms.
[01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:18.700]   Fortunately, there aren't a thousand different mechanisms.
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:23.260]   Now, in the elderly, there's a real tendency
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:27.300]   to want to go to sleep very early and wake up very early.
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:31.220]   And people should talk to their physician.
[01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:33.820]   There is some evidence that melatonin levels
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:36.180]   and patterns of melatonin secretion
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:39.640]   can become a little chaotic in elderly folks.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:40.660]   What do I mean by elderly?
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:41.540]   Well, it's going to differ.
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:42.980]   Rates of aging differ, right?
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:45.220]   You see some 65-year-olds that are struggling
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:50.060]   to move and seem much older than some 65-year-olds
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:53.540]   that are still hustling around and have tons of energy.
[01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:55.100]   There's a lot of variation.
[01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:57.900]   Some of it's genetic, some of it's lifestyle factors.
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:00.700]   It really varies.
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:03.460]   Certainly lifestyle factors can play an important role
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:04.660]   in rates of aging.
[01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:09.780]   I think that the most prominent results
[01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:12.860]   from sleep and circadian rhythms in the elderly
[01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:15.780]   are they need to get as much natural light,
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:16.940]   even if it's through windows.
[01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:19.180]   I realized that some elderly folks
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.740]   can't get outside as easily.
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:21.980]   It's not safe for them to do it.
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:23.960]   They can't move around as easily.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:26.940]   Exercise can come in various forms
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:29.380]   for people that can't get outside
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:32.100]   and get a ton of sunlight by jogging or cycling.
[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:33.340]   They're not able to do that.
[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:35.820]   Light through a window in that case, open window ideally,
[01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:37.700]   but for temperature reasons, et cetera,
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:39.500]   sometimes the window has to be closed.
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.840]   Getting people near that window
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:43.580]   and away from artificial light early in the day
[01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:46.740]   and away from artificial lights during the night phase
[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:49.440]   can have a tremendous effect.
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.180]   And in the elderly, that's when melatonin
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:55.180]   might be a viable option.
[01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:57.020]   And this should be discussed with a physician, of course,
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:33:00.920]   but you're way past the puberty time point.
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:05.000]   In most cases, people who are in their 70s and 80s and 90s
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000]   are not churning out a lot of GnRH
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.060]   and luteinizing hormone to begin with.
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:11.540]   And that's where struggles with falling asleep
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:14.140]   and staying asleep, all the same parameters
[01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:17.300]   and things we've described before still apply,
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:19.560]   light, exercise, temperature, et cetera,
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:22.960]   but that's where melatonin might be of greatest benefit.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.680]   And again, I'm not pushing melatonin here,
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:26.920]   but I think for elderly folks who are having trouble
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:29.740]   falling and staying asleep, that might be worthwhile.
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:36.000]   I should just also mention that regular schedule
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.400]   for folks that are elderly and as much natural light
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:42.200]   is safely possible, those are going to be the really,
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:46.180]   the key levers for adjusting sleep in circadian schedules.
[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:49.440]   I've mentioned before in previous podcasts,
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.400]   other supplements besides melatonin.
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:55.100]   And some of those supplements are quite good for sleep.
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:56.600]   I'm not a supplement pusher.
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:59.360]   I am somebody who takes supplements.
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.280]   I believe in them.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:03.840]   Some have worked for me, some have not worked as well,
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.800]   but I certainly believe in getting the behaviors right,
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:11.000]   whether or not it's NSDR protocols, viewing natural light,
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.760]   exercise, it's hot baths or cold showers or what have you,
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.120]   behavioral protocols first.
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.160]   There are some supplements
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:20.960]   that I've mentioned in previous podcasts,
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:22.600]   but I've seemed to get a lot of questions about.
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:23.680]   So I just want to take a couple of minutes
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:25.520]   and just talk about some of the supplements
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:29.220]   that can be beneficial for helping turn it off thinking,
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:32.640]   accessing deeper sleep, and even being able
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:33.860]   to compact your sleep schedule
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:35.200]   into a shorter period of hours,
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.600]   meaning getting by well with less sleep.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.560]   People take a lot of sleeping pills.
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:42.280]   I'm not going to tell people not to take sleeping pills.
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.560]   They can be very problematic, habit forming,
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:49.360]   high side effect incidents in many cases.
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:52.000]   Some people can handle them just fine.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.840]   Again, I'm not a physician, I don't prescribe anything,
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:58.240]   a professor, so I profess a lot of things,
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.780]   some of which are my opinion.
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:02.060]   Although if you look at the scientific literature,
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:03.580]   there's some impressive data
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:06.780]   around some non-prescription drug type supplements
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:10.140]   that have fairly high safety margins that you might consider
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:11.900]   but you should talk to your doctor always
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:13.720]   before adding or taking anything
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:15.700]   out of your health regimes, right?
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:17.440]   Your health is not my responsibility,
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:20.200]   it's your responsibility, so be a stringent filter.
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:22.240]   Along those lines, one of the most powerful
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.440]   and useful tools that I've mentioned here on many times
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.560]   and I plan to mention many, many more times
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:29.600]   is the website examine.com,
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.800]   which I have no affiliation with,
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:33.680]   but is a wonderful site that links you
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.820]   to quality peer-reviewed studies
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:38.360]   related to just about any supplement,
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.440]   including some safety warnings.
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:41.940]   We'll also tell you what subjects,
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:45.440]   whether or not it was rats, cats, elderly folks, or kids,
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:47.100]   that a given study was done on,
[01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:49.080]   which is important, can be kind of hard to pull
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:52.480]   from sites where people are just advertising supplements,
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.660]   right, they usually don't tell you what the study was
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:59.120]   and who were these rats, who were these kids, et cetera.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:04.120]   There are three supplements that, at least for me,
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:08.120]   have had a tremendously positive effect on my sleep
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.200]   that some of you might consider.
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:14.840]   I would say if you're doing everything properly,
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:17.200]   behaviorally, and you're still having issues,
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.840]   then supplements might be a good thing for you.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.380]   Or if you are traveling and you want a little bit
[01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:26.200]   of extra help in buffering your sleep wakefulness protocols.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:29.120]   Some people like to go just to the supplements.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:30.060]   They're like, what should I take?
[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:32.040]   I have people in my life that are like,
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:33.200]   just tell me what to take.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:36.000]   I'm more of, here's what you might want to do or not do,
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.520]   but, and then think about what you might want to take
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:42.700]   or not take, but personal preference and it's free country,
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:45.080]   so you can do what you like.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.780]   Magnesium.
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:53.280]   So magnesium has been shown to increase the depth of sleep
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:56.600]   and has been shown to decrease the amount of time
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:59.900]   that it takes to access sleep, to fall asleep.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.640]   It comes in various forms.
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:04.920]   I've talked a bunch of times about magnesium threonate,
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:09.160]   T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate,
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:13.160]   which seems to be the more bioavailable form of magnesium.
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:16.420]   And magnesium threonate, it seems,
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:19.360]   is shuttled preferentially to the brain,
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.880]   which is where you want it.
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:23.640]   And there are certain transporters,
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:26.060]   it actually engages the GABA pathway,
[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:28.300]   which tends to turn off certain areas of the forebrain,
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:30.140]   allows you to fall asleep.
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:34.060]   There is a study, if you would like to explore it,
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:36.500]   since people serious about supplementation
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:38.320]   might want to explore the study,
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:41.020]   which is Ates et al., A-T-E-S,
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:42.560]   dose-dependent absorption profile
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:44.960]   of different magnesium compounds.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:47.960]   Looks to me like a quality peer-reviewed paper.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:50.200]   I can put the link in the caption.
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:52.940]   And it explores all the different forms of magnesium.
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:56.080]   It does seem like magnesium glycinate
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:57.820]   can be similar to magnesium threonate
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:37:59.540]   in terms of which tissues it shuttled to.
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:02.320]   Magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E,
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.500]   is preferentially shuttled to the muscle, it appears,
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:05.340]   as opposed to the brain.
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:08.260]   So it's going to be more of a muscle repair type thing
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:10.800]   or restoring magnesium stores in the periphery
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:11.900]   as opposed to the brain.
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:14.620]   Magnesium citrate has another name
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:17.240]   that I won't mention in jest
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:20.140]   because magnesium citrate's main effect,
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:21.900]   at least on me and the people I know,
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:24.100]   seems to be a laxative effect
[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:25.680]   as opposed to a cognitive effect.
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:27.160]   There's also some evidence
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.880]   that magnesium threonate can be neuroprotective.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:32.380]   Those data come from quality labs,
[01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:34.860]   mostly rodent studies, not human studies,
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:36.160]   but it's kind of interesting.
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.880]   And again, the safety margins for these things
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.180]   tend to be pretty high,
[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:41.040]   but anytime you're going to take something new,
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:42.440]   you should approach it with caution,
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.640]   especially since magnesium could be involved
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:47.320]   in heart rhythm and things of that sort.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:50.480]   The other supplement that has been very beneficial for me
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:55.480]   is theanine, so this is T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine.
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:59.580]   T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E.
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:02.920]   Theanine activates certain GABA pathways,
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.580]   which are involved in turning off,
[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:06.180]   top-down processing and thinking,
[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:08.740]   making it easier to fall asleep.
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:13.400]   And theanine, 100 milligrams to 300 milligrams,
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.100]   has a calming effect.
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:16.300]   Theanine is now showing up
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:19.320]   in a number of different energy drinks
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.940]   and even some coffees as a way to try and get people
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:23.800]   to ingest more of a given type of coffee,
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:26.660]   'cause the idea is it would take away the jitters
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:29.660]   and the anxiety, allowing people to drink more coffee.
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:33.220]   I'm talking about taking magnesium and theanine
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:35.020]   30 to 60 minutes before bedtime,
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:37.540]   not during the day to quell anxiety,
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:40.100]   but rather 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime,
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:43.360]   with or without food for me has made a difference.
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:45.900]   And the combination of those two things has really helped.
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:49.180]   Theanine for sleepwalkers can be a problem.
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:51.600]   It does increase the intensity of your dreams.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.920]   It gives you very vivid dreams.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:56.040]   So for sleepwalkers or people that get night terrors,
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:59.100]   stay away from theanine is my advice.
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.320]   Magnesium, theanine might be something to explore
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.580]   for those of you that don't have those issues,
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:05.540]   with the emphasis on might.
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:07.380]   And then I've talked about a compound,
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:10.560]   and last time I talked about the mechanisms of apigenin,
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:13.880]   which is a derivative of chamomile, API, Gen,
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:16.600]   which acts as a little bit of a hypnotic
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:19.240]   by activating chloride channels, hyperpolarized neurons,
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:20.860]   increases GABA in the brain,
[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:23.720]   basically makes you feel a little sleepy.
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:26.560]   And chamomile, for those of you that read your,
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:31.200]   what was it, Peter Rabbit snuck into Mr. McGregor's garden,
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.720]   ate the chamomile, fell asleep, Mr. McGregor came back.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.920]   Okay, anyone flashing back to elementary school?
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.200]   Okay, there's a story about chamomile
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.000]   having these kind of sedative-like effects.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.480]   Apigenin is highly concentrated.
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:44.500]   Chamomile also has anti-estrogenic effects.
[01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:46.740]   So if you want to keep your estrogen up,
[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:49.140]   you might want to be cautious about apigenin.
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:52.140]   That's where things like examine.com become really useful,
[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:54.540]   because you can go to examine, you put in apigenin,
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:56.220]   and it'll tell you all the things that it does,
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:57.540]   and all the things that it does
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:59.500]   can sometimes include things that you had no idea,
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:04.500]   like reducing conversion of certain androgens to estrogens,
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:07.540]   which you might like, or you might want to avoid.
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:09.660]   That's up to you and where you want your estrogen levels,
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:10.640]   depending on who you are
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:13.240]   and what your life circumstances and goals are.
[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:18.260]   A few other things that can help the transition to sleep
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:20.780]   are things like 5-HTP, L-tryptophan.
[01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:23.780]   I've talked about why I'm not a fan of those for me.
[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:25.700]   They tend to throw me into deep sleep,
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:27.580]   and then I wake up and I can't fall back asleep.
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:30.360]   So I don't like to tinker with my serotonin system.
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.660]   I don't like to tinker with my dopamine system
[01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:34.140]   for entirely other reasons,
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:38.260]   but none of which are particularly concerning.
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:40.340]   It's just that I find that if I increase my dopamine
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:43.000]   by taking L-tyrosine in pill form,
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.640]   then I crash really hard the next day.
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:47.000]   Or if I take 5-HTP or L-tryptophan,
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.720]   I fall deeply asleep and then I wake up.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:51.880]   But I did mention that there might be ways
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.840]   to make sleep more compact.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:56.160]   And so this is actually a request to you.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:00.000]   I had a really interesting experience when I was a postdoc.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.880]   I went for the first time to an acupuncturist.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:05.760]   I know there are varying thoughts and opinions out there
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:06.880]   about acupuncture.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:11.000]   I can't say that I benefited so much from the acupuncture.
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:14.820]   There are now quality peer-reviewed studies
[01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:17.400]   published in Neuron, cell press journal, excellent journal,
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:20.280]   showing that acupuncture can stimulate
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:22.580]   some anti-inflammatory compounds
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:24.080]   depending on where the acupuncture is done.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.340]   This is a really good study.
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:26.300]   It came out last year.
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:27.460]   I talked about this on Instagram.
[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:28.700]   I may talk about it again.
[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:30.900]   As well as certain acupuncture sites
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:32.580]   that increase inflammation.
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:36.480]   So you can get different types of effects.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:39.460]   You can't just say acupuncture is great across the board.
[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:41.880]   And I'm assuming that the acupuncturists know
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:43.760]   which sites are good for increasing inflammation,
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:46.640]   which ones are good for decreasing inflammation.
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:50.400]   However, this acupuncturist that I went to
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:52.040]   gave me these red pills.
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:53.800]   He said, "These are minerals for sleep."
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:54.660]   And it was remarkable.
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:56.240]   I took the red pills.
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:57.280]   Isn't that a thing now?
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:58.100]   Take the red pill.
[01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:00.760]   I don't know what that means because I'm not tuned in.
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:03.360]   But these red pills look like little M&Ms.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.440]   I took a couple of them on his suggestion.
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:07.960]   And I fell deeply asleep and four hours later
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:09.920]   woke up feeling incredibly rested,
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:12.000]   more rested than I had ever felt in my entire life.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.940]   And I never required more than four hours sleep.
[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:16.240]   Unfortunately, acupuncturist moved away.
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.560]   I never figured out what was in those red pills.
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:20.880]   I didn't get a chance to do the mass spectroscopy.
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:24.000]   And I still wonder, he said they were minerals.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.360]   So somebody out there knows what these red pills are
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.600]   and what this compound is.
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:30.920]   And it was incredible.
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:33.640]   And I would love to know what those are.
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:37.440]   So if you know, please don't go taking red pills at random
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:41.880]   to try and recreate this non-experiment experience of mine.
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:44.940]   But please do contact me if you find out
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:46.040]   or if you're an acupuncturist
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:48.560]   and you know what these mysterious red pills were
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:51.760]   because they were pretty awesome.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:53.520]   Once again, I've thrown a tremendous amount
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.640]   of information at you.
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:58.180]   I hope you will figure out your temperature minimum
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:02.200]   and start working with that to access the sleep
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:04.820]   and wakeful cycles that you want to access.
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:07.420]   I hope that you'll explore NSDR.
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:10.580]   You might want to explore supplementation
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:11.900]   if that's your thing.
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:14.920]   You have now access to a lot of mechanism
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:16.640]   about sleep and wakefulness.
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:18.580]   But in keeping with the theme of this podcast
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:21.220]   where we stay on topic for an entire month
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:22.520]   or even slightly more,
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:24.920]   we are not done with sleep and wakefulness.
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.720]   I know this is very different
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:28.240]   than the typical podcast format
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:31.500]   where one week it's how to become superhuman
[01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:34.700]   and the next week it's how to, you know,
[01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:35.840]   develop growth mindset.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.080]   It's kind of all over the place with episode to episode.
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.900]   We are staying on track because I really believe
[01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:43.720]   that as we drill deeper and deeper into these mechanisms
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:45.600]   and you start hearing some of the same themes
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:46.840]   again and again,
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:49.360]   you're going to start to develop an intuition
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:51.700]   and an understanding of how these systems work in you
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:53.760]   and your particular life circumstances.
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:56.800]   And my goal is really to eventually become obsolete.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.620]   It's what my graduate advisor used to call
[01:44:58.620 --> 01:45:00.800]   the hit by a bus principle.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:03.620]   She had a somewhat morbid sense of humor
[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:05.620]   and it used to be, well, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow,
[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:09.200]   what are you going to do without me blabbing at you here?
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.400]   So I don't want to get hit by a bus.
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.000]   I plan on living a very long time
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.840]   if I have anything to say about it,
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:17.640]   but were I to get hit by a bus tomorrow,
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.920]   what would you do for your sleep and wakefulness, right?
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:22.440]   You could put a comment on YouTube, which I hope you'll do,
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.080]   but if I were hit by a bus and killed,
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.800]   then I wouldn't be able to answer your question.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:29.720]   So know your temperature minimum.
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:32.840]   Understand light in the early part of the day is valuable.
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:34.000]   Light when you want to be awake,
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.640]   provided it's not so bright, it's damaging.
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.340]   It's great for you whether or not it comes from screens
[01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:39.340]   or sunlight, but sunlight's better.
[01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:42.200]   Avoid light in the four to six hours
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:43.560]   before your temperature minimum
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.000]   or else you're going to delay your clock
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.600]   unless you're traveling and that's what you want to do, okay?
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:51.980]   Use temperature, increase temperature to shift your clock.
[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:56.160]   Decrease temperature to delay your clock, okay?
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:58.120]   Map out your temperature and understand it.
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:00.960]   You don't have to know degree by degree across the day.
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:03.040]   Know your minimum, know your maximum temperature
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:04.200]   in your 24-hour cycle
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:07.120]   and you will feel great power through that
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:10.600]   because then you'll know also about these ultradian cycles,
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:13.360]   these 90-minute cycles within which you can do focused work.
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:15.000]   Don't expect the focus to come early.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.120]   Expect the focus to come in the middle
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:18.120]   and then kind of taper off.
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:19.240]   Talked a little bit about kids,
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:21.100]   a little bit about elderly, about parenting.
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:22.160]   We are going to continue.
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:25.680]   There's going to be more, but now shift workers, travelers,
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:27.760]   people that are jet-lacking themselves at home,
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:30.580]   you now have levers in place.
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:31.980]   Information can be powerful,
[01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:34.360]   but you have to implement it in ways,
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:36.460]   obviously safe ways and reasonable ways,
[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:38.460]   but implementing this knowledge
[01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:41.320]   in the ways that you trust are safe and reasonable for you
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:43.420]   is going to be the way that you can develop
[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:45.560]   a bit of a laboratory about yourself.
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:47.740]   I loathe the term biohacking.
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:49.080]   Sorry, biohackers.
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:50.660]   I don't believe in hacking anything.
[01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:52.240]   I believe in understanding mechanism
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:54.380]   and applying the principles of mechanism
[01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:58.320]   for which there are large bodies of quality peer-reviewed data
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.800]   and even a whole center of mass around
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:03.320]   certain biological principles like the effects of light
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:06.040]   and temperature minimums that will allow you
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:08.440]   to shift your biology in the ways that you want it to go,
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:10.420]   that will allow you to shift your psychology
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:12.520]   in the ways you want it to go.
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:14.560]   Next podcast episode,
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:17.820]   we are going to talk more about a few things.
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:20.120]   First of all, we're going to answer more of your questions
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:21.240]   'cause during office hours,
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.480]   I didn't get to all your questions
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:24.600]   from the previous episode.
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:27.720]   So I do read the comments and we're paying attention
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:29.680]   to figuring out the most common questions.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:31.360]   We are going to get to some of the harder topics.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.380]   Someone came at me.
[01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:33.840]   It's always fun when somebody does this and they say,
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:35.680]   "Well, these are just the kind of
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:36.900]   "basal low-level questions.
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:37.940]   "What about the big stuff?
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:40.560]   "What about dreaming and lucid dreaming and consciousness?"
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:42.420]   Look, I'll talk about that stuff.
[01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:44.160]   And I'm planning to do that,
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.360]   some of which in the next episode
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.340]   and the following episode, maybe even.
[01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:49.880]   But I want to give you data.
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:52.320]   I want to give you things that are supported by data.
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:56.680]   So I will try to speculate as little as possible
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:59.040]   because this is a podcast about science
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:01.160]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:03.740]   This is not about me speculating.
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:04.840]   Many people have speculated
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.800]   about the role of sleep, dreaming, and consciousness.
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:11.160]   Fascinating topics and a rather circular argument, frankly.
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:12.800]   It's been going on for centuries.
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:14.080]   Someday we'll get there.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:15.300]   Right now, we're concentrating
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:17.020]   on these deep biological mechanisms
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:18.400]   that make you who you are
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:21.460]   and allow you to feel certain ways, good or bad,
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:25.040]   allow you to function physically in certain ways,
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:27.700]   good or bad, and give you more of a sense of control.
[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:29.200]   That's my goal here.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:31.220]   Many people have quite graciously asked
[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:33.800]   how they can help support the podcast.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.000]   First of all, thank you.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.780]   We appreciate the question.
[01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:38.360]   You can support the podcast
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:41.620]   by subscribing to the podcast on YouTube,
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:45.040]   as well as subscribing on Apple or Spotify.
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:47.280]   And you can also leave us comments
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.320]   and feedback on YouTube and at Apple.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:51.480]   That really helps.
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:53.300]   We would hope the feedback would be positive,
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:56.140]   but nonetheless, leave us feedback, ask questions.
[01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:57.480]   We will use those questions
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:00.280]   to create future content for the podcast.
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:02.120]   As well, if you can recommend the podcast
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:03.880]   to friends and family and other people
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:05.780]   that you think might find the information of use,
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:07.020]   that's terrific.
[01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:08.420]   And check out our sponsors
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:10.040]   that we mentioned at the beginning.
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:12.500]   That's a really great way to help support us
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:15.020]   and our ability to bring you this information.
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:17.720]   Along those lines, a lot of people have asked me
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:21.480]   about supplements and supplement companies.
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:25.380]   So up until now, I've been reluctant
[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:27.760]   to recommend specific supplement brands.
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:30.980]   The supplement industry is kind of a Wild West
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:33.600]   of different brands, different levels of quality
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.280]   and stringency.
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:37.080]   It can be very complicated.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:40.040]   And what's on the bottle is not always what you're getting.
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:41.400]   The quality of what you're getting
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:42.900]   varies from company to company
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:45.980]   and even from substance to substance, batch to batch.
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:49.980]   So I'm pleased to say that I'm partnering with Thorne.
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:53.140]   Thorne, spelled T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:56.820]   is a supplement company that works with the Mayo Clinic
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:50:00.140]   and with pretty much all the major sports team organizations
[01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:03.660]   and that I know to have the highest levels of stringency
[01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:05.920]   in terms of what's in the bottle,
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:08.680]   matches what's listed on the bottle,
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:10.020]   and in terms of the quality
[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:12.180]   of what they put in those supplements.
[01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:14.460]   So while I mentioned earlier
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:16.180]   that supplements aren't for everybody,
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:18.340]   if you're interested in trying some of these supplements,
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:20.140]   you might want to check out Thorne.
[01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:20.980]   If you want to do that,
[01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:25.980]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:31.740]   So it's T-H-O-R-N-E.com,
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:36.020]   C-O-M/u/huberman.
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:38.720]   And if you do that, they'll give you 20% off
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:39.740]   any of the supplements
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:42.040]   that you happen to purchase from Thorne.
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:43.660]   Thanks so much for your time and attention.
[01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:45.020]   I really appreciate it.
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:47.820]   See you next time on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:50.600]   And as always, thanks for your interest in science.
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:53.180]   (upbeat music)
[01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:55.760]   (upbeat music)
