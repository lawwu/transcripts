[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Pastor John, as you know, Jeremiah 29 11 is a favorite passage for a lot of Christians.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   It's one of the most popular verses in the Bible, and it reads like this, quote,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   to give you a future and a hope," end quote.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Pastor John, can a Christian legitimately lay claim of an Old Testament promise like this one?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Why or why not?
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Yes, Christians can lay claim to this, and they do it because of Christ.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   And here's the way I see it fitting together.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   That promise was spoken by God through Jeremiah in Jeremiah 29.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Explicitly it says, "To the exiles in Babylon."
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   If you start reading at the beginning of the chapter, they're in Babylon.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Seventy years is going to pass, but a hope and a future are coming for them.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And so we Christians, we Gentiles especially, go to it, and we love it
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   because it holds out the prospect of not destruction for us, but life and hope and joy in the future.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Now, the reason we can do it is because at the Last Supper, Jesus lifted up the cup,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   which represented his blood, and he said, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood."
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And when he said that, he meant, "When I die tomorrow morning and shed my blood on behalf of my people,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I am securing for them all the new covenant promises that God has made."
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Everything that God meant to be fulfilled for his people Israel,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   now is going to be fulfilled in his people of the new covenant,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   so that not only Jews, but also Gentiles, through faith in the Messiah,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   become part of the covenant people of God,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   so that every promise can be laid hold on by Gentiles who are in the Messiah, in Christ Jesus.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And we know that because in 2 Corinthians 1, verse 20, Paul says,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   "All the promises of God are yes in Christ Jesus."
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And I think that's what's behind Romans 8, 32,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   will he not with him, because of that sacrifice, give us all things freely?"
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And that would include all the promises that God made to his covenant people.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   So there is an understanding of the flow of redemptive history that comes to a climax in Jesus,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   purchasing for all those who are in him as the head of this new covenant people,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   the promises of the Old Testament.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   So I love the verse, and I lay hold on it as a "Johnny-come-lately" Gentile,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   and I believe Christ has warranted that for me.
