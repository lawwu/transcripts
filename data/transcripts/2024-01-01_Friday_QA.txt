[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.240]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, it's a live Q&A.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.040]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.380]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.380]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.380]   I am your host.
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.800]   It is Monday, January 1, 2024, the first live Q&A show of the new year.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.260]   Kicking it off in style.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:50.640]   Thank you for being here with me.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.640]   Each and every Friday here at Radical Personal Finance, when I am able to arrange the technology,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.200]   we normally do live Q&A.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.060]   Those live Q&A shows are available generally to patrons of the show, but I decided to kick
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.860]   off the show with a special â€“ kick off the new year with a special live Q&A show, something
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.080]   that I really enjoy doing.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.600]   It makes it easy for me.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.600]   You guys call me up.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.100]   You talk to me about such interesting things, bring up all kinds of interesting topics and
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.100]   I love doing it.
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.420]   So if you'd like to join me for one of these future shows, please make sure to become a
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.500]   patron of the show.
[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.420]   You can become a patron at patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.680]   To begin with Hadi in Texas, Hadi, welcome to the show, or is it Hadi or Harry?
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.680]   >> Hari.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.680]   >> Okay.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.680]   It says H-A-R-I.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.680]   So I figured it was probably a Hadi.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.680]   Hadi, welcome.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.680]   How can I serve you today?
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.600]   >> Thank you so much, Joshua.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.500]   Everyone is happy to have someone in their life and I'm happy to have you in my life
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.240]   because you have pretty much influenced many things in my life.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.320]   Thank you for referring to the math academy and we are using that.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.320]   >> Wonderful.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.960]   Thank you so much.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.120]   >> My age is 49, my wife is 47, I have two kids, 17 and 14.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.160]   Our income is about $300,000 per year.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.960]   We have a net worth of $2.3 million, roughly split into a million in real estate, a million
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.800]   in 401k, 200k in 529 college savings, 100k in CDs and brokerage.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.200]   I max out 401k and HSA.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.120]   Our monthly expense is about $5,000.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.760]   What should I do with my surplus income?
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.760]   We live in Texas.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.680]   >> How much is the total surplus income right now if you continue to do all of those things?
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.880]   >> Yeah, probably $8,000 to $9,000 a month.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.800]   >> What are your goals?
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   What do you want to do?
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.520]   Like, why would you invest into anything?
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.080]   What are you trying to accomplish with your money?
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.920]   >> I'm not trying to accomplish anything.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.480]   Everything I want is already there in my life, so there's nothing more I want.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.320]   There's nothing more I need.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:58.560]   And I'm not a big fan of charity, so I'm not passionate about it, I would say that.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.680]   So the extra income is just going to be accumulating.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.880]   >> Do you want to retire at some point?
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.160]   >> I mean, I can do whatever I would do in retirement today.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.440]   My workload is very minimal.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.760]   I could watch movies, sleep during the day.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.320]   I could do whatever I want during the day.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:30.280]   So it's not something -- there's no constraint in my life right now that I have to leave
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.800]   my job to go somewhere.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.520]   Plus, my kids are still studying, so I have to be in a school district that they are used
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.160]   to.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.640]   >> Your wife is not currently earning an income, is that correct?
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.720]   >> She's also working.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.480]   So it's two of us working.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.160]   >> And does she want to retire?
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   >> Nope.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.480]   >> She's also satisfied with her work life?
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.440]   >> Yeah, it's not any pressure.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.160]   Life is good.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.520]   >> What you choose to invest in is going to be determined by what you're trying to accomplish.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.200]   And so you're already using all of the standard financial models, all the standard accounts,
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.960]   401ks, 529s, et cetera, and you have everything squared away.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.600]   To me, the biggest thing -- and if you continue on this pathway, you continue earning the
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   way you're earning, you continue investing the way that you're investing, then you will
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.880]   continue to accumulate a significant amount of money in the fullness of time.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.560]   The first thing to pay attention to is the ages of your children.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.600]   They are currently 17 and 14.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.340]   And there are two aspects to the age of children that I think are really important to pay attention
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.340]   to.
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.040]   Number one, very soon you will no longer have minor children, which means very soon the
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.800]   relationship with your children will change dramatically.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.960]   And I really believe that one of your primary focuses should be to maximize the relationship
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.340]   with your children.
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.200]   And if you can spend money on that profitably, that's something that you should do.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.800]   It may be that you were very frugal in the past and you didn't do a lot, you didn't spend
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.760]   a lot, et cetera, but now you have more resources, and so investing into your relationship with
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.360]   your children, to me, seems like a very smart way to invest money.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.700]   If that means spending more money on, you know, fancy international travel, buying more
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.520]   toys that you can enjoy together, to me, that's some of the best money you're ever going to
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.880]   spend.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.280]   You know, I like -- there's a YouTube channel that I enjoy called Wrangler Star.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.280]   Wrangler Star is this guy.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.280]   His name is Cody.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.840]   He's out in Washington area, in Washington state.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.360]   And what's interesting is that Cody started with nothing, and then over time he made it
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.840]   big on YouTube, now has lots of money from his YouTube business, et cetera.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.480]   But I really admire how he's done a good job of spending money to cultivate his relationship
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.480]   with his son.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.280]   And specifically what he's done is he cultivated things like motor sports.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.360]   So for a time it was off-road motorcycles, then it became snow biking.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.240]   And he has spent and spends enormous amounts of money to have these fancy motorcycles that
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.320]   he rides with his son, and these fancy snow bikes, and they go off and they enjoy it together.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.760]   And I'm using that as a metaphor to say that if I've got a 17-year-old and a 14-year-old
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.360]   and I've got money, then I'm going to say how can -- first, before anything else, I'm
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.520]   going to say first and foremost, how can I spend money on activities that will make it
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:34.000]   really productive for me to hang out with my children and to invest into that relationship?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.360]   Because four or five years from now, your 17-year-old will be 22, 23, probably be more
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.840]   engaged with career, probably be more engaged with his own goals, et cetera, and you'll
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.200]   want to have that time back.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.560]   But with a 17-year-old and a 14-year-old, the actual activities that you do are something
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.160]   that you'll want to actually do something.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.040]   It's not like when you're seven and, "Hey, let's just hang around the house."
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.620]   You want to actually spend money doing something.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.000]   So that's the first thing I would focus on, because 10 years from now, you're not going
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.540]   to have those same opportunities.
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.880]   Related to that, I think it's really important to build a vision for your family and say,
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.440]   how can I spend money profitably on this long-term vision for my family?
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.960]   And so I released a podcast episode, can't remember if it was this year or last, but
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.440]   basically on why a vacation home may be a really great investment into your family.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.480]   And I wholeheartedly believe that that is something that most people should consider.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:37.960]   So being frugal and just having one home may not develop as much of the relationships and
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.920]   the environment that you want as if you go ahead and purchase a second home and make
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.840]   it a second home that's really nice, really convenient, et cetera.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.040]   Now in terms of investing into your children, I think this is also something that you could
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.360]   spend money on to help them.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:01.240]   And so one of my ambitions as a father is to make certain that I have the basic infrastructure
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:07.240]   in our home and in our lifestyle to help support my children's social lives.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.120]   Because the friends that they have and the relationships that they build will be very,
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.280]   very useful to them.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.880]   But if they don't feel like they have the basic infrastructure to support that, then
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.080]   they may not be as socially competent or as socially fulfilled as they otherwise could
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.080]   be.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.160]   So a simple example is that when I was younger, one of my close friends, his family had a
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.160]   theater room.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.960]   It wasn't as fancy as you might see in a Rob Report special that didn't have theater chairs,
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   et cetera.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:43.500]   It had a big couch, a set-aside room, a big couch, and basically a projector on a 20-to-25-foot
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.260]   screen onto the wall, and then a nice surround sound system.
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:56.720]   But because he had that basic infrastructure, then his house was the go-to place for us
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.120]   to go and watch movies.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:03.000]   It was always the house because of this 25-foot screen and nice surround sound system.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.360]   And for young people, having your house that's the destination is really, really helpful
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.240]   to support your social life.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.960]   And then for you as a parent, it's really helpful for you as a parent because now you
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.960]   can get to know your children's friends very well.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.240]   You're not isolated from them.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.160]   You're very involved in what's going on, and I think that's a really great structure for
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.160]   life.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.040]   The same friend also had a private water ski lake outside of the house, a ski boat, et
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.040]   cetera.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.440]   And those things create really good, useful ways to build relationships.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.280]   So if you don't currently have a water ski boat or a wakeboard boat, if you don't currently
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:48.200]   have a really great game room at home and a really awesome system for your children
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   to play the kinds of games or watch movies or whatever the kinds of activities that they're
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.600]   into, then that would be the first thing that I would look at in terms of investing into
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.600]   your children.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.000]   Now related to that, I think, so I guess, excuse me, first it was experiences with you
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.560]   together, second into their social life.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.120]   Third would be that I think you should invest into them directly, but not strictly into
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.400]   the college environment.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   And so the big imbalance that I see all the time is that people have a 529 account, and
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.120]   they think that successfully graduating from college is going to be the thing that launches
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.680]   their children's success.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.800]   But a lot of times spending more money on other things to support them, encourage them
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.920]   in their areas of interest, and to encourage them to go far and wide, to build independence
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.120]   at an early age, that's going to be a really great move.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:40.720]   Now pivoting from that, there are two basic ideas, two different paths that you go down
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.600]   with long-term financial planning.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.720]   The first path is the path of hedonistic consumption.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:51.080]   And so you start to increase your personal consumption to a higher level that matches
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.880]   your current income.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.880]   Based upon what you've said so far, I doubt that's going to be a good fit for you.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.040]   However, the other path you also kind of discounted, you said the charitable path.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.120]   But I would say that I don't like the word charity very much, because I think that undersells
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.040]   the basic concept.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.800]   You may not like giving money away because you don't like some of the organizations that
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.120]   have so far requested your money.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.240]   But I don't know that that absolves you from being interested in the thing that's probably
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.720]   the biggest long-term passion for you.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:29.040]   If you can find a particular area of interest, a particular problem that you want to solve,
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.280]   then to me, that's where you should be investing your money.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.880]   And I believe, I'm not going to take you through that process here in the context of this particular
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.880]   public call, but what I would say is that over the coming years, especially as your
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.240]   children start to be grown, et cetera, you and your wife should identify a list of things
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.080]   that you believe are wrong in the world, some things that you would like to change.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.080]   And then you should start to involve yourselves in a process of engaging with those particular
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.260]   issues, finding out what other people who also want to change those things in the world
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.560]   are doing, and then start to get involved and put your money behind it and invest into
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.240]   changing some aspect of the world that we live in.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.200]   Because that is going to bring you a tremendous amount of joy, a tremendous amount of fulfillment,
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.520]   and a tremendous amount of focus for your money.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.440]   From what you've described, just accumulating more money so you can increase your consumption
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:27.040]   is not probably, for you personally, a pathway towards enjoyment and happiness, but everyone
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.320]   has something they would like to see change in the world.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.160]   And putting money behind that will probably be your most fruitful long-term endeavor and
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.400]   a good way to use up some of the extra millions that you will undoubtedly acquire.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.420]   So those would be the four basic things that I would suggest that you think about at this
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.420]   stage of life.
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.420]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.420]   My pleasure.
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.420]   Anything else real quick?
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.420]   That's all.
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   Thank you.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.420]   Good.
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.420]   Congratulations on all your success.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.420]   Keep up the good work.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.420]   We go to Jeff in Georgia.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.420]   Jeff, welcome to the show.
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.420]   How can I serve you today?
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.420]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.420]   Happy New Year.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.420]   And to you?
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.420]   I'm a healthy 35-year-old, and I kind of see myself being single probably for kind of the
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.420]   majority of my life.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.420]   And just due to the fact that a lot of the advice out there is kind of for families or
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.420]   for people who are going through a difficult time in their lives, I don't think I'm going
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.420]   to be single for the rest of my life.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.420]   But I think I'm going to be single for the rest of my life.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.420]   So I'm going to be single for the rest of my life.
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:26.420]   You didn't say the rest of your life.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.420]   You said the majority of your life.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.420]   Tell me what you mean by that.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.420]   Well, you know, I think a lot of young men my age may claim that they will be single
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.420]   for the rest of their lives.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:46.100]   But I don't want to be so closed-minded that it couldn't happen.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.100]   Okay.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:52.280]   And I know that I'm probing a little bit, but it's important that I understand why you
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:58.280]   are making this choice in order that I could guide the answer to your question.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:03.540]   What is it about singleness that is particularly appealing to you?
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.020]   I enjoy the flexibility of it.
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:12.100]   I have a lot of friends who kind of live a single lifestyle and, you know, it's been
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:17.740]   fun to travel with them and, you know, just kind of see parts of the world.
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.940]   So I guess predominantly, again, sort of the fact that I found some folks with similar
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:28.620]   values and really sort of a desire to kind of do some long-term travel.
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.620]   Okay.
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.620]   You're 35 years old.
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.620]   How much do you earn?
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.920]   About $80,000.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.300]   And ballpark, your current net worth is?
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:44.580]   I have quite a bit of debt, so I'm roughly, you know, negative $100,000.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.660]   Okay.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:51.820]   So the first thing, I'll answer your question, but I would be lying to you if I didn't start
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:15:01.180]   by just mentioning the singleness factor because I have known a small number of people who
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.780]   chose to be single, chose not to have children, and at the end of their life, that seems to
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.220]   have been the right decision for them.
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:15.980]   So I do not deny that there are people in the world in whichâ€”for whom that particular
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.340]   decision may not be the right decision.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:24.660]   However, I don't think that most of the people who pursue that, who do it for the purposes
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:29.320]   of, say, hedonistic consumption, which is basically what you're describing, meaning
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.380]   I like my freedom, I like my flexibility, I want to be able to travel, I want to do
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:38.280]   long-term travel, etc., I don't think that really endures for very long.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:44.380]   And I think the people who seem to meâ€”and this is purely from my own personal experience,
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.660]   I couldn't cite any data, I don't know if any social scientists have dug into this questionâ€”but
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:55.460]   the people who seem to me to be the most satisfied with this particular decision are those who
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:16:01.500]   have made it because it freed them up to do something that was important to them.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:07.780]   So the most obvious example is that I have known priests who took vows of celibacy, I've
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:14.260]   known Christian preachers who took the encouragement of the Apostle Paul in the New Testament who
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:20.740]   said that basically that if you are single, you're more free to serve God, you're more
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.580]   available to do that kind of work more effectively.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:31.140]   And those people, because of that decision, have often seemed to be quite content.
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:39.900]   They made a specific choice, and they said, "I'm going to be single so that I can dedicate
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:45.300]   my life to the kingdom of God, I'm going to take a vow of singleness so that I can contribute
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.420]   my life's energy to this particular cause."
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:55.700]   I've interacted with a few people who didn't have children who seemed to really take pleasure
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:03.500]   in that decision from a personal consumption perspective, but they weren't generally single.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.180]   And so they had a relationship that provided them with romantic companionship, it provided
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:13.380]   them with the basic comfort of having another person whom they loved in their life, but
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.500]   they didn't want the hassle of children.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.860]   And so I think there's a higher percentage of people who are content with that decision
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:23.500]   than who are content with just singleness.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.640]   And I'm assuming that also included in singleness, you don't wish to have children.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.780]   That's not always the assumption.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.180]   I have interacted, especially over the last couple years, with a lot of women who are
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:38.160]   single women who are choosing to have children, but not to have a relationship with a man,
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.120]   but they still want to have children.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.420]   But I didn't hear that in what you said, so I'm assuming that you also, by single you
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.940]   also mean I don't want to have children.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.980]   The narrowest one, however, is the guys who say, "Well, I just like being by myself and
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.100]   I don't ever want to have anyone involved in my life."
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:58.100]   And there seems to come a turning point when you become old where you look back and you
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.260]   say, "Was that really the right decision?"
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:05.540]   And again, I'm not denying that some people could find that to be the case, but in my
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:11.300]   own personal life, I have found that a lot of those guys start to want something different
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.700]   at the end of their life.
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.540]   The problem is that it's just infinitely more difficult to have something different at the
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.900]   end of their life than it is in the prime of your life.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:30.060]   So think very carefully about that decision, and then also assess how much your actions
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:36.460]   would change based upon how committed you are to your philosophy versus how committed
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.660]   you are to what you've done just simply because you haven't met somebody who has been able
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.860]   to sway your philosophy.
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:49.060]   For example, one of my great friends for a long time, since I was a kid, I've mentioned
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:56.860]   him before on the show, but his motorcycle license plate is quite literally "Lone Wolf,"
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.420]   his vanity plate says "Lone Wolf."
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.340]   That's his identity, and it has been his identity his entire life.
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:08.220]   And so he's moved all around the country and all around the world living kind of just the
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.420]   "Lone Wolf" lifestyle, always had girlfriends here, girlfriends there, etc.
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.140]   And then I saw him kind of get to about his mid to late 50s, and first of all, his perspective
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:21.380]   on life changed a little bit because he looked around and realized, "I'd like to have something
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.380]   more than endures.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.740]   I'd like to have family."
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.420]   And then he met someone who was super special.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:31.900]   Now it turns out that it didn't work out for him, but unfortunately, she passed away.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.560]   But his entire philosophy changed when he met the right person.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:42.980]   So consider those things as just some thoughtful warnings that be really careful to know yourself
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:49.620]   deeply and don't settle for this philosophy that you are embracing unless there's a strong
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.860]   commitment that you have to a reason for this philosophy.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:58.620]   And I think it will be most fruitful not for traveling or any of that kind of stuff, but
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:05.060]   rather because you want to make a sacrificial life of service in some case.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.900]   Now with regard to traveling, I think I love traveling more than most people.
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:13.300]   But what I would encourage you to do is as quickly as possible, try on whatever it is
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.020]   that you perceive as the kind of lifestyle that you want to live as a single man.
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:22.300]   If you want to go and be a vagabond hobo traveling around the world, then figure out how to get
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:28.080]   yourself a job, start a business where you can do that, and go do it as quickly as possible.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:33.460]   Because once you've experienced it, you will find your own perspective on it more solidified.
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.900]   You may find that, "Oh, indeed, I really love this and I'm super enthusiastic about this
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.180]   and I'm going to do this forever."
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.340]   Fair, right?
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:45.380]   I follow a couple of hobos on YouTube that I really enjoy their content and just these
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:49.860]   old single guys that have done this for 30 years and they bounce around the world living
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.500]   out of a backpack and I enjoy their perspective on life.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.860]   I learn a lot from them.
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.080]   But a lot of people also find that, "You know what, this isn't quite all it was cracked
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.080]   up to be."
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.260]   And what you want to avoid the error is the error of committing your life to a certain
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:10.060]   set of decisions for a very long period of time without having tried it out a little
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.060]   bit.
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.520]   And so get as quickly as possible to your ideal lifestyle.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.580]   And as a single guy, you have enormous flexibility to accomplish that right now.
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:24.620]   So if traveling is your thing, then this year, spend three to six months traveling.
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:30.420]   Quit your apartment, whatever you got to do to fix your finances, fix them, meaning quit
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:35.940]   your apartment, move into a box truck, convert a box truck into your home, go and live in
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.620]   beautiful places, stay in national parks, work online, get a job.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.780]   If you want to go travel to another country, then get rid of all your stuff, get on an
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.020]   airplane and go.
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:48.540]   You can simultaneously fix your current financial troubles with having a negative net worth
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.380]   being deeply in debt, etc., while also testing these things out.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.140]   And that process will inform you very significantly about what you actually like and what you
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.180]   don't like in an important way.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.660]   Now pivoting to financial planning.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:06.020]   Let's assume that after all of this, you say, "Joshua, you know, that's fine, but I definitely
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.860]   want to be completely independent.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.300]   I'm not going to sacrifice my independence to another person.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.780]   And you know, it sounds fine that some people want to go and dedicate their life to their
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.980]   religion or a cause or something, but that's not me, I'm dedicating my life to me."
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:24.060]   And then the second thing is, "I've tested this, for the last five years I've been testing
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.660]   this lifestyle, now I'm trying to fix it."
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.900]   So what are your basic financial steps?
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:36.620]   Step number one is to figure out how to generate an income that allows you to live the lifestyle
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.020]   you want to live with a minimal amount of waiting.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:45.940]   So if you were married and/or had children, what the pressure that puts on your shoulders
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:52.060]   as a man is that you have to subjugate some of your personal desires to what's best for
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.580]   the family.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.660]   And so, for example, if I were single, I probably would live in a box truck somewhere because
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:04.500]   I have that kind of vagabond personality, I enjoy a lot of aspects of that.
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:11.420]   I'd probably have an apartment somewhere, but I enjoy kind of that weird lifestyle of
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.840]   traveling around.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.900]   But obviously, although I've tested it, I don't think that's an appropriate or useful
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:24.240]   lifestyle for my wife or my children to grow up in.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:30.780]   And so I consciously make the decision to move away from how I would live and I focus
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.580]   on what's right for my family.
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.660]   You don't have that constraint.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.380]   You can live however you want to live.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:43.700]   And the only thing that's the impediment to your living however you want to live is you're
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.820]   having enough income to pay for it.
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.980]   And so that should be your primary focus.
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.780]   You have an $80,000 income.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.260]   You should, number one, clear away this debt as quickly as possible, whatever it is, even
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:59.020]   if it's student loans, even if it's low interest, et cetera, because it's harming to some degree
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.900]   your independence, et cetera.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:06.240]   But you should focus most of all on earning your income in a way that is personally agreeable
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.780]   to you, that provides you with the kind of lifestyle that you want to live, because that's
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.700]   the fastest way to even just getting and testing it.
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:19.060]   And if you can earn your income in a way that is agreeable to you personally, then you don't
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.060]   need to do that much else with money.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.680]   In the fullness of time, you do need to pay careful attention to building a plan that
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.960]   protects yourself, knowing that you cannot depend on any other people.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:38.660]   So if I get sick or if I get hurt and I can't work, I have a wife to fall back upon.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.420]   I have children to fall back upon if I'm older and they're adults, et cetera.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:48.020]   And so I have to maintain insurance when my children are younger, and of course I will
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:54.780]   maintain appropriate protection as my children are older, but I have a very strong and robust
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:59.740]   fallback plan, where if something happened to me, I got sick, I got hurt, I got paralyzed,
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.140]   et cetera, then I can fall back on other people.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.220]   As a single man, you don't have that.
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:11.460]   You don't have the ability to rely on other people through love relationships, therefore
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:16.300]   you have to rely on other people through contractual financial relationships.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.500]   And so you need to think very carefully about appropriate insurance coverages, and you need
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.460]   to think very carefully about making sure you have money to pay for yourself when you're
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.860]   old and crippled, unable to provide for yourself, et cetera.
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:33.380]   And so for you, it becomes much, much more important for you to accumulate wealth, to
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.540]   invest for the long term, to maintain high quality disability income insurance, high
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.700]   quality health insurance.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.580]   You obviously don't need life insurance if there's nobody depending on your income, but
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:48.560]   you definitely need to care for health insurance, disability income insurance, and those insurance
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.820]   plans need to see you for the very long term.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:57.380]   And so you need to accumulate quite a lot of money so that when you're 65 and you're
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:01.740]   worrying about Medicare falling apart, you have an additional backup plan, because you
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:06.100]   don't have the backup plan that I'll have of five children that can care for me if I
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.740]   need it, et cetera.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:14.380]   And so also then now, you need to be very, very focused on building up your reserves
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:19.700]   and seeing to your health and seeing to try to avoid those negative outcomes.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.420]   And that should be the guiding point.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:26.940]   However, I would put all of that still secondary to saying, whatever lifestyle is that you
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:31.100]   think you're going to go, that you want to do, go and test it as vigorously as possible
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.820]   and then fit all that financial planning into that lifestyle as quickly as possible.
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.700]   So those are kind of my initial thoughts.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.700]   What's the debt from, the $100,000?
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.660]   Is that student loans or did you spend a bunch of money?
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.660]   What's that from?
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.620]   Yeah, I just spent a bunch of money.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:49.020]   But I've recently got that onto like a credit counseling thing.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:54.820]   So I was paying like $2,500 a month, but now we got that under so I can actually take care
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.160]   of it within my income.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.020]   So I feel a lot better about that.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.020]   Good.
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.740]   Are you living a fairly conventional lifestyle, living in a house, living in an apartment,
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:02.740]   et cetera?
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.340]   Or are you already living an unconventional lifestyle?
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.700]   No, I'm in an apartment.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:13.140]   And we've actually spoken previously about the merits of living in my Prius, which I
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.500]   thought very, very closely about, but that was like right before COVID and I'm glad I
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.040]   didn't do it.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:25.020]   But yeah, I mean, I think I've bounced around the ideas of van life and that, but I think
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.780]   just a basic comfortable apartment is for me.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.780]   Okay.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:35.100]   So I would just say, get rid of the past decisions, meaning get rid of the debt, especially if
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.180]   the debt just came from previous overspending, get rid of the debt and then resolve to yourself
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.980]   that in the future, you're not going to spend more than you have because you don't want
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.980]   to put yourself into bankruptcy if it can at all be avoided and especially dumb to go
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.600]   into bankruptcy for a consumer debt.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.500]   But get rid of the debt as quickly as possible and then just craft the income to fit your
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.600]   lifestyle.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.780]   And so recognize that it's very accessible to you.
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.380]   So if you want to, and don't be scared of quick change.
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:06.580]   One of the things that I wish I had done more of when I was single was pursue some of the
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.660]   aggressive plans.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.820]   I played it more conservative than I should have.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:14.260]   But if you want to pick up and move to Southeast Asia, then pick up and move to Southeast Asia.
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:18.820]   You can pay off your debt and et cetera if you can keep your job while working from the
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.220]   place that you want to go.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:25.020]   And I urge you as quickly as possible, do the testing of the lifestyle that you want
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.780]   to see if that's a great lifestyle.
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:32.060]   Because if you change, because you started the conversation by saying I'm probably going
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.340]   to be single the majority of your life.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:39.900]   If you're ever going to change that, it's much better to change at 40 than at 60.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.100]   Everything about marriage is easier when you're younger, especially if you ever have children.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.820]   Everything about children is easier when you're younger.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:50.100]   So you want to change as early as possible and that means you want to test as aggressively
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.100]   as possible.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.300]   We go to Kulin in BY.
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.980]   I don't know that, is that one of the Canadian provinces?
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.980]   Welcome Kulin.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.980]   Hi Joshua.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:28:59.980]   Yes, it's actually in Germany.
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.980]   Okay.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:01.980]   There we go.
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:02.980]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:09.300]   And thanks for the opportunity talking to you again today.
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:13.340]   We talked a year ago and you helped me a lot with a big career decision.
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:21.300]   So I'm working as a strategic advisor, a self-employed, and I'm actually wondering how I do the marketing.
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:26.660]   I'm wondering about increasing my visibility through any dedicated channels like website,
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:31.340]   LinkedIn content, speaking and engagements whatsoever.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:37.820]   As I see the potential to boost my earnings, but I also, I recognize that actually stepping
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:45.860]   out into the public is significant and cannot be reversed, let's say it's an irreversible
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:52.860]   decision and actually I'm worried about privacy, asset protection stuff and so on.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:53.860]   Okay.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.980]   So, let me just make sure I'm understanding.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:00.900]   You are building right now a side hustle, kind of a new thing of working as a strategic
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.100]   advisor or this is your full-time job?
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.100]   It's my full-time job.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.100]   Okay.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:10.020]   So you're working as a full-time job and you want to build a business working as a strategic
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:15.420]   business advisor, but you're thinking about how do I bring in clients, how do I bring
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:21.340]   in business and in an effective way so that my business can be successful, but I'm also
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.460]   concerned about privacy.
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.460]   Is that correct?
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.460]   Correct.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.460]   Okay.
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:33.060]   Do you rely for your current business, whatever current clients and customers that you have,
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:38.020]   are you currently relying on your reputation that's associated with your personal name
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.180]   from your previous career before this one?
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:49.620]   Yes, a bit, and also from my previous clients in my current role, yeah.
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:54.860]   So it's all about referrals right now and what I can observe from other strategic advisors
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:31:00.100]   is that they really have a great reputation and they are doing a lot of speaking engagements
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.100]   and so on.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:05.860]   So, if you have a name in the world, then it's easier for you to get booked.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.060]   Okay.
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:12.140]   And I may remember speaking to you in the past, it's my impression that while you're
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:17.300]   trying to build this business, you also are not relying entirely on this business for
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.020]   your financial needs.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.500]   You have some other assets saved, is that correct?
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.500]   Correct.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.500]   Okay.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:30.580]   So if that's the case, if you have other resources that can provide you with long-term support,
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:35.100]   then it means that you can take a more strategic approach to building the kind of business
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.620]   that you'll definitely want to have 10 years from now.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.760]   And that may be different than the business that you would build if you definitely needed
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.060]   money 10 weeks from now.
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.540]   And so that is an important consideration.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.460]   One more question, then I'll give you my thoughts.
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.980]   Why would you be concerned about privacy?
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:59.580]   What benefits do you personally perceive in maintaining your privacy?
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:06.940]   Yeah, just to live a life which is absolutely independent from my profession, right?
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:12.020]   And so what I can see is you never know how successful you could become, right?
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:18.440]   And what I see is that very successful, very rich people, they made the decision very early
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.460]   to not go out into the public, right?
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:24.020]   So they are, especially in Germany, we have a lot of hidden champions.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.220]   Nobody knows how rich they are.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.720]   And you need to make that decision very early.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.460]   So this is actually the thought process behind it.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.800]   Okay.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.100]   Privacy would have a number of different layers.
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:47.260]   And almost everything that you do for privacy will harm your business success, unless your
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:51.540]   business is something related to privacy itself, which is not what you're talking about.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:57.700]   So by pursuing privacy, you are handicapping yourself.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.020]   You're making it hard for yourself to succeed.
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.240]   It doesn't mean it's not worth doing.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.060]   I personally believe that every private dollar that you earn is worth probably double to
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.980]   triple of every non-private dollar.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:15.300]   And I'm not referring to tax evasion, I'm just simply saying that you receive less trouble,
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.700]   less difficulty, et cetera, if you can avoid public scrutiny.
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:23.340]   And so I affirm your desire, and I'm going to tell you my thoughts on how to accomplish
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:29.900]   it, but we must acknowledge that you're making it difficult for yourself when you do that.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:34.260]   So there would be a number of different things that you could keep private, and you could
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:38.820]   decide how aggressively you want to pursue privacy.
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:42.460]   The first thing that you could do is you could operate under your current name, the name
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:47.700]   that you're known by, and you could just protect your face.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.820]   You could even protect your voice.
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:57.000]   And to me, the face is actually your most valuable form of privacy.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.220]   If you were a skilled business strategist, and you have the ability to write compelling
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:08.540]   articles that are useful, maybe creating a podcast where it's just your voice, but there's
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:14.900]   no face associated with it, then you avoid most of the frustrating aspects of notoriety,
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:20.000]   which is being recognized personally in public, et cetera, but you're able to be competitive
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.860]   and effective with your clients by simply using your ideas.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:28.900]   And as a business strategist, that is probably something that performs a good or provides
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:34.060]   a good and effective form of marketing.
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:38.020]   And so can you write an effective blog, can you write effective papers, can you publish
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.460]   in trade journals of the industry that you're targeting, et cetera, and just keep your face
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.460]   out of it.
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.940]   That's going to maintain a lot of privacy for you.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:51.820]   If you want to change and you want to change the name that you're associated with, the
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:56.140]   simplest thing to do that is simply to have a business name that you work under.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.540]   And that's very, very normal and relatively easy to accomplish.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.660]   So as an example, I have a friend of mine that I've worked with on various projects
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.380]   named Gabriel Custodiate.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:09.700]   Gabriel, I'm quite certain, is not his legal name.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:15.500]   I have no idea what his legal name is, and I don't care, because to me his name is Gabriel.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.140]   It's just as good as anything else.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.780]   And so I'll just interact with him under that name.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:26.020]   And so legally speaking, and I'm not expert on all the EU laws, but I can speak from the
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:33.540]   American perspective, what you should do is simply operate your business under a business
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:38.540]   name in the same way that an author may publish under a pen name.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:43.420]   And to do that avoids all of your legal risks, because you're not representing yourself to
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:47.500]   a government agent as somebody other than who you are, you're just simply representing
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.820]   yourself to the public under a certain name.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.020]   And the classic example is any author.
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:36:00.820]   Again, Mark Twain is a well-known author, but his legal name is not Mark Twain, or who's
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:10.900]   the guy, Ibram Kendi, or Muhammad Ali, almost any of these guys, their name that they operate
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:16.540]   their business under is an assumed name that fits their personality, or it fits the image
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.380]   that they're trying to reflect, etc.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.860]   It's not their legal name.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.860]   And you can do that as well.
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:25.100]   So you just choose a name that you do business under, and then the name that you do business
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.860]   under is not your legal name.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.900]   That eliminates all legal risk, because whenever you present an identification, you're using
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:37.700]   your formal, official government identification, but whenever you do business in public, or
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.520]   you give a speech, etc., you're known under this other name.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.220]   Now a good way to do this, that I think is probably the best privacy advice that most
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:49.180]   people should do, is just simply have a nickname that you operate under.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:55.140]   And so years ago I knew a man named Sonny, I'll skip saying his last name, but I thought
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:37:00.620]   for basically all of the time that I have known him, that his name was Sonny, like that
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:03.420]   was just his name, his name was Sonny.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:09.240]   And because he, that was, had everyone called him, that was his name, it was on everything.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.180]   It was only decades later that I realized that was not his legal name.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.220]   His legal name was something else that I'm completely ignorant of.
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:24.260]   Or I have another friend who has a name that is often shortened into letters, and so in
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:29.380]   English we do this a lot with AJ and DJ and things like that.
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:38.000]   So this friend, he always did business under his, he was known by this abbreviation.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.260]   And then one time he was arrested, but he was booked and arrested under his legal name.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:49.320]   And so because he was always known under the initials AJ, for example, then everyone knew
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.620]   him as AJ, not Alex Jones.
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:58.580]   And so when Alex Jones is legally incarcerated, then he still maintains privacy because when
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:04.020]   people search for him, they search for AJ, not Alex Jones, and it provides him some protection.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.860]   And so those are just kind of some simple things that you could do that probably are
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.280]   not too disruptive and work out fairly well.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.700]   In terms of building the business, the most important thing, if you're going to build
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.660]   something private, is to focus on results.
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:24.900]   And so your best solution to building a private business is to be known as extremely effective
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.620]   and extremely discreet.
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:31.540]   So the guy who can come in and who can double revenue or double profit in three years will
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:37.540]   be talked about among other people in that industry, and they don't really care what
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.300]   he does business under, what name he does anything under.
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:44.780]   And so that is going to be your most effective marketing term.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:51.020]   If you have to go to the public and try to market in public, then you're automatically
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.020]   going to bring in more scrutiny.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.820]   So there's probably a lot more that could be said about effective marketing, but I would
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:01.740]   like to sidestep some of that discussion because that'll be so focused on this particular niche
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:02.740]   that you're in.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:09.420]   My comment is simply that people who get results are the most important thing, and that if
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:17.700]   you are the guy who gets results, then your privacy bent, your proclivity to privacy,
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:24.180]   your inclination towards privacy can actually be a very appealing aspect of your business,
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:27.540]   especially if you are in the business of just making people money.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:32.180]   So what I would say put simply is I would assume a nickname, and a nickname or a pen
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:36.620]   name under which you do business, have it be something related to what you're doing,
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:41.580]   if convenient, so that people who know you in the past, you just say, "Hey, I've changed
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:42.580]   that."
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.500]   Consider going to initials and not make too much of a big deal out of it, but just do
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:51.020]   business under this new name and keep your current identity the way that it is, and then
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:55.100]   focus on being someone who gets results and gets referred around the industry privately
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.100]   for the good results that you have, rather than trying to do a lot of public marketing.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.900]   And that would avoid a lot of those problems that you're describing.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:05.180]   Thank you very much.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.180]   My pleasure.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.180]   All right.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.180]   We move on to Max in Virginia.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.180]   Max, welcome to the show.
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.180]   How can I serve you today?
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.180]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.180]   Can you hear me?
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.180]   Sounds good.
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.180]   Awesome.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.180]   Happy New Year.
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.900]   Thanks for taking my call.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.820]   I've got sort of a two-part question.
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:23.740]   They're different topics, but tied together, at least in my life.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:29.940]   So for some context, we've got some major life changes coming up in the next year.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:34.980]   My wife and I are expecting our first child in June, and then we're likely going to be
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:39.020]   moving after I complete a residency program.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:47.980]   And that move will accompany me in a new job and a potential big increase in our income.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:54.420]   My question pertains to entering a business contract agreement with someone who has been
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:59.300]   more or less a mentor/family friend for me.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:04.980]   We have a relationship on great terms, someone that I trust and value, and kind of navigating
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:13.740]   the contract details and doing my due diligence, because I've never entered a business contract
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.740]   agreement with someone who's been a student most of my life.
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:24.540]   So at this point, we've essentially just had a verbal agreement to move forward with formalizing
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:25.540]   a contract.
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:32.580]   And a couple of the big points that at least I know we'll want to cover on this contract
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:41.740]   are how I'll be paid, whether it's 1099 or W-2, the potential for ownership in the future.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:47.300]   And the way these contracts are normally done is there's like a one- or two-year associate
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.820]   trial period.
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:55.580]   And then if the doctor/owner wants to sell a portion of the practice, then you could
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.380]   potentially buy in if that works out.
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:01.480]   But usually, that's baked into the first contract.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:09.060]   And then I guess the trickier thing is a lot of the time, these contracts have non-compete
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.060]   clauses.
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:14.220]   And we both want to protect ourselves, but kind of within reason.
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:20.720]   I'm trying to come up with what would be a fair compromise for that, just to preserve
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:27.740]   the relationship, but being cognizant of just the business side of things.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:33.140]   So I was hoping for your insight just on things that I should prioritize in a business contract
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.140]   like this.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:39.020]   And then if we have time at the end, I'll add on.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:46.280]   In what way will your business partnership put both of you individually in a better situation
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:52.700]   because you're together than you could achieve on your own?
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:43:01.820]   I think in our profession, we probably would both agree that it's better to have two to
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:10.340]   three doctors in an existing practice, just in terms of sharing the workload, and also
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:16.260]   to be able to take time off more liberally and more flexibility with that.
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.540]   That's kind of my perspective.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:23.220]   I'm pretty sure he has the same.
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:28.740]   And also, starting my own thing is not really something that I'm too keen on doing right
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:32.060]   now just because of the workload that would come along with that.
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:38.060]   I'd like to join an existing operation, so I don't have to go through all the startup
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:42.940]   work.
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:47.780]   In terms of what I hear you asking is a fairly general question of what advice would you
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.340]   have for entering into a business partnership as I come out of residency.
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:57.220]   Is that basically, in a nutshell, your question, or was there something more specific that
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.220]   I missed?
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.220]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:05.380]   No, that's the question, and then I don't know if it's with someone that I already know
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.420]   and trust, I guess.
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:12.580]   I'm a little cautious moving into that.
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:17.900]   To me, the most useful advice that I can give you would be fairly general, but also extremely
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:21.240]   impactful.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:26.140]   In any kind of partnership, be it a business partnership, be it a marriage, be it just
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:35.140]   a project that you're working on, etc., both partners need to be fully persuaded that they're
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:40.900]   better off together than each one individually is on his or her own.
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:45.620]   And if you can accomplish that, if you can be convinced that we're better off together,
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:50.060]   then in many ways it doesn't really matter what the paper says, it doesn't really matter
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:53.380]   the details of the contract, you've solved it.
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:59.180]   But if there's any question about whether or not we're better off together than we are
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:04.780]   apart, then the details of the paper don't necessarily fix anything, no matter how beautifully
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:09.620]   and professionally the details are committed to in a legally binding document.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:14.220]   So to me, that's always where I want to spend 80% of my time, is simply saying, "In what
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:21.080]   way do we, each of us, contribute to one another in a way that we're just convinced makes our
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.700]   partnership synergistic?"
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:27.940]   Meaning one plus one is more than two, that's what synergy means.
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:33.180]   So you could have one plus one, but if it's not more than two when you come together,
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.600]   then you don't have a synergistic relationship.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.140]   And so what is at the core of a synergistic relationship?
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:46.140]   Well, usually it will be partners providing skills and abilities to one another that each
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.920]   one individually lacks.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:53.340]   And so the classic example that I repeatedly use is, if you have one person who loves management
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:58.580]   and another person who loves sales and hates management, or one person who loves sales
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.420]   and another person who loves design, then those people can come together and be a very
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:08.620]   effective partnership because each of them can focus on what he or she does well while
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.780]   leaving the things that they don't want to do to the other person.
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:17.860]   In your situation as doctors, especially as doctors who are basically performing the same
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:28.500]   basic function, you're going to need to find your synergistic value in size, in scale,
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:33.260]   in providing easy relief to one another, that there'll be more time off for each one, etc.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:38.740]   But you need to clearly identify and clearly delineate, write out, communicate clearly
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:43.340]   how we're better off together and what makes us better off together.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:49.100]   And that's something that I would do absent of any individual contract negotiations.
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:54.540]   I would simply do it and be very explicit about it and say, "Why do we get together?"
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:59.740]   So for example, you, the young physician, you're gaining a whole lot of benefit of coming
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:04.140]   into a practice, you don't have to work so much, there's an established patient base,
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:09.020]   etc., there's demand, and so you're getting a lot of benefit, but what is he getting?
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.020]   That would be the question.
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:14.300]   He needs to know what he's getting, otherwise the partnership will feel very one-sided and
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:19.900]   he'll feel like, "Well, the young guy, Max is getting all the benefit, but what am I
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:20.900]   getting for it?
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.340]   Max is just taking all my clients, etc."
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.300]   And so that should be where most of your focus is.
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:29.620]   And I believe that if we spend a good amount of time on this before any partnership going
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.540]   into a partnership, before going in any marriage, etc., is how do we complement one another?
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.800]   How do we have a synergistic relationship?
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:42.460]   And we know that, and we know that the other partner really values what I have to contribute,
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.780]   and I know that I really value what my partner has to contribute, then we build strong and
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.320]   enduring partnerships.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:52.300]   And strong and enduring partnerships don't need a lot of legal protection.
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:57.260]   They don't need a lot of carefully negotiated clauses, because the benefit to the partnership
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:02.420]   is obvious, and it should be the kind of benefit that will endure throughout time and remain
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.940]   obvious over time.
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:10.380]   Any partnership that I have seen fall down and fall apart, become filled with rancor,
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:15.180]   fighting, etc., has basically fallen apart because the partners don't think that we're
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:19.660]   better off together than we are together, which leads me to part two.
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:25.140]   You should anticipate all of the reasons why the partnership would disintegrate and how
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.600]   we would each feel that we're better off apart.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.140]   And so an example often in a business partnership would be this.
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:37.940]   You're coming out of residency, and you're choosing this path because you don't want
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:42.220]   to work very much, meaning you're ready to work, but you don't want to work the way that
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.860]   you would have to work if you were building your own practice.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.860]   And so you're hoping that I can do 50 hours a week, not 90 hours a week.
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:53.860]   Meanwhile, your business partner is expecting you to do 90 hours a week, because after all,
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:54.860]   that's what I did.
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:57.780]   I did 90 hours a week after residency, and you could do that too.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:00.660]   And so where would be the breakdown?
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:03.460]   The breakdown would be he's looking at you and thinking you're a lazy bum because you're
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:04.820]   not working like he worked.
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.740]   Meanwhile, you're saying, "This was the whole reason I got into this," and that leads to
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.540]   a breakdown of communication.
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.940]   This happens when business partners, one of them wants to maximize profit, one of them
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:15.800]   wants to maximize lifestyle.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.980]   This happens in marriages when one person wants to maximize children, the other person
[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:24.540]   wants to maximize global travel, anything.
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:28.820]   It's any time you have a breakdown of vision, then people start to question, "Why am I in
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.340]   this relationship in the first place?"
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.020]   And that's where things go bad.
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:36.980]   And so you should talk together and say, "Well, where would be our weak points?
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:40.180]   What would be the kinds of things that would cause you to feel like the synergy of our
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.420]   relationship has collapsed?
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.580]   And then am I willing to not do those things?
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:51.900]   Am I willing to avoid those actions that would lead to a collapse of synergy that would ultimately
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:54.220]   lead to a collapse of partnership?"
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:59.800]   Now when you and he have had those conversations and you have a good understanding, each of
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:05.300]   you individually, about how you're better off together than you are on your own, and
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.940]   both of you clearly see that you're better off together than on your own, then that's
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:12.500]   when you bring in the lawyer and you draw up the business agreement.
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:17.860]   And you can save yourself an enormous amount of money by simply clearly knowing how you're
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:22.540]   ready to go, and then you just bring in the lawyer to cover anything that you've missed.
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:28.260]   And the legal process is mostly a matter of putting in place what happens if something
[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:29.260]   falls apart.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.700]   And so what happens if we die?
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.140]   What happens if one of us is disabled?
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:34.820]   What happens if one of us is divorced, etc.?
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:39.660]   But all of that stuff can be handled fairly straightforward with specific contract clauses
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:43.460]   that are common in your industry, with insurance policies.
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:48.460]   You might have a buy-sell agreement, etc., funded with insurance, all kinds of things
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.260]   that you'll put in place.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:56.100]   But it all rests on clearly understanding how we are compatible together.
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:51:00.460]   Then for the specific details, I have no idea what's a reasonable non-compete clause.
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:04.980]   What I would say is that those kinds of things are set by the marketplace.
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:11.180]   And so let's say that the standard amount of time for a non-compete in your industry
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:16.580]   is five years, that if this partnership were to dissolve, you can't compete with me in
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.100]   this market for a period of five years.
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:22.980]   Well in that situation, it would be generally unfair to your partner to say, "Well, I don't
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.140]   want it to be a five-year non-compete clause, I want it to be a one-year."
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.260]   But it would also be unfair for him to say, "I want it to be a ten-year."
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:38.700]   And so you'll rely on industry norms, because in essence, your partner is not in competition
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:42.940]   with you, he's in competition with all of the other senior physicians who would like
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.980]   to have you come into their practice.
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:48.900]   And you're not in competition with him, rather you're in competition with all the other
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:51.460]   residents that he would like to bring into practice.
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:56.180]   And then my final comment would be in terms of relationship, okay, what value is there
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.740]   to the relationship?
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:04.740]   Clearly, having a friend, having someone that you trust, etc., is incredibly rewarding and
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.620]   should give you a good solid foundation to go on.
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:11.940]   But it doesn't mean that you can avoid communicating about these difficult things.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:18.580]   And at the end of the day, I don't think there's any relationship of friendship that can overcome
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:22.640]   a basic mismatch in expectation in the fullness of time.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:28.820]   And so I would not rely on the fact that we're friends, etc., in any of this.
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:33.180]   I would rely on the fact that we've clearly communicated with one another and we understand
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:35.700]   how we have a synergistic relationship.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:40.500]   And because we understand how we have a synergistic relationship, then we can negotiate the details.
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:41.500]   Those are my thoughts.
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:42.500]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:43.500]   That's really helpful.
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:49.260]   And I knew I could count on you for your perspective there.
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:54.580]   I think I was getting too lost in the details and you're right, I think just kind of focusing
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:59.500]   on the fact that if we're better together, then the details will kind of work themselves
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.380]   out, you know, after the scenes.
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:07.180]   And then I guess my other question was just, so we're having our first job in June, and
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.620]   then I'm going to go back and re-listen.
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:16.180]   I know you have a ton of content on raising kids, but just in terms of like being a father
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:24.020]   to a newborn, do you, what's your general resource, you have an episode about that.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.460]   I'll go back and listen to it.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:32.100]   And then my wife and I were considering talking with the doula, and I don't know if you have
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:35.500]   any experience with them, or I don't know a lot about it.
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:38.300]   Yeah, yeah, I do.
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:46.380]   I have talked about that publicly previously in detail, and when I get my new website launched
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:50.580]   here very soon, you'll be able to search all the past episodes and specifically zoom in
[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:51.580]   on that.
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:53.380]   And so that'll be a good resource for you.
[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:56.420]   I'm going to give you a fairly abbreviated rapid-fire answer here, just because I have
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:58.660]   a long list of callers afterwards.
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:02.620]   But I do want to make sure that I give you kind of some big points.
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:06.460]   So what I'll try to do is I'll give you the bullet points, but I won't try to defend them
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.140]   in detail.
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:13.660]   Number one, the first thing, as your wife is pregnant, the first thing that you have
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:19.940]   to think about is her health and the specifics of childbirth.
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:26.980]   And so you should take a very careful look at everything that you can do to support her
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:28.920]   and her health.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:33.620]   What I would say is I think the best nutrition book out there is called Deep Nutrition.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.740]   The baby has already been conceived.
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:41.600]   The physician author of the book Deep Nutrition has a protocol for women who are planning
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:46.820]   to conceive and who are hoping to conceive, because her preconception diet is really,
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:47.940]   really important.
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:52.260]   But I would say the most important thing is to get your wife the very best nutrition that
[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:53.900]   she possibly has.
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:57.740]   Your genetic contribution to the baby is done.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:02.380]   And so you want to make sure that for future children that you keep your health as good
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.380]   as possible.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:04.380]   Once you have this baby, it's done.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:08.660]   And so now you're totally focused on her and on her well-being.
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:14.460]   The most important things for a pregnant mother are nutrition, lots and lots of high-quality
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:20.260]   nutrition, lots of really great meat, really high-quality foods and no junk, and then also
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:24.300]   making sure that she gets abundant exercise, lots of walking, etc.
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:29.420]   The exercise should be modest but consistent, because you want her to be really, really
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:30.420]   strong.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:35.060]   And a strong woman who goes into childbirth as a strong woman will have a better experience.
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:42.860]   Related to childbirth, it's really important to dig into your philosophy and create a philosophy
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.140]   of childbirth.
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:48.420]   I'm always acutely aware when I'm speaking to someone who knows much more about biology
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.060]   than I do and human biology.
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:56.740]   However, what I would say is that in Western medicine, my biggest complaint is that in
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:56:01.820]   many ways children and babies are treated as a disease from which a woman needs to be
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:06.560]   delivered instead of as something that is natural and normal and a natural and normal
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:08.340]   part of life.
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:14.660]   I believe that her body is uniquely designed to successfully and painlessly and easily
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:16.220]   deliver a baby.
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:20.180]   There are always individual exceptions to that.
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:24.460]   She may have poor bone structure, she may have some unique biological thing that makes
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:26.180]   it more difficult for her.
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:31.980]   But our standard approach should not be to identify babies as a disease from which a
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:36.680]   woman needs to be delivered, but rather as a normal and natural component of that.
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:43.180]   And so you'll want to dig into how to help her have a healthy, successful childbirth.
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:47.540]   I generally recommend as a starting point the old Ricki Lake documentary called The
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:49.840]   Business of Being Born.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.120]   My wife and I, we watched that doc, it was recommended to us when we were having our
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:58.880]   first baby and I think it's really a great starting point to kind of get an idea of what
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.860]   are my decisions about this.
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:05.100]   In general, the most important thing that you as a husband need to do is make sure that
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:11.140]   your wife feels confident with whatever the choices are that you make regarding childbirth.
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.620]   And so you'll have three basic choices.
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:17.560]   Choice number one is do we plan to have the baby in the hospital?
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:21.100]   Choice number two, do we plan to have the baby in a birthing center?
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:24.820]   And choice number three, do we plan to have the baby at home?
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:30.380]   Now I would guess that your natural inclination as a physician would be to go to the hospital.
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:36.100]   And clearly, from a medical perspective, there may be good reasons to do that.
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.860]   However, the problem is that the hospital is generally a pretty uncomfortable place
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.860]   for mothers to be.
[00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:46.540]   There are enormous numbers of interventions, it's very uncomfortable for her, and your
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:51.700]   experience of having a baby in a hospital is generally not particularly enjoyable.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:57.820]   And so what many mothers, especially mothers who are having pregnancies, where there's
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:02.360]   no contraindications, there's no indication that this is a high-risk pregnancy, etc.,
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:06.820]   then what many mothers will do is they will focus on choosing either a birthing center
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.660]   or an at-home birth.
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:13.340]   And if you go to a birthing center or an at-home birth, then the mother is in charge and she
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:17.680]   can have the kind of birthing experience that she herself wants to have.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:22.900]   And I think that in many cases that itself can lead to more successful medical outcomes
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.700]   than being in the hospital.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:30.960]   And so usually, however, for a first-time birth, unless she's very persuaded that that's
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:37.980]   something that she wants, then you'll probably wind up choosing a hospital just because of
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:40.100]   that being kind of the standard default.
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:45.400]   If you choose a hospital, then as a husband, that's when you have to go into doula mode,
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.660]   and that's when you have to go into advocate mode.
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:52.100]   Because in many cases in the hospital, you have to be the one who fights against the
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:56.780]   physician staff for your wife to have the kind of childbirth that she wants to have
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:58.540]   and is capable of having.
[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:03.100]   Because the hospital is designed around risk minimization and around the convenience of
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:07.920]   the hospital staff, it's not designed for the pleasurable outcome of the mother.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:13.500]   And so a doula is basically an advocate, somebody that you hire to be the mother's advocate.
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.860]   I consider this to be my primary job as a husband.
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:17.920]   I'm her advocate.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:22.740]   And so what I want to make sure is I know exactly what she wants and that I intervene
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:26.780]   and all medical things have to come through me because I'm her advocate.
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:28.660]   And so that is something that you can do.
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:32.780]   But I think a doula, especially in a hospital, is basically a requirement.
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:37.900]   Because what can happen if you hire a great doula is that you're there for your wife,
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:39.180]   you're focusing on her.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:43.340]   The doula is there intervening for you with the hospital staff to make sure that your
[00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:46.540]   wife's desires and wishes are being carried out.
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:51.460]   So that only the interventions that are actually necessary, that the medical team can actually
[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:58.380]   say this is necessary, happen and the rest of it she can focus on herself.
[00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:01.740]   But you'll need to do some thoughts and research on that.
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:09.980]   If your wife doesn't have any counterindications during pregnancy, then I think most people
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:15.260]   should be strongly biased in favor of giving birth in something like a birth center that
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.300]   has a hospital as backup.
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:23.820]   Because the midwives, and here I'm talking about licensed midwives, not nurse midwives,
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:29.700]   but midwives, their training is very different than that of an obstetrician gynecologist.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:36.960]   Because the midwife is trained to see to the mother's, to allow the mother to be in charge
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:43.580]   of her childbirth and to make sure that the medical indications that need to be followed
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:47.380]   are followed, rather than for the physician to be in charge.
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:52.620]   And I don't fault obstetricians for this, but basically they get accustomed to being
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.620]   in charge.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:59.100]   Because when they're called in, there's usually an emergency happening and they've got to
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:01.300]   be in charge because they've got to save a life.
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:05.920]   But most childbirths are not emergencies, and that's where there's a big difference
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.780]   there that you want to think about.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:11.020]   That was a longer explanation than I meant to, but I think it's important.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:17.340]   Now related to that, I am persuaded that a standard of care should be that pregnant women
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:23.140]   should receive consistent chiropractic adjustments to make sure that their hips are properly
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:30.900]   aligned to create a maximal possibility of a safe, healthy, vaginal childbirth.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:35.620]   And I think the most important thing that you want to do as a husband and work with
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:41.220]   your wife is you want to focus very deeply on eliminating any fear that is related to
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.580]   childbirth.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:49.540]   American women broadly, Western women broadly, often are quite apprehensive about childbirth
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:54.940]   for various reasons, but largely related to the fact that they've only ever seen, like
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:02:00.700]   a lot of times for a new mother, the first childbirth she ever sees is her own baby.
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.300]   And she's never been in childbirth that's different than that.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:09.080]   And so all of the childbirths that she's ever witnessed are on a TV show, and they show
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.420]   a woman screaming her head off underneath a bright fluorescent light, lying in a hospital
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:17.940]   bed surrounded by people who are screaming and shouting and shouting out for an emergency.
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:21.500]   And that's why I always like the Business of Being Born documentary, because you can
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.920]   see that childbirth doesn't have to be like that.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:30.240]   And so thankfully, with five children and counting, my wife and I, our childbirth experiences
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.440]   have been night and day from that.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.560]   Rather than them being medical emergencies that are loud or that are painful, etc., we've
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.060]   had smooth, easy births.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:45.860]   The process of labor has always been something that is very intimate, where we're together,
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:46.860]   we're very close.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:51.580]   I know how to support her, she knows how her body labors, she can listen to her body.
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:58.260]   And generally speaking, while I wouldn't say that it's not fair to say that childbirth
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:06.340]   is pain-free, there is certainly intense sensation related to childbirth, but it has never been
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:10.060]   for my wife a debilitating pain the way that it's pictured.
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:15.140]   And a significant portion of that is physical, but a significant portion of that is just
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:21.140]   mental, because a woman who is scared of childbirth will tense up, she experiences the sensations
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:24.940]   of labor very differently than a woman who is relaxed and confident.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.540]   And if you study cultures around the world, there are cultures around the world where
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:32.940]   mothers have a completely different experience with childbirth than they do in the West.
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:38.500]   And I care about this because if your wife is â€“ first of all, you want her to have
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:43.540]   kind of the best possible outcome, but I also care about this because the experience that
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:51.140]   she has with childbirth can make an enormous difference in the experience that â€“ in your
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:53.140]   guys' willingness to have multiple babies.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:57.620]   I had a close friend of mine who, when they got married, they said, "We're going to
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:59.300]   have a huge family."
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:03.500]   And right off the gate, the first baby childbirth experience was so terrible that they resolved
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.460]   we're never having children again.
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:10.500]   And those kinds of things can, in some cases, be avoided.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.520]   Final thing is that hypnobirthing is quite popular.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.780]   It's the best that I've found of the different methods, and we've used the hypnobirthing
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:20.380]   techniques very effectively, and I encourage that.
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.820]   But those are kind of your big decisions.
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:24.980]   Now, what you asked me about was kind of baby.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:30.780]   First thing is that, if at all possible, schedule some time after the childbirth to take significant
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.940]   amounts of time to take care of your wife.
[01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:38.060]   What caught us unawares because we had spent so much time researching childbirth, et cetera,
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:41.540]   was how difficult the first few weeks of a baby's life are.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.840]   Hypnobirthing, brutal, worse than childbirth.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.540]   You know, all this other stuff has been much more difficult for us.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:47.840]   And so that was a separate thing.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.640]   That was what I was unprepared for first time around.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:57.320]   So I would encourage you, engage with as much as possible, plan, learn about breastfeeding,
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:03.960]   make sure you have a lactation consultant that you can call if needed, et cetera.
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:07.480]   And then your most important job is just make sure that she is super comfortable and taken
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.480]   care of.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:13.200]   There's almost nothing that you yourself can do for a new baby.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.000]   For the first week, obviously, your wife's not going to lift the baby, so you'll change
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   all the diapers.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.520]   You'll take care of all that stuff because she can't lift the baby.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:21.520]   And she needs to recover.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.420]   But after that point in time, there's not really much that you can do with a newborn.
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.520]   And so it's fine.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.600]   You go back to work.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.600]   Everything's good.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.040]   But what you got to do is you got to make sure that she's prepared for that and that
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.760]   she's supported through the process so that she can do her job in that period of time.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:39.480]   And then after a few years, after a few months, frankly, it's a few months, but after a couple
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.320]   of years, then the baby's no longer a newborn and then they're actually fun and then you
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.800]   actually enjoy being with them.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:48.160]   So your wife falls in love with a newborn, and I've never fallen in love with any of
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.160]   my newborns.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.160]   It always takes a couple of years.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:53.200]   Then I'm like, wow, this is an actual child that I can interact with, not a newborn baby.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.920]   So that's my broad picture overview of kind of the points that I always try to hit that
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:57.920]   I think are really important.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.920]   - Thanks, Joshua.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:59.920]   Very, very helpful.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.920]   - My pleasure.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:01.920]   All right.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:06.920]   We go on to, oh, people are jumping back on after I got rid of them.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.920]   Gail.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:08.920]   Gail in California.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.920]   That's you.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:10.920]   Welcome to the show.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:11.920]   How can I serve you today?
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:12.920]   Gail in California.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:13.920]   All right.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:14.920]   We'll come back to Gail.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:15.920]   We'll go to Mike.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920]   Mike, welcome to the show.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.920]   How can I serve you today?
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.920]   Mike, that's you.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:19.920]   Can you hear me?
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.920]   All right.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.920]   Mike, mute yourself.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.920]   Mike, can you hear me?
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920]   Mike, can you hear me?
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920]   Mike, can you hear me?
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.920]   Mike, can you hear me?
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.920]   Mike, can you hear me?
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.920]   Mike, can you hear me?
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.920]   Mike, can you hear me?
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:29.920]   Mike, can you hear me?
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.920]   Mike, can you hear me?
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920]   All right.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.920]   Mike muted himself.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.920]   We'll go to Jonathan in Colorado.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.920]   Jonathan, welcome to the show.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920]   How can I serve you today?
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.920]   Jonathan, that's me.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:37.920]   That's you.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:38.920]   Coincidentally, last name Medicaid.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:39.920]   I wondered.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:40.920]   I saw it on the screen.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.920]   Is that actually your last name?
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.920]   No.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.920]   Okay.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.920]   I was going to say.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.920]   That's funny.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:53.720]   I'm a little into privacy kind of the way I know you are.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.280]   My favorite about my audience is that when I sell a course or something, I get all these
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.480]   opaque, blurred email addresses and whatnot.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.160]   It makes me happy to see you guys doing that.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.040]   So I'm happy to have you here, Jonathan, Medicaid.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.040]   Awesome.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.040]   I really appreciate the podcast.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:13.400]   I've been a long-time listener, just all the way back.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:17.800]   No, I didn't start all the way back, but I've definitely lurked very far back, so I'm just
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.840]   really grateful for this as a ministry.
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:21.840]   Thank you.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:22.840]   I had a question.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:33.720]   My relative, he's very close to end of life, and now he has a house that's worth roughly
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.560]   $300,000.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:41.480]   That's the only assets that he has left, besides a car or something, and he's in long-term
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.380]   care.
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:50.280]   My parents are afraid that Medicaid, in order to qualify, he needs to get his assets or
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:55.800]   whatever down, but I think he can qualify for Medicaid if it's his own personal residence,
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.560]   but there'll be a loan.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:04.000]   So whenever he dies, they put a Medicare lien on the estate and so they'll take it, or they'll
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   go through all that closure.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.480]   They're super afraid, and to my knowledge, they don't have any equity in the house.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:16.480]   It's all the guy who's going to have Medicaid, and so I was wondering if you had any recommendations
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:22.400]   about how to navigate that, how could they maybe get the equity in their name or something,
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:26.560]   because they're kind of afraid whenever he dies that they're going to foreclose on the
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.560]   house, or not foreclose.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.080]   They're just going to sell it to get the equity out.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:37.360]   So the question is, how do they try to protect it from Medicaid forcing the sale of the house?
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:45.200]   Yeah, and if they could somehow protect equity, the whole look back thing, they can't go sell
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:51.360]   it now and give, or they can't sell it for like 10 bucks or whatever to his child because
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:59.800]   the look back period, they would say that it's worth $300,000, you've got that.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.560]   You said he has children.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.040]   Does this man have children?
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.040]   Yes.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.680]   And does he have a wife?
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:07.680]   Is she deceased?
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:08.680]   Where is she in this?
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:16.720]   He had a wife deceased like 10 years ago, and then his child is living in the house,
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:21.920]   and he is in long-term care, has been in long-term care for a long time, and again, now I feel
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.920]   bad.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:27.000]   I should have told him five years ago to set it up in a medical trust, like, "I'm so sorry,
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   please forgive me."
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   Right.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.920]   And have you consulted with qualified local legal counsel, like a Medicaid lawyer or someone
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:40.320]   like that to find out the detailed rules of your state?
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.320]   It's in North Carolina.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.800]   They've reached out, just I think like a preliminary conversation.
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:49.640]   I just found out about this like a week ago, and then it was the same day that you sent
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:54.160]   out the email saying, "This is for all the poor folks."
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:59.440]   So the first thing I would say is let's get our ideology straight here, and let's understand
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:05.400]   that the goal of his assets is not to keep the money away from the government.
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:10.480]   The goal is for him to use the money that he has to pay for his care.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:18.240]   And this is his asset, and as such, it's something that should be used for his well-being.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.800]   And that is the primary focus.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.480]   And so whatever the right decision is that leads to the best outcome for him and his
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:29.120]   well-being, that's where our focus needs to be.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:33.400]   And I know that we all agree on that, but a lot of times we get into this idea that,
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:38.160]   "Well, how can I skin the government program and get as much money as I can from the government
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.360]   program instead of using the money?"
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:49.200]   And that to me is a complete reversal of any intelligent planning, and often very, very
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.200]   harmful.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:54.280]   Any time anyone else does that, and they say, "Well, I'm going to get as much as I can from
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:58.520]   this unemployment program and keep my unemployment checks coming in," or, "From this medical
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:03.320]   program," et cetera, there's never any good long-term outcome from that, because the people
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:08.640]   that do that wind up not living the life that they're capable of, and in some cases they
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:14.720]   wind up soiling their soul by committing fraud, either minor or major, et cetera, and they
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.340]   just don't get a good outcome.
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:20.440]   And you don't want somebody spending the last months of his life looking over his shoulder
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.800]   and thinking, "Well, what's going to happen with the Medicaid people," et cetera.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.640]   You want him to have the best outcome.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:33.600]   So if that were to mean, for example, that the house is sold so that the money of $300,000
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:38.800]   is freed up to pay for his care, if his family and you or whoever else is involved decides
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:43.600]   that that's the best thing to do, then that's the best thing to do, and that's what should
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.600]   be done.
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.440]   Now probably, because he's living in the house, receiving care, et cetera, then probably that's
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:53.480]   not the best thing that should be done, but all of your first conversations, all of your
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:59.600]   first advice, all of your first discussions should be related to what is the best outcome
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:04.740]   for him and how do we use his assets to provide for his best outcome.
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:09.520]   Only after you're clear on what the ideal outcome is do you then turn and say, "Is there
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.160]   a way that we can get this ideal outcome in a more efficient way?"
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.160]   And that's where you turn to Medicaid planning.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.520]   Now in terms of Medicaid planning, the rules are very clear, and so you want to check the
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.080]   rules of your state, they're publicly available, you can read about them.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:29.360]   I don't know what the rules of North Carolina are, but generally there is an exception for
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.800]   equity that's in a personal residence.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:37.440]   And so if he owns this house outright and it's $300,000, generally those assets are
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.840]   accepted from Medicaid eligibility.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:45.400]   If however, there's a cap on how much, and let's say it's $150,000, then just follow
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:50.640]   the rules and you say, "Okay, well when he dies the house is going to be sold, the $150,000
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.800]   is going to be paid back to Medicaid, and then we're going to have the rest and the
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:59.740]   rest is going to go on to his children," or whatever the next situation is.
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:03.640]   And this is why it's so important to focus on the fact that our goal is to provide him
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:06.600]   with the best quality care, whatever that is.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:14.960]   And so make sure that this is there for him, that the care is there for him.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:20.160]   Medicaid care may not be the best quality care, even if it is paid for.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.720]   And so this will depend on your state.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:27.120]   In some states, Medicaid nursing homes are not the greatest nursing homes.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:31.560]   In some states, Medicaid in-home care, in theory, should be available, but in reality
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.680]   it's often not.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.620]   And so I don't have any insight into that.
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:39.760]   You will know that by talking to your local Medicaid office, understanding what's available
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:40.840]   to you.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.920]   At this point in time, there may be very few planning options that are available to you,
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:49.000]   but you would know your planning options by reading the Medicaid rules and then talking
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.440]   to a Medicaid lawyer in your area that specializes in this.
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.720]   And generally in one brief consultation, you'll get better advice, they'll tell you if anything
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:04.880]   could be done to protect the asset or not, and then you'll know and be able to move forward.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:09.520]   Don't think that by saving $500 for a consultation with a lawyer, you're making any progress.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.860]   Spend the $500, get the consultation with a lawyer, get a solid authoritative answer
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:16.680]   from somebody who knows, and then move on.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:24.400]   If Medicaid is going to result in them taking, say, half the house, so he goes on Medicaid,
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.080]   understand carefully how the money would be actually used.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:31.840]   Because it may be the case that what you would want him to do would be just toâ€”it may be
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.800]   the case that just a personal loan from, say, a child who is set to inherit the house may
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.680]   be a better solution, or the child can just pay for the care.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.400]   And so if he has a child who's living in the house, and the child is going to inherit
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:48.120]   the $300,000 house, and if the child needs to start making payments of $5,000 a month
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:53.720]   to provide for the in-home care, but we can do that independent of filing for Medicaid
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:58.280]   and putting a lien on the house, that might be something that is better as well.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:06.500]   But I guess at its core, I don't have any other, like, brilliant ideas to add other
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:17.000]   than to solicit the proper advice of the Medicaid lawyer and to focus on his personal well-being,
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.520]   whatever that happens to be.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:24.300]   If you want to recognize that if you don'tâ€”what's the point of the Medicaid, right?
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.160]   What value do you get for Medicaid?
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:31.600]   And I guess this would be just one more creative idea, is that maybe the child who is living
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.120]   in the house can just care for dad, and the care for dad is provided knowing that at the
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:41.520]   end of his life, he's going to have the $300,000 of inheritance that would pay him
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:45.080]   back for six months of care, something like that.
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:49.960]   And so don't jump to Medicaid unless you're sure that Medicaid is going to provide something
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.880]   that can't be provided otherwise.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:55.960]   That would be how I would basically approach it.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.960]   Okay.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.920]   Yeah, no, I appreciate it.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:04.720]   It's a littleâ€”he's been in long-term care for a long time.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:10.720]   His daughter lives in the house, and so the daughter is afraid if he dies, there's this
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.920]   lien on the house, then it will get taken from her, right?
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:17.000]   So she doesn't want toâ€”she's kind of afraid, but okay, yeah, no, I appreciate it.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.440]   I wish I had better answers, but remember, I'll be the harsh one here.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.080]   It's not the daughter's house.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.080]   The fact that she's living in her dad's house may be great, but it's his house.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:30.640]   And so you can't let that stuff interfere.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.960]   Find out what the rules are.
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.600]   There will be an exception for his personal residence, et cetera.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:40.440]   But Medicaid is a government program that is designed to help people who are completely
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.640]   impoverished.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.840]   That's all it is.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:46.800]   And so in order to qualify for Medicaid, you have to be completely impoverished.
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:52.840]   Now you are correct that if the goal is that he be impoverished at the end of his life,
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:57.600]   he could have done all kinds of things five, ten years ago in order for him to be impoverished.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:01.760]   I have yet, in any financial planning circumstance, ever recommended that to anybody because I
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:04.960]   don't think being impoverished is a great idea, and I don't think relying on government
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.960]   programs that are designed for people who are impoverished is a great idea.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:15.880]   And so I bristle at people trying to game the system and try to use programs that are
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:21.000]   designed for people who are impoverished so that they can keep their $300,000 houses.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.560]   It's not appropriate, and I'm not accusing them of â€“ I'm speaking clearly in hopes
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.960]   that it will help them to think clearly.
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:32.760]   But you don't have the right to access a government program that is designed for people
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:38.040]   who are impoverished and then also keep a giant asset for yourself.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:41.880]   There are rules that can protect the house, but all of the rest of the money should be
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:45.000]   spent on his care, and that is his right.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.840]   It is his asset, and his asset should be spent on his care, not try to manipulate it so that
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:57.360]   he can qualify for a substandard government program.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.840]   Sean or Shan in Tennessee, welcome to the show.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:00.840]   How can I serve you today?
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:01.840]   Hi, Joshua.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:02.840]   Can you hear me?
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.840]   Yes.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:04.840]   Go ahead.
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.840]   Hey, Joshua.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:12.880]   First of all, thank you so much for all the podcasts over the years.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:16.920]   I've been a pretty regular listener, so I appreciate this opportunity.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.600]   Joshua, we're in a unique situation.
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:28.640]   My wife is a very high income earner, so am I, and we recently visited a few Latin American
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.640]   countries.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:34.160]   And every time we go visit a country, we feel like we should move here, right?
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:37.920]   Because I'm learning Spanish, she's fluent in Spanish, and so forth.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:41.920]   But the problem we face is if we move there, we give up this high income.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:47.720]   For example, when I say high income, we made over 800,000 last year.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.760]   So we feel like we should stay back in Tennessee then, right?
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:56.800]   So I just wonder, when you counsel or coach people, very high income earners like us,
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:02.800]   right, who are looking to possibly go somewhere else, how should we think about that?
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:07.860]   Generally, you should not give up an $800,000 income to move to a Latin American country.
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:12.000]   So I would counsel against that in almost every circumstance.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.720]   When you have the ability to create a high income, that is far and away your most important
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:22.840]   asset, and it's something that deserves to be treated with tender loving care for a very
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:29.520]   long period of time, because it can fundamentally transform your lives and the lives of many
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.660]   people around you if leveraged appropriately.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:39.400]   So we begin by saying, is the generation of this income unpleasant or undoable in some
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.400]   way?
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:46.200]   Is there a reason, other than the fact that you enjoy being in Latin America, do you not
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.200]   like your work?
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.280]   Do you not like your businesses, et cetera?
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.680]   Tell me about how satisfied you are with your jobs.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:20:00.800]   Yeah, so it's one of those things where with her profession, it's all or nothing, meaning
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:06.720]   the contract is tacitly written such that you're going to make over 600,000 or zero.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.560]   There is no in between.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:12.000]   So it's like one of those things where if she could scale back, we could just stay back
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.240]   in the U.S.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:18.520]   So every time we go visit these places, they're so cheap to live in, they're super safe.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:23.280]   We feel culturally at home there.
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.800]   That's where it comes from.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:30.520]   So it's one of those, if you will, a first world problem, but yeah, that's where it comes
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:31.520]   from, Josh.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:35.000]   Basically, Joshua, basically it's zero or 600,000 in our case.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.320]   What does she do?
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.320]   She does telemedicine.
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:44.520]   By license, she can't practice anywhere else, basically.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:50.720]   Anywhere else in the United States or anywhere else outside the U.S.?
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.800]   Could she practice in a U.S. territory?
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:57.900]   We haven't explored that.
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:00.400]   You mean like Puerto Rico or Virgin Islands, perhaps?
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:04.060]   We haven't explored that, Joshua, that's a good point.
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:14.000]   So unless the job or business is deeply unpleasant, in which case, obviously, make changes, then
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.260]   don't give up a job or a business that's working.
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:19.260]   There's an old saying, right?
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:23.320]   Make hay while the sun shines, and financially, make hay while the sun shines.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:28.260]   Almost any one of our jobs or businesses can be disrupted in no time at all.
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:33.220]   And so when you have a high income, you've gotten there by creating something really
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:37.500]   special, and having that high income can buy you freedom very quickly.
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.900]   What's your current net worth at the moment?
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:44.980]   Over $4 million, let's say $4.1 million-ish.
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:48.060]   And about how much do you spend normally in your lifestyle right now?
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:51.020]   That's a good thing about Tennessee, Joshua, right?
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:55.140]   We probably spend, let's say, $65,000 to $70,000 a year.
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:56.140]   Great.
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:22:03.700]   So right now, you could cover your lifestyle, basically, as current state with income from
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:08.100]   your current portfolio, and every year that goes forward, you could do that again.
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:13.780]   So obviously, financial independence is a very real possibility.
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:15.740]   Do you want to retire?
[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:21.800]   Does she want to retire for some reason?
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:26.580]   She wants to scale back down, and she feels like the only way she scales back down is
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:29.180]   if she leaves the country where she cannot really work.
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:31.700]   So let's say, for example, we're in Mexico.
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:32.700]   She can't work.
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:33.700]   Why can't she work?
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:34.700]   It's one of those weird things.
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:42.940]   It's for insurance reasons, I guess, and an employer has some kind of VPN block, and
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:45.740]   she can't log in, let's say, Josh, one of those things.
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:46.740]   All right.
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:50.660]   So first of all, technologically, where there's a will, there's always a way.
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:55.540]   I probably would not take the risk of losing a $600,000-a-year job just so I can go to
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:56.540]   Mexico.
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:01.420]   However, just note that where there's a will, there is always a way, and technologically,
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.980]   this is easy to solve.
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:11.660]   So if she wants to be in Mexico, then obviously, she can put on her own VPN on her own system,
[01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:18.240]   but what I would do is I would set up my computer and all of my infrastructure in Tennessee,
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:23.740]   and then I would just use a remote log-me-in software and always log into my computer and
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:29.380]   work through Tennessee, and that's the simple and obvious solution to solving those geographic
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:30.380]   issues.
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:32.780]   I probably wouldn't take the risk of it for reasons I said.
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:37.580]   If they're that hard-nosed about it, then I'm not going to do that, but she could very
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:43.020]   easily just simply set up a computer through which she does all of her consultations and
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:49.340]   use a log-me-in program into that computer, and no one will ever know that she's elsewhere,
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:55.820]   and that's the safest way to accomplish that other thanâ€”it's much safer to do that than
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:24:03.440]   to use a VPN in her while she'sâ€”and then just set her location to the United States.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:07.740]   So that I would do, and it's worth testing to see kind of does this work, because while
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:12.580]   you may not move full-time and spend 12 months a year in Latin America, knowing that you
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:16.260]   could go for a couple weeks whenever you wanted to without necessarily causing trouble would
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.980]   be worth pursuing.
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:24.140]   Number two is that very seriously consider Puerto Rico, because if you like the Latin
[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:28.560]   culture and you want to live in Latin America, but you want to keep your job, but you have
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.620]   to live in the United States, Puerto Rico is part of the United States.
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:36.140]   And so while it may not be listed in every contract, Puerto Rico is genuinely part of
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:42.180]   the United States, and unless they say specifically that U.S. territories are excluded, then U.S.
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:43.920]   territories are included.
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:47.180]   And so check the paperwork, but that is the obvious solution.
[01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:51.820]   You have a lovely Latin environment, Spanish-speaking environment.
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:55.460]   You could find a great house in a great neighborhood that provides you with the beach lifestyle,
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:58.620]   the Latin culture, all the Latin things that you like.
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:24:59.820]   It's a domestic flight.
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:01.060]   You don't have to have a passport.
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:02.220]   You're back and forth pretty quickly.
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:04.300]   You've got great flight connections.
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.820]   You've got Amazon.
[01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:10.020]   Everything works just like in the United States, except for the things that don't.
[01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:13.760]   But the things that don't generally work better than in many other places.
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:16.020]   She's not going to save any.
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:18.220]   There may be some tax planning that's necessary.
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:23.020]   I don't think she would be able to use the advantageous Puerto Rican tax programs to
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:29.940]   save any money, and in fact, it may wind up costing more money than Tennessee, but I'd
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:33.500]   have to carefully think through those details.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:37.300]   Because if she is a resident of Puerto Rico and she's earning this income as an employee,
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:41.100]   then she'll be subject to Puerto Rican tax rates, which will be higher than the federal
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:44.220]   tax rates that she's paying in Tennessee.
[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:48.020]   And I don't think she would qualify for, again, any of the tax programs.
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:52.720]   But that is an option that allows you to keep $600,000, and if you can keep $600,000 working
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:56.700]   from a house on the beach, follow all the rules, not put your job in legal jeopardy,
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:01.460]   and pay another $20,000 of tax, then I'll take that all day long, versus living in a
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:07.060]   place that you don't want to live if the alternative is walking away from the $600,000 income.
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:15.020]   So I guess, put simply, unless you have a compelling reason to move to Latin America,
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.620]   you shouldn't.
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:17.620]   You shouldn't.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:20.420]   And if you want to move, don't burn all the bridges.
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:25.660]   And so take an extended sabbatical, take three months off, and go for three months, and just
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:27.140]   don't work for three months.
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:30.660]   Take a year off, end her current contract, and don't renew.
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:32.980]   Go take a year, and then come back and renew.
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:37.020]   But don't burn any bridges, because my experience of interacting with people who've moved abroad,
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:43.220]   et cetera, is that the things that if you think you like a lifestyle, you should pursue
[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:44.220]   it.
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:47.780]   But as with any choice, you quickly become accustomed to whatever the lifestyle is that
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:49.260]   you've ended up with.
[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:57.700]   And so if you're thinking about buying a brand new car, and you're dreaming about it, buying
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:00.900]   that car just feels like something you've got to have.
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:04.580]   And so then you go and buy the car, and you love it for the first weeks, first months,
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:05.580]   et cetera.
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:08.620]   And then after a few months, the emotions taper off, and you realize, hey, I'm really
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.180]   glad I've got this car.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:11.180]   Or you know what?
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:13.900]   I could have done without this car, but it works.
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:14.900]   It's fine.
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:20.840]   So in terms of moving to places, my choice A is keep the job, keep the great income,
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:25.540]   keep stacking money, because it's going to massively increase your footprint in the world.
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:30.780]   Number two is, if necessary, try to see, can we get something that will satisfice for the
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:33.200]   situation, Puerto Rico, et cetera.
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:37.320]   Number three is go for a year and build a vision, but don't burn any bridges.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:40.360]   And then number four is, OK, we really want to do this.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:44.800]   Let's walk away, because we're definitely going to start a vineyard in Chile, or whatever
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.800]   it is.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.240]   In that case, that's why you became financially independent in the first place.
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:54.520]   And then probably then in that situation, the question is, how can you use your current
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:58.560]   job, your current connections, et cetera, and set up a new opportunity that pays you
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:02.360]   very well with a lifestyle that you like, but that just doesn't have the contractual
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.880]   limitations and they're totally fine with your living in Argentina.
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:08.080]   But those are some ideas that hopefully will get you started.
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.080]   Thank you, Joshua.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:13.120]   Joshua, do you have time for another quick question?
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:14.120]   Very quickly.
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:15.120]   Yes.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:16.120]   Yep.
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:22.560]   Joshua, so I'm in tech sector, one of the fan companies, if you will.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:28.920]   And I'm finding that because a lot of people I work with are immigrants like myself, our
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:33.720]   English is, I mean, don't get me wrong, I have a master's in engineering and so forth.
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:37.200]   So reading English is fine, like comprehending English is fine.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:42.600]   But I'm finding that a higher echelon, my speaking English, the way I communicate, needs
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:43.600]   to get better.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:46.760]   I've heard of Toastmasters before, I've tried to join them.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:48.200]   They're just not quick enough for me.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:53.480]   What I mean is I'd rather just pay someone, like a personal coach, who would just coach
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.800]   me in expressing myself better.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.940]   Could you give me some ideas around that?
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:02.160]   Is your concern your ability to formulate and clearly express ideas?
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.760]   Or is your concern the very light, non-standard accent that you have?
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:12.200]   Actually, I'm not worried about the accent, but I'm interested in, let's say, speaking
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:20.760]   off the cuff, right, which I struggle or I just mask it by just making silly jokes, right?
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:24.200]   Because I feel like in tech sector, we don't need to be as smooth as, let's say, a lawyer.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:30.280]   My concern is just speaking articulately, like a lawyer, let's say.
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:36.320]   Well, first, with regard to accent, you don't have in any way an objectionable accent.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:44.660]   And I think in general, having a native-sounding accent is not necessarily an important goal.
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:48.480]   And in some cases, it can be actually counterproductive.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:51.040]   So I don't think you should worry too much about accent.
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.620]   Your accent is perfectly understandable.
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:30:01.120]   I can quickly detect that you're not a native U.S. American speaker of English, but I can't,
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:06.240]   it's not so thick that I can place it easily and obviously, and it doesn't hamper communication.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:07.240]   That's the goal.
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:10.560]   You don't want an accent that's so thick that people have to work really hard to understand
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:11.680]   it.
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:14.420]   But a little bit of trace of an accent is no problem.
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:19.160]   On the topic of accent, though, if you want to moderate your accent, I think there are
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:21.240]   a couple of things that you can do.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:26.360]   For one, I think a lot of accent seems to be related to your willingness to embrace
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.600]   the culture that you're trying to model.
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:36.480]   I haven't experienced this myself with regard to language acquisition, but I have found
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:43.320]   a number of people who confirm this, that in essence, people who are able to acquire
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:50.760]   a native-sounding accent are people who are happy to be associated with the host culture,
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:55.480]   the culture of the accent that they're trying to acquire.
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:31:01.120]   And I think this is one of the reasons that children, generally speaking, acquire a better
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:08.360]   accent or a more native-sounding accent than adults do, that children don't have preconceived
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:14.960]   ideas about not wanting to associate with this particular culture, and so therefore
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:17.240]   they just speak the way that locals speak.
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.080]   And I think that adults can do that as well.
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:25.360]   I've found many language learners who have developed a native or nearly native accent,
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:29.680]   even though they learned a language as adults, but what they have in common is that they
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:35.000]   embrace the culture of that language, and they want to be identified with those people.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.800]   And if somebody doesn't have, if somebody has a very thick non-native accent, I think
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:45.440]   in many cases they don't really want to be identified with the culture, and they prefer
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:49.240]   to maintain, whether they know it or not, they prefer to maintain a little bit of their
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:50.920]   independence.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:57.320]   Regarding accent, accent training can be done, it's something that can be done yourself intentionally,
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.720]   and it's something that can be done with a coach.
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:01.640]   You can find an accent coach.
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:06.320]   Usually they work in acting circles, et cetera, they're acting coaches.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.840]   But I have a book that I've looked at for accent training, and it teaches you how to
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:10.880]   do all the different accents.
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:14.640]   I haven't done anything with it, but I've always wanted to be able to put on various
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:19.920]   accents when I wanted to, and it's a trainable skill, and it's a trainable skill for you
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:20.960]   as well.
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:26.560]   And it largely would involve finding a speaker, starting off without hiring a coach, what
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:33.520]   I would encourage you to do is find an English speaker that you respect, that you want to
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:38.520]   model, and then find a dialogue from that English speaker that you really like, break
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:45.640]   it up into parts, and then listen to it, and record yourself speaking the text or the words
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:49.720]   that the speaker that you admire, that speaks the way you want to speak, would speak them,
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:56.800]   and then listen to them, compare them, correct as appropriate.
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:02.680]   And I think that that exercise, if you put 50 or 100 hours into that, would adjust your
[01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:05.000]   â€“ and then also a little bit of formalized study.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:12.040]   You sound like you might be Indian, what are the vowels that Indian speakers, or the consonants
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:16.080]   that Indian speakers struggle with because of their native language?
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:20.440]   And then what are the new vowel sounds in the language that I'm trying to target?
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:21.440]   Why is this?
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:25.600]   Because the reason we have accents, and the reason that if I could do an Indian accent,
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:30.560]   or a German accent, or a British accent, you can immediately â€“ excuse me, I meant a German
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:36.040]   accent or a French accent, all of the traces of accent have to do with the native language,
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.760]   and the native grammar.
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:41.200]   And so if I were trying to put on a German accent, I would change my word order, I would
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:47.840]   say â€“ I would use since instead of â€“ all the things that German speakers do, and then
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.960]   use all the vowel sounds that come from the native language.
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:55.320]   So once you identify those, then you can practice them, and instead of saying the soft R, you
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:00.040]   say the English-sounding R, and those kinds of things that can be done just with a little
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:01.040]   bit of focus.
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.160]   So 50 or 100 hours there would change it.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:09.360]   With regard to being articulate, and especially in an extemporaneous circumstance, I think
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:14.480]   part of that is practice, and that's where opportunities like Toastmasters, et cetera,
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.040]   are useful.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:20.440]   Where you have an opportunity to practice speaking in an extemporaneous way.
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:26.680]   But I think it's more important to go slow in order to go fast.
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:34.720]   And what I mean is when I am articulate, especially in an extemporaneous format like I'm speaking
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:40.960]   to you right now, it's not because I have some unique skill of being able to formulate
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:45.240]   my ideas, sentences, and words clearly just off the cuff.
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:50.720]   Rather, it's that I know a lot about what I'm talking about, and I've thought a lot
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.880]   about what I'm talking about.
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:56.340]   And if you're talking about something that you know a lot about, and have thought a lot
[01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:59.880]   about, then speaking about that subject is not difficult.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:06.080]   The little monologue that I just gave you regarding accent coaching and accent formation
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:12.960]   did not come out in a hopefully coherent and smooth way because I have a unique skill of
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:14.120]   speaking extemporaneously.
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:19.160]   Rather, it came out because this is a subject that I know something about, it's a subject
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:23.280]   that I have an interest in, it's a subject that I've had questions on and I've dug into
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:27.360]   the details, I've dug into the research, and as a result, it's fairly straightforward
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:31.840]   and simple for me to say the three or four points that I want to say.
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:36.860]   And so I think there's real value in going slow to go fast.
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:42.320]   And so if I wanted to be more articulate, I would spend more time thinking and probably
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:49.600]   writing, because the skill of being able to articulate your thoughts verbally clearly
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:54.000]   is primarily a skill of having thoughts that are worth making verbal.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.000]   And that means that you should dedicate time to practicing forming the language in an effective
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.120]   way.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:07.720]   And if you can't do that quickly, then do it slowly.
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:11.680]   And as you do it slowly over time, you'll get better at doing it quickly.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:15.680]   So I would start with a series of topics.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:21.980]   Choose a time in which you recently found yourself at a loss for words and didn't know
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:23.360]   what to say.
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:27.400]   Think of what the subject was, and then write about that subject.
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:31.100]   And create a little paragraph saying, "Here's what I think."
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:39.320]   When I speak extemporaneously, in essence, I'm going through a catalog of ideas that
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:41.000]   I have developed.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.120]   These are ideas that have come to me from thinking about questions, trying to understand
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:51.400]   what an answer to those questions is, formulating an answer to those questions, and cataloging
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.420]   it away in my brain.
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:59.460]   So earlier in this call, when a listener called me and asked me about, "I'm expecting a baby,"
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:04.620]   I gave the speech that anybody who's listened to previous speeches that I've given on this
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:08.100]   particular topic would recognize the basic points of that.
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:12.320]   Because in my mind, I basically have this catalog of 8 to 15 points, depending on how
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:18.440]   much time, and I have a depth of content behind them or a shortness of content that I can
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:22.360]   stretch or shorten up, depending on the context.
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:24.640]   And I've given this speech a dozen times.
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:28.920]   Most of those times being in personal interaction, etc.
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:30.560]   Some of those times publicly.
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:34.600]   And so while not everything is going to fit into that, I think that when you have a catalog
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:41.480]   of ideas, or we could call them stump speeches, then you can then be creative from those.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:45.840]   And so let's use a metaphor or just another field that we could look at this.
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:52.880]   If you study something like jazz, jazz music, jazz music to an untrained observer seems
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:57.200]   like complete improvisation, like it's just being made up on the spot.
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:59.180]   But that's not actually true.
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:04.080]   Jazz is indeed improvisation, but the whole structure of improvisation is built upon the
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.480]   basic structure of that style of music.
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:11.480]   And so there are certain things that don't change, and then within those rules, then
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:16.040]   the jazz musician improvises while not necessarily breaking those rules.
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:20.520]   And when he breaks those rules, he's conscious of the fact that he's breaking a certain rule
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:23.640]   or a certain pattern, and he does that for effect.
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:24.880]   A politician will do this.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.800]   If you watch a politician speak, if you ever travel around for a couple days with a politician,
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:30.080]   they have a stump speech.
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:34.460]   And they say the same basic five points at every speech, but they adjust it a little
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:36.280]   bit here and there, etc.
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:43.040]   And so I think before I would go and try to hire a coach, a speaking coach, I would first
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.760]   work on building skill with communicating my ideas.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:53.360]   And when you build skill at communicating ideas, do that slowly using writing, and then
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:59.780]   practice those skills in verbal contexts when you have those.
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:03.420]   And I give you just one final piece of evidence for this.
[01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:10.000]   This is exactly the same skill that a dedicated language learner applies when building skill
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.360]   in a foreign language.
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:16.280]   A dedicated language learner who has skill and experience with language learning will
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:22.680]   choose a certain number of domains about which he wants to become skilled in speaking.
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:28.400]   And if he wants toâ€”and the proper term here for what we're talking about is fluency.
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:32.600]   And I use the term fluency, especially in a foreign language context.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:40.900]   What I refer to is the ability to communicate ideas in a fluid, flowing manner.
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:42.060]   That's fluency.
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:45.760]   Fluency doesn't mean that you know everything about a subject, doesn't imply a certain number
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:49.280]   of ideas or a certain amount of vocabulary that you require.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:54.300]   It simply refers to your ability to fluidly convey your ideas.
[01:39:54.300 --> 01:40:00.560]   And so if you want to develop fluency in a foreign language, you begin by learning the
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:02.480]   vocabulary of a certain domain.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:07.480]   And so, for example, a foreign language learner will start with very simple things like, "You're
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:08.480]   speaking Spanish.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:11.200]   Well, why are you studying Spanish?"
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:15.840]   And that language learner will go to a translator, a Google translator, a chat GPT or something,
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:17.680]   and create a series of sentences.
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.280]   "Here's why I'm studying Spanish.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.240]   I've been studying Spanish for this amount of time.
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.880]   Here's how I'm studying Spanish.
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:25.640]   How did you learn Spanish?" or whatever the version is.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:30.400]   Or they'll develop kind of a set of lines about their job, "I'm from this place.
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:31.520]   I do this thing.
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:32.880]   I'm this number of years old.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:35.200]   I have this number of children," et cetera.
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:39.040]   And they'll write out those sentences and they'll study just those sentences.
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:43.480]   Then when the occasion calls for it, they can articulate those sentences because they
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:45.560]   know those sentences very well.
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:47.560]   They're not fluent in every domain.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:52.840]   They're not fluent enough to talk about quantum mechanics, but I'm fluent and able to talk
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:56.680]   about where I'm from and why I like traveling in Latin America.
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:01.440]   And so then over time, you expand your domains of knowledge and the different areas in which
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:06.000]   you can articulate those concepts, and that's how you build verbal fluency.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.560]   But you do it by slowing down, writing things out, communicating, and then reflecting on
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.840]   that language that you're trying to create.
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:17.840]   Then when you're in the opportunity or when you're in the moment, then you can articulate
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.840]   those things.
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:24.520]   And finally, I would say that if there's something that's very high pressure, if there's a conversation
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:30.960]   or an event or an occasion that really is going to call for top performance, then you
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:34.840]   should have your commentary memorized.
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:40.020]   And so many of us in today's world have become quite lazy about learning to memorize.
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:42.960]   And so our memory muscles have atrophied significantly.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:48.140]   But you can build those memory muscles up and memorize the texts, memorize the things
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:49.880]   that you want to say.
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:54.400]   And in essence, what I do here on Radical Personal Finance is that I've memorized my
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.160]   ideas about certain things, and I just deliver the same speech over and over again.
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:02.520]   When I was a financial advisor, actively selling financial products, et cetera, I was always
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:04.520]   working with memorized speeches.
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:06.200]   I would memorize my approach language.
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:09.920]   What do I say when I walk into someone's office and for the first time I'm going to just ask
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:10.920]   you about your money?
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:12.640]   I had those speeches memorized.
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:15.240]   I had an answer prepared for every single objection.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.060]   "Well, Joshua, it's too expensive.
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:18.640]   What about term versus whole life?"
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:22.920]   Or, "I don't really need this," or "I'll just end my life.
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:26.800]   Why would I need long-term care when I got a revolver in the bedroom drawer?"
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:32.040]   And so every single thing I would ever say in those sales contexts was basically memorized.
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:36.860]   And in some cases, it was memorized proactively because I sat down and I thought about what
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:39.320]   I would say or how I would respond to that objection.
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:43.560]   In many cases, it was memorized reactively, meaning someone would give me an objection,
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:47.660]   I would stumble through it, and then I would take it home and think about how to say it
[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:51.920]   better and create a better solution, and then try it out the next time around, next time
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:55.040]   I got that objection, and then just deliver that again and again.
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:59.640]   And so to me, I think this is going to be your most productive approach is understand
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:05.640]   what you believe, build practice slowly saying what you want to say, and then the verbal
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:09.380]   fluency that you desire to have will be there when you're ready for it to be there.
[01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:11.580]   All right, it actually looks like he dropped off.
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:12.580]   No problem.
[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:14.580]   So usually people mute themselves and they come back.
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:19.580]   Let me go on to several of you had jumped off earlier when I came to you.

[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:52.240]   wrong too many times for me to have any confidence in my prognostication.
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:58.680]   I do think that you should listen to your local market and so the reason that I have
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:07.720]   been wrong about a lot of my personal bets and predictions is that I have been predicting
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:14.120]   across a country, an enormous country with 380 million people, all of whom are interacting
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:18.040]   with each other and so I've had almost no ability to get that right.
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:22.560]   But I think on a local basis, you do have more ability to get it right and the people
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:29.160]   who are on the ground and people who are facing things know something about the local market
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:32.160]   and local markets are somewhat predictable.
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:36.980]   And so my first response would be what do you think is going to happen in your local
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:44.400]   market based upon the trends that you see, based upon the volume of sales, the days on
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:51.840]   market, all of the basic numbers that you see, you should do a little bit of predicting
[01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:56.840]   and you should do it with a specific eye towards the data, not just what does your real estate
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:59:03.120]   agent say, that's a good source of feedback, but more a matter of the actual data of your
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:04.160]   area.
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:09.120]   So if you haven't cultivated a source of data for your county, your city, whatever the area
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:15.080]   that you're targeting is, cultivate a source of data and look for a group of some kind
[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:17.240]   of people who are paying attention to this.
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:22.200]   Look for a real estate investors club, look for an online group, look for a sub-forum
[01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:27.080]   in a real estate group somewhere, look for just conversations on Facebook, start a conversation
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:31.520]   about what's happening in a local area and try to develop a little bit of a prediction
[01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:33.600]   for your own area.
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:41.040]   In doing that, you should arrive at an assessment of the long-term potential of this area.
[01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:46.400]   And I think that in many cases, if you're buying into an area that has a stable base
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:56.920]   underneath it, of attractive qualities underneath it, then overbuying a house because it's the
[01:59:56.920 --> 02:00:04.080]   right thing for your family and experiencing a temporary pinch in your finances turns out
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:07.380]   to be the right move in the fullness of time.
[02:00:07.380 --> 02:00:12.960]   If we go back and we calculate the times where it turned out to be a mistake to buy real
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:19.360]   estate as compared with the times that turned out to be a smart choice to buy real estate.
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:22.680]   Smart choice wins out a huge portion of the time.
[02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:27.920]   And in any case in which it was a mistake, it was really only a mistake in the short
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:28.920]   term.
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:36.080]   So, I started my financial advisor career in 2008 in the middle of one of the world's
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:40.280]   greatest collapses of real estate in South Florida.
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:46.200]   And it was insane how many people I knew who went bankrupt with real estate and how they
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:49.840]   were selling their houses at 50% below what they paid for them, just a complete and total
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:50.840]   collapse.
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:57.660]   But anybody who held on for, I mean, even only four or five years was able to get out.
[02:00:57.660 --> 02:01:06.680]   And then today, more than 10 years, but 15 years later, then everything is squared away.
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:08.760]   That's not a universal case though, right?
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:12.960]   If you bought into, say, a place where all the industry was leaving, somewhere in the
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:18.680]   rust belt, et cetera, and you bought this big home because you thought the things were
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:22.880]   going to be there, and it turns out there was no economic strength underneath the area,
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:26.240]   then yeah, the home values would never come back.
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:30.520]   But I guess the bias is that if you're buying a house because you need the space in order
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:36.320]   to raise a child, then there's a good chance that you're in it for a 10-year deal.
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:42.020]   And overbuying on your personal house does have a useful investment component to it.
[02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:46.120]   It's not all consumption, especially if you're buying a good neighborhood, a good area that
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:53.320]   has good structure and good demand for those houses.
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:58.800]   And if you wind up being a little bit house poor for three or four years, and then you're
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:05.080]   not so house poor, then that kind of works out pretty well with when all of a sudden
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.160]   your other expenses start to increase, and just due to the natural rates of inflation,
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:10.160]   et cetera.
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:14.640]   So I think our bias always has to be in favor of buying a property if we can find a way
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:16.280]   to swing it.
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:22.520]   And you should know your local market to see, is there something that could happen in 2024?
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:25.240]   But our bias should be in favor of buying.
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:28.720]   When you're buying for a reason like you're describing, I need a house to raise my children
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:33.360]   in, you're not dependent on short-term swings, short-term moves.
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:37.760]   What you are dependent on is figuring out how to get a house to work.
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:44.280]   And so yes, maybe you tried 15 times, but there are plenty of houses and your requirements
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:48.040]   are probably not so unique that there aren't plenty of other houses.
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:53.580]   And so I would focus on, with each loss of a house, I would focus on saying, "How could
[02:02:53.580 --> 02:02:59.080]   I make my contract more appealing in the future?"
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:03.800]   If possible, I would stop all other investing just to pile up more money so I could make
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:06.760]   a bigger down payment or whatever was needed to make the numbers work.
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:08.360]   I think those are your obvious solutions.
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:12.880]   Of course, if you can make more money, do that as a temporary thing.
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:17.480]   And then try to figure out, "How could I make my contract more appealing?"
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:21.840]   But I've worked with a lot of real estate investors who the idea of making 15 offers
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:27.220]   on a house and then not a single one be accepted is not really that big of a deal.
[02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:32.640]   So I think in summary, I'm trying to give you some pointers without being too specific,
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:38.000]   but my bias should be in favor of buying and do everything I can to free up money, live
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.480]   frugally so I can put more down, close faster, figure out what is working in the current
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:47.760]   market and then be ready for the 2024 season and then see what happens.
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:52.560]   But if it takes you a year to buy a house or two years to buy a house, but you get a
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:57.840]   house that works for you for the long term, then that to me is still a win.
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:00.440]   Was that too vague or is that something to go on?
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:02.000]   Yeah, so it's a little general.
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:05.480]   I was hoping for something a little bit more specific.
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:09.920]   I suppose, let me ask maybe a more specific question.
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:10.920]   Please.
[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:17.360]   At what point does it become too much house, I guess, is maybe a good way of thinking about
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:18.360]   it, right?
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:23.280]   I mean, where do I have to draw the line and stand because, I mean, I'm going to throw
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:27.800]   out real, these are public numbers, but in some of these houses, people are bidding over
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:33.520]   half a million dollars over AFT and I'm not talking about McMansion here, right?
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:36.480]   And we're losing by miles.
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:40.640]   And I guess the question is, where do I draw that line and stand for me?
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:42.200]   Percentages would be great.
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:47.440]   If you need net worth, I can throw that out there, but where do I draw that sign of like,
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:53.120]   where do I get uncomfortable knowing that I've overextended in the house?
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:56.760]   I would draw the line of saying, number one, if it were me, I would only ever calculate
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:57.920]   on my income.
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:02.640]   So I wouldn't buy a house depending on my wife's income because I want her to be a mother
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:06.160]   and that probably means that I can afford less house than a lot of other people who
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:08.200]   have a dual income.
[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:16.680]   Number two is I would take a very careful look at what my cash flow needs are.
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:24.000]   So a guy who has no debt and who makes a high income could put 50% of his income into a
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.480]   housing payment and be fine.
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:30.120]   A guy who's got a lot of other payments and even if he had the same income and a lower
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:32.680]   income, for him, 20% would be too much.
[02:05:32.680 --> 02:05:38.400]   So I'm fine with like, there's the useful ratios of 25, 30, 35% of income, that's pretty
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:40.280]   much the standard advice.
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:42.160]   That's fine, but that's not all-encompassing.
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:46.720]   I would look at my personal budget and, again, the guy who makes a lot of money and doesn't
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:50.720]   have any other payments and isn't going out looking for payments could afford to put a
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:54.480]   higher percentage of income towards a personal house than the other.
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:59.120]   But if you're uncomfortable with it, what I would say is that having a larger house
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:03.200]   doesn't solve anything with children, especially in the early years.
[02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:12.120]   And so I would wait because in the beginning, they don't actually take that much space.
[02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:20.280]   But I can't give you the specific answer you're asking me for because there are too many variables.
[02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:24.720]   So I apologize for being vague, but I'm not comfortable giving like a personal answer
[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:28.020]   because we're all different.
[02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:32.960]   And so I can tell you what I would do, but if you're uncomfortable, don't do it.
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:34.360]   Just wait.
[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:37.940]   Because if you're a well-employed professional, there's got to be a solution in the local
[02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:42.200]   market that works for you in the fullness of time.
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:46.320]   And if you're in a market where there's just nothing you can afford, then you should seriously
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:48.620]   consider quitting that market and going somewhere else.
[02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:57.040]   But markets don't stay irrational forever.
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:00.140]   At a point in time, they have to become rational.
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:06.440]   There is an adjustment factor because what happens is real estate prices and normal people
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:13.080]   being able to live in an area that they can sit, there can be normal people who are able
[02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:16.780]   to afford a house because they lived in the house for the last 20 years.
[02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:20.780]   And their house price, they would never be able to afford to get back into that market,
[02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:23.560]   but they can sit in that market because they've been there for 20 years, but somebody coming
[02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:29.700]   into that market can't get in because the prices are completely out of whack.
[02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:37.880]   So I don't like to fail you, but I can't give you more specifics.
[02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:38.880]   Thank you, Joshua.
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:39.880]   Thank you.
[02:07:39.880 --> 02:07:42.280]   I call it because these are tough questions, right?
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:43.280]   It is.
[02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:48.420]   And hence why, hey, right, these are not easy situations for any of us.
[02:07:48.420 --> 02:07:54.260]   And ultimately, you know, I'm not giving a ton of personal situation, you know, details
[02:07:54.260 --> 02:07:55.260]   of my situation.
[02:07:55.260 --> 02:08:00.620]   It's a question because some of the best advice I've ever given in my life has come from third
[02:08:00.620 --> 02:08:05.120]   party individuals, right, such as yourself, you know, over a phone call.
[02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:10.080]   And those individuals often don't know that they're giving good advice until years later.
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:15.160]   But I find sometimes I need a different perspective and that's what you're providing me.
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:19.000]   And quite frankly, even your comments here are giving me things to think about in a different
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.000]   way.
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:25.140]   And I appreciate you, you know, giving your opinion and advice on this.
[02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:26.140]   So I do.
[02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:29.340]   I'll call in again and later with different questions in the future.
[02:08:29.340 --> 02:08:30.340]   But thank you.
[02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:31.340]   I know you have other calls online.
[02:08:31.340 --> 02:08:34.160]   I won't be respectful, but thank you.
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:36.740]   And it's been a pleasure speaking to you after 10 years of listening.
[02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:38.180]   I appreciate your being here.
[02:08:38.180 --> 02:08:47.100]   I guess the point I would leave you on would be to say that affordability in a strong market
[02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:54.540]   with a strong foundation, with strong desirability, with a strong house, affordability is often
[02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:57.060]   a temporary phenomenon.
[02:08:57.060 --> 02:09:04.380]   And the variability, if you're being outbid on a house that's way out in the suburbs of
[02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:08.660]   a city that's kind of mediocre, well, I would be very concerned about overbidding on that.
[02:09:08.660 --> 02:09:12.740]   If you're bidding on a house that's right in the center of a city that has a long history,
[02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:20.180]   strong local economy, etc., and you're bidding at a level that's uncomfortable for you for
[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:27.340]   a few years, to me, I'm still willing to push that comfort level, recognizing that after
[02:09:27.340 --> 02:09:30.180]   a few years things will probably change.
[02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:39.480]   And I wish I could make a prediction on the 2024 markets, I wish I could make a prediction
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:44.960]   on interest rates, I wish I could make comments on some of that stuff, but I'm uncomfortable
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:51.020]   doing so, and I think it's important to be careful and just focus primarily on the personal
[02:09:51.020 --> 02:09:52.020]   situation.
[02:09:52.020 --> 02:09:53.020]   All right.
[02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:54.020]   Move to Kilgore, Texas.
[02:09:54.020 --> 02:09:55.020]   Welcome to the show.
[02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:56.020]   How can I serve you today?
[02:09:56.020 --> 02:09:57.020]   Oops.
[02:09:57.020 --> 02:09:58.020]   Thank you for taking my call.
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:09:59.020]   Can you hear me?
[02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:00.020]   Yes.
[02:10:00.020 --> 02:10:01.020]   I'm sorry.
[02:10:01.020 --> 02:10:02.020]   I'd forgotten to unmute you.
[02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:03.020]   So tell me your name again, please.
[02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:04.020]   Oh, my name's Nicole.
[02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:05.020]   Nicole, welcome.
[02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:06.020]   How can I serve you today?
[02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:11.940]   So I had a question, Joshua, similar to the previous caller, it's about a housing situation.
[02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:16.140]   Can I just give you a quick rundown of our finances?
[02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:17.140]   Please.
[02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:23.980]   So we have about $90,000 saved, our annual income is about $70,000, so that is mostly
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:28.980]   my husband's income, and we're not looking to relocate because he works in-person and
[02:10:28.980 --> 02:10:29.980]   he enjoys the job.
[02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:33.700]   I don't know if I said we don't have any debt.
[02:10:33.700 --> 02:10:37.120]   Our current rent is about $700,000, and it's in a relatively safe area.
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:41.900]   The only difference is we have a child and are expecting more, and it's just a two-bed,
[02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:42.900]   one-bath.
[02:10:42.900 --> 02:10:48.740]   So we are looking to get a house in the future, but in our area, we've noticed prices have
[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:55.180]   gone up, I think about $50,000 to $100,000 in just a few years.
[02:10:55.180 --> 02:11:01.620]   So our concern is that we would like to buy a house with as big of a down payment as possible,
[02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:05.460]   just to reduce the amount that we pay in interest, but our concern is if we keep waiting for
[02:11:05.460 --> 02:11:12.060]   years to save up $150,000, something like that, to get a house that we'd be happy with,
[02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:14.180]   we're worried that the market's going to keep outstripping us.
[02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:18.340]   Do you have any input on that calculation or in terms of what we should do as a first-time
[02:11:18.340 --> 02:11:20.860]   homebuyer?
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:28.060]   I don't believe that the future of the market should be a primary factor of analysis in
[02:11:28.060 --> 02:11:30.060]   a situation like you're describing.
[02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:33.020]   I don't deny that it's unimportant.
[02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:37.660]   If any of us could predict the market, then wouldn't that be wonderful, it'd be great.
[02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:41.220]   We'd all buy options contracts on all the houses in our market and make a bundle.
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:46.900]   But it's famously difficult to predict, especially in the world of real estate, because it reflects
[02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:53.860]   "the market" simply reflects the thousands and thousands and thousands of individual
[02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:58.620]   decisions made by this buyer, this seller, this buyer, this seller, and people buy and
[02:11:58.620 --> 02:12:01.780]   sell for any number of reasons.
[02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:04.340]   So what could we stand on?
[02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:08.500]   If we can't stand on the prediction of the market or prognostication, what could we stand
[02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:09.500]   on?
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:11.780]   Well, I think we could stand on personal financial planning.
[02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:16.020]   And how I would define that would be to say, "Do we need a house?"
[02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:20.180]   If we have a baby and we're having more, probably yes.
[02:12:20.180 --> 02:12:24.980]   Obviously people could raise their children in $700 a month apartments, but the quality
[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:29.460]   of life that you're going to experience probably being proved significantly by being in a house
[02:12:29.460 --> 02:12:31.300]   that serves you.
[02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:35.820]   And so we want to look around and say, "Is buying a house good for us?"
[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:41.420]   Now when buying a house, for this reason, it's a fairly stable thing.
[02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:45.740]   When people buy houses because they're having babies, they're probably going to be somewhere
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:47.580]   for a significant period of time.
[02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:50.340]   Ten years is kind of a minimum plan.
[02:12:50.340 --> 02:12:54.320]   You can understand that things might change when my child is a teenager, but if you're
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:58.340]   buying a house to have children in, you can probably plan for the long term.
[02:12:58.340 --> 02:13:01.020]   You're planning on a 10-year ownership.
[02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:06.260]   And even when you have 10 years, the whole idea of market changes go out the window.
[02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:08.020]   It's not that big of a deal.
[02:13:08.020 --> 02:13:12.940]   If you reflect back on what a house that you're considering cost 10 years ago as to now, you'll
[02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:17.740]   see that the long-term trend is what it is, and the short-term ups and downs of $50,000
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:20.820]   here, $50,000 there, is not that big of a deal.
[02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:24.660]   So to me, these are good reasons for you to buy a house.
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:28.660]   In addition, you're obviously prepared financially to buy a house.
[02:13:28.660 --> 02:13:33.300]   You have no debt, you have savings, and you have a stable income.
[02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:35.260]   And you want to buy a house for lifestyle reasons.
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:38.020]   So all of that would say that you should buy a house.
[02:13:38.020 --> 02:13:44.900]   Now in terms of what you can afford, you have to go and look in the market, run the numbers,
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:48.900]   talk to a mortgage broker, see what you can afford in terms of a mortgage, look at all
[02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:55.260]   the alternatives, right, could we do a $70,000, could we buy a $40,000 piece of land and get
[02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:59.100]   a shed from Home Depot for $20,000 and fix it up ourselves and live in that?
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:00.740]   Are you those kinds of people?
[02:14:00.740 --> 02:14:04.900]   Assuming that you're not kind of unusual radicals in some way.
[02:14:04.900 --> 02:14:08.980]   That actually is one of our interests, actually just what you said, we were trying to think
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:09.980]   of different ways.
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:14.060]   So I'm open to that, but that's usually going to be, if that's the kind of people you are,
[02:14:14.060 --> 02:14:18.220]   you're the kind of people who would buy a piece of land, live in an RV on it for a while,
[02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:21.860]   put up a tiny house, expand over time, that's awesome.
[02:14:21.860 --> 02:14:26.940]   And that's a very different set of decisions though than the normal path that I'm going
[02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:31.660]   down, which is to say, you're going to buy a conventional home in a suburb somewhere,
[02:14:31.660 --> 02:14:32.660]   etc.
[02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:37.020]   And if you are committed to being debt-free, then it's just a matter of, is there land
[02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:38.820]   that has zoning that I need?
[02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:44.700]   Could we build a tiny house or a barn dominium, or what are they called, you know, a metal
[02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:45.700]   shed?
[02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:46.700]   Exactly what you mean.
[02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:47.700]   Yeah.
[02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:50.580]   Like, is there some unique thing that we could do?
[02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:51.980]   And I would say, go for it.
[02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:55.480]   In that case, then yeah, you should just go with what you can pay cash for.
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:58.660]   You should go ahead and do that if you're those kinds of people.
[02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:01.700]   Not many people are those kinds of people, which is why I usually give the more conventional
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:02.700]   advice.
[02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:05.860]   But in your situation, if that's you, then I would say if there's any way to make it
[02:15:05.860 --> 02:15:06.860]   work, then go for it.
[02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:11.820]   Because not having a mortgage and if you're adventurous enough to do that kind of stuff,
[02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:13.260]   you guys can totally win doing that.
[02:15:13.260 --> 02:15:16.300]   It's just a matter of, can you find a piece of land that works, etc.
[02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:17.300]   That's good.
[02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:18.300]   Yeah.
[02:15:18.300 --> 02:15:22.100]   Definitely our priorities are staying debt-free and just, we really want land to enjoy the
[02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:23.100]   outdoors.
[02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:25.900]   We're not so big on the suburbs or anything like that.
[02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:26.900]   Okay.
[02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:31.780]   So here's, I think this relates then, this is what I was going to say, is that I believe
[02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:38.140]   that when you're buying a house, either your down payment should be as small as possible
[02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:40.340]   or you should pay cash.
[02:15:40.340 --> 02:15:41.340]   Either one.
[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:43.500]   There's enormous value to both of them.
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:48.980]   But the idea of saying, "I'm going to save up from $90,000 to $150,000," so that I can
[02:15:48.980 --> 02:15:52.140]   â€“ let's assume that you were less radical and more conventional.
[02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:56.140]   Let's assume that you were going to go and buy a $300,000 house.
[02:15:56.140 --> 02:16:00.020]   If you call me and say, "Joshua, we're going to buy a $300,000 house.
[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:04.820]   Should we just go with our down payment of $90,000 that we have saved or should we sit
[02:16:04.820 --> 02:16:10.540]   for another two or three years and save $150,000 so we can make a $150,000 down payment?"
[02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:11.540]   My answer is no.
[02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:17.220]   Buy a house now because there's no â€“ you're better off putting a small of a down payment
[02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:23.220]   down so that you have maximum flexibility and get as big of a mortgage as possible rather
[02:16:23.220 --> 02:16:28.980]   than saving for a few more years so you can make a $150,000 down payment on a $300,000
[02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:29.980]   house.
[02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.900]   Now, if you're committed to being debt-free, then I'm all in.
[02:16:32.900 --> 02:16:33.900]   Great.
[02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:36.940]   That's the other one that's really valuable because someone who's genuinely debt-free
[02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:41.140]   and who's committed to staying debt-free, you're going to have such an enormous benefit
[02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:45.160]   from life for that that you keep it up.
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:47.980]   Either you put a small of a down payment down as possible or you pay cash.
[02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:53.140]   If you're going to pay cash, then your budget is determined by what cash you have.
[02:16:53.140 --> 02:16:58.260]   That's a matter of is there some way that we can find to make this work.
[02:16:58.260 --> 02:17:00.420]   Then you look at is there a piece of land?
[02:17:00.420 --> 02:17:01.420]   What are the land prices?
[02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:02.420]   How much land?
[02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:04.100]   What are the costs, et cetera?
[02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:08.580]   Then is there a way that we can get onto the property in a somewhat uncomfortable way while
[02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:12.220]   we're building and saving for our dream house?
[02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:16.780]   Your rent is very, very modest so you can still save money, but if you can get onto
[02:17:16.780 --> 02:17:21.140]   the land and start improving the land and there's some path where you pay $50,000 for
[02:17:21.140 --> 02:17:26.380]   a piece of land, you buy a $15,000 or $20,000 trailer, you move onto it, you start putting
[02:17:26.380 --> 02:17:30.500]   in your gardens, you start putting in your trees, et cetera, and then you start building
[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:38.460]   a house over time using recycled materials, doing it inexpensively, doing whatever kind
[02:17:38.460 --> 02:17:39.460]   of methodology.
[02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:40.460]   I'm all in favor.
[02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:44.100]   Then yes, if you're committed to going debt-free, I'm with you and you should just set your
[02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:45.740]   budget based upon how much money you have.
[02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:49.180]   If you don't have enough money to do something that makes sense, then yes, you should wait
[02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:51.780]   a few more years until you have money to make sense.
[02:17:51.780 --> 02:17:57.380]   Recognize that in your scenario, if you're going to operate on cash, your particular
[02:17:57.380 --> 02:18:02.460]   decisions will not flow with the rest of the market because you're operating based upon
[02:18:02.460 --> 02:18:03.460]   cash.
[02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:08.380]   So what's affordable for you is very different than what's affordable for other people.
[02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:11.460]   You don't have many competitors.
[02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:16.100]   You're just not in the same world as your neighbor who's going out and buying a house
[02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:17.400]   with a mortgage.
[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:19.220]   You don't have to worry about interest rates.
[02:18:19.220 --> 02:18:22.300]   You don't have to worry about any of this stuff because you're paying cash.
[02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:25.980]   You're in a very different world that's much more a matter of is there a lifestyle or a
[02:18:25.980 --> 02:18:29.220]   certain type of house that we could build based upon the money we have, how could we
[02:18:29.220 --> 02:18:31.500]   get into it as quickly as possible, etc.
[02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:34.420]   Okay, thank you very much.
[02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:37.180]   Could I ask you a book recommendation as well?
[02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:38.180]   Sure, go ahead.
[02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:41.740]   Both my husband and I have only ever earned income from an employer and we're interested
[02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:47.340]   in learning more about how to gain income separate from the employer.
[02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:52.740]   Do you have any book recommendations or ideas of where to start in terms of learning how
[02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:53.740]   to use our skills?
[02:18:53.740 --> 02:19:00.940]   Or like as a third, not changing our income but like an additional income stream.
[02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:02.940]   Understood.
[02:19:02.940 --> 02:19:07.900]   I don't have a book recommendation off the bat because that's such a broad general topic.
[02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:11.260]   What I would say is look around your personal life.
[02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:16.900]   Find someone that you know and admire who does this and then spend the money you would
[02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:21.820]   spend on a book taking that person out to dinner and pumping him or her for ideas because
[02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:25.940]   there are tons of people who do this and a lot of people don't write books.
[02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:30.600]   I've known so many people over the years that have become financially independent in totally
[02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:37.820]   non â€“ in ways that â€“ so fast on ways that are not publishable.
[02:19:37.820 --> 02:19:44.980]   I know a couple that â€“ my family that started off divorced totally basically out of money
[02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:52.300]   because the divorce had all their money, started off, got remarried, driving a truck, lived
[02:19:52.300 --> 02:19:57.060]   on nothing, saved like crazy, started buying houses and basically six years later financially
[02:19:57.060 --> 02:20:01.420]   independent on rents from houses, never borrowed a dime and it was all based upon putting in
[02:20:01.420 --> 02:20:04.300]   skills and learning skills, etc. and things like that.
[02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:08.100]   That stuff is not in a book and I don't have a general book to recommend.
[02:20:08.100 --> 02:20:12.060]   What I would say is the place for books is when there's something that you're trying
[02:20:12.060 --> 02:20:15.020]   to learn how to do, to do that.
[02:20:15.020 --> 02:20:16.620]   I'm sure there are good books out there.
[02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:21.260]   Go to the library, grab 20 or 30 of them, flip through them, see what sparks your interest
[02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:22.820]   and go with that.
[02:20:22.820 --> 02:20:26.180]   But probably more productive is start with somebody that you know who's done something
[02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:31.140]   you admire and see if that person could provide you with help.
[02:20:31.140 --> 02:20:32.140]   All right.
[02:20:32.140 --> 02:20:33.140]   We move on to Alberta.
[02:20:33.140 --> 02:20:34.140]   Welcome to the show.
[02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:35.140]   How can I serve you today?
[02:20:35.140 --> 02:20:36.140]   Alberta, go ahead.
[02:20:36.140 --> 02:20:37.140]   Hi, Jeff.
[02:20:37.140 --> 02:20:38.140]   Can you hear me?
[02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:39.140]   Sounds good.
[02:20:39.140 --> 02:20:40.140]   Go ahead, please.
[02:20:40.140 --> 02:20:41.140]   Hi there.
[02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:42.140]   My name is Kathleen and I've listened to you for a long time.
[02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:43.140]   So I want to say thank you for all the advice that you've given.
[02:20:43.140 --> 02:20:44.140]   My pleasure.
[02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:45.140]   And Happy New Year.
[02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:46.140]   And to you.
[02:20:46.140 --> 02:21:00.900]   So I was wondering, I know you've given some advice about how to set up one's life generally
[02:21:00.900 --> 02:21:05.740]   in the past and I was wondering if you could help with some of the specifics of my situation.
[02:21:05.740 --> 02:21:06.740]   Okay.
[02:21:06.740 --> 02:21:14.140]   So I live in a small mountain community with limited career opportunities, but I really
[02:21:14.140 --> 02:21:17.980]   want to progress my career and contribute.
[02:21:17.980 --> 02:21:23.560]   And so because it's so limited in my area, but I really want to be here for the community
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:29.340]   and the people, I was wondering how to do that with being so remote.
[02:21:29.340 --> 02:21:36.460]   Well, the obvious answer is a Starlink dish on your back porch and the Internet.
[02:21:36.460 --> 02:21:39.700]   But I assume you've thought of that, so we have to kind of go a little bit more detailed.
[02:21:39.700 --> 02:21:47.620]   But basically the price of living in the middle of nowhere in terms of your ability to connect
[02:21:47.620 --> 02:21:52.900]   to the world has basically become zero because Starlink has transformed everything.
[02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:59.140]   And so now it's more a matter of saying how do I express my skills, how do I develop skills,
[02:21:59.140 --> 02:22:04.820]   ability, et cetera, and then how do I use the Internet to service those skills.
[02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:06.860]   How are you earning your living right now?
[02:22:06.860 --> 02:22:13.060]   Currently, I work in local government and I think I have lots of transferable skills,
[02:22:13.060 --> 02:22:22.040]   but it's a bit hard to market them since I'm basically a municipal bureaucrat that isn't
[02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:24.420]   in the private sector.
[02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:29.140]   Do you know, let's say that you are committing yourself that two years from today, I'm not
[02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:32.580]   going to be working in local government, I'm no longer going to be a municipal bureaucrat,
[02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:36.460]   I'm going to be doing my own thing, and I'm going to be doing it through an Internet connection.
[02:22:36.460 --> 02:22:38.740]   Do you have any idea where you would start?
[02:22:38.740 --> 02:22:47.100]   Yeah, I've started by updating my resume and contacting consultants in my field to see
[02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:53.540]   if anyone needs help and if I can offer anything on a contract basis, but so far I haven't
[02:22:53.540 --> 02:22:56.700]   had any response.
[02:22:56.700 --> 02:23:03.020]   Have you applied, so you're responding to job ads, to help-wanted ads, is that right?
[02:23:03.020 --> 02:23:09.060]   Yes, that's right, or just anyone whose work is interested, I kind of cold email them and
[02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:13.700]   say, "Oh, I think your work's really interesting and here's how I think I could contribute."
[02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:16.180]   Have you read any books on career planning yet?
[02:23:16.180 --> 02:23:20.580]   No, I don't think so.
[02:23:20.580 --> 02:23:26.680]   So there would be two tools that I would encourage you to do, and this would be probably the
[02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:27.680]   best.
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:33.740]   I wish I had, I'd love to spend hours with you on this, but the problem is that what
[02:23:33.740 --> 02:23:36.740]   I hear you asking, and I'll give you a moment to disagree in a moment, but what I hear you
[02:23:36.740 --> 02:23:40.340]   asking is a very vague question.
[02:23:40.340 --> 02:23:46.780]   The question I hear you asking is, as modified by me, "How do I earn money on the Internet?"
[02:23:46.780 --> 02:23:51.300]   And that's just way too big of a question for anybody to answer, because we don't live
[02:23:51.300 --> 02:23:57.300]   in the world that we lived in in 1980, where there was five or six basic ideas, five or
[02:23:57.300 --> 02:24:00.780]   six businesses that you could do, you could stuff envelopes from your kitchen table while
[02:24:00.780 --> 02:24:02.540]   living in a rural area.
[02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:09.100]   Today, there's virtually no business, there's virtually no job that can't be done over an
[02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:14.500]   Internet connection, and there are plenty of just mainstream jobs, customer service
[02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:20.460]   representative, you know, insurance company employee, claims adjuster, there are plenty
[02:24:20.460 --> 02:24:25.340]   of just straightforward bureaucratic jobs that would probably be in line with what you're
[02:24:25.340 --> 02:24:30.900]   currently doing, that are all done over the Internet, and in some cases your employer
[02:24:30.900 --> 02:24:33.780]   will just ship you a computer and you're good to go.
[02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:40.460]   Now, so it's too general of a question in order to ask, to find solutions, and general
[02:24:40.460 --> 02:24:46.380]   questions are very hard to answer, whereas specific questions are much easier to answer
[02:24:46.380 --> 02:24:49.020]   and they're much easier for you to answer.
[02:24:49.020 --> 02:24:55.860]   And so your number one goal is to try to develop a specific question and understand a specific
[02:24:55.860 --> 02:25:03.200]   job, a specific career, a specific industry, something that you are interested in, something
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:08.740]   that might provide you with the kind of work life that you're interested in pursuing.
[02:25:08.740 --> 02:25:16.060]   And so that's the essence of good career planning, is to identify some area of personal interest
[02:25:16.060 --> 02:25:22.340]   mixed with some area of kind of an external industry fit that winds up being a good connection
[02:25:22.340 --> 02:25:23.340]   to you.
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:24.620]   And there's any number of ways.
[02:25:24.620 --> 02:25:26.580]   So these things can be jobs, right?
[02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:28.100]   You may be into outdoor sports.
[02:25:28.100 --> 02:25:32.700]   After all, I live in a beautiful remote community in Alberta, you're probably outdoor sports
[02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:38.300]   available to you, and so you might find some kind of outdoor sports company that you want
[02:25:38.300 --> 02:25:41.940]   to work with, and they may need a representative or may need an employee, et cetera, but you
[02:25:41.940 --> 02:25:43.940]   have to have somewhere to go looking.
[02:25:43.940 --> 02:25:50.300]   So what I would recommend is that you begin with reading a couple of career planning books
[02:25:50.300 --> 02:25:51.980]   and go to your library.
[02:25:51.980 --> 02:25:56.540]   Years ago, I used to teach for a brief time Dan Miller's 48 Days to the Work You Love
[02:25:56.540 --> 02:25:57.540]   course.
[02:25:57.540 --> 02:25:58.540]   I think that's really great.
[02:25:58.540 --> 02:25:59.540]   It's still a great book.
[02:25:59.540 --> 02:26:00.940]   So grab a copy of Dan Miller's book.
[02:26:00.940 --> 02:26:06.140]   I haven't checked in on him in five years at least, so as far as I know, he's probably
[02:26:06.140 --> 02:26:10.460]   still there, but I don't know if he's still even doing his podcast and his business.
[02:26:10.460 --> 02:26:14.980]   But I would take a pause on radical personal finance content and go and start looking for
[02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:16.540]   career podcasts.
[02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:19.220]   And so 48 Days to the Work You Love is probably great.
[02:26:19.220 --> 02:26:23.300]   There's probably a dozen other new ones that I haven't followed in the last number of years.
[02:26:23.300 --> 02:26:28.260]   I would go on Amazon and go to your library, if you have a local library, and go to their
[02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:32.140]   career section and check out every book they have on career planning and read through them.
[02:26:32.140 --> 02:26:36.620]   I would go to, if they don't have a great selection, I would go on Amazon and I would
[02:26:36.620 --> 02:26:38.820]   purchase five books on career planning.
[02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:41.700]   You don't need five, but you'll want to just poke through five until you find one that
[02:26:41.700 --> 02:26:43.180]   resonates for you.
[02:26:43.180 --> 02:26:46.820]   And then grab one of them and go through the exercises, and one of those books will give
[02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:51.060]   you a set of basic analyses to do.
[02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:55.260]   They might give you some profiles that you want to take to get to know yourself, some
[02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:57.460]   psychological profiles, etc.
[02:26:57.460 --> 02:27:02.020]   They might have you create various charts of industries you're interested in, people
[02:27:02.020 --> 02:27:04.980]   that have had jobs that you're interested in, etc.
[02:27:04.980 --> 02:27:10.780]   And go through those books until you have some kind of more meaningful target of a career
[02:27:10.780 --> 02:27:13.380]   opportunity that you want to target.
[02:27:13.380 --> 02:27:17.620]   Because if you know that I want to do financial sales, after all, the fact that you listen
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:20.940]   to my podcast tells me you're interested in money, and you say, "I want to be an insurance
[02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:24.420]   agent," or, "I want to do financial sales," you can do that from your little town.
[02:27:24.420 --> 02:27:29.380]   A lot of financial sales is done virtually now, and so you can do that from your little
[02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:30.380]   town.
[02:27:30.380 --> 02:27:34.980]   But that will put you on a very different pathway than if you say, "I want to continue
[02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:39.540]   as a customer service representative for an outdoors company."
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:44.400]   And so you need to narrow in your focus on something that you actually want.
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:48.380]   And then when you have an idea of what you actually want, you should develop a specific
[02:27:48.380 --> 02:27:51.860]   career plan or a job plan to go after what you want.
[02:27:51.860 --> 02:27:55.200]   And that probably doesn't mean answering a bunch of help wanted ads.
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:28:01.100]   Help wanted ads are primarily useful to you as a way of seeing what resonates with you
[02:28:01.100 --> 02:28:02.780]   versus what doesn't resonate with you.
[02:28:02.780 --> 02:28:04.220]   And I'm not saying don't do that.
[02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:05.660]   You probably should do that.
[02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:09.460]   But your best opportunities will generally come when you're going after a specific industry,
[02:28:09.460 --> 02:28:14.660]   a specific company, a specific position that you have come up with the idea that this is
[02:28:14.660 --> 02:28:15.780]   what you want.
[02:28:15.780 --> 02:28:21.740]   And since you already have a job, you can afford to take the time to do this right.
[02:28:21.740 --> 02:28:25.860]   So my goal would be that at the end of this year, you would have a job that you really
[02:28:25.860 --> 02:28:29.980]   want, not just a random job that you stumbled across.
[02:28:29.980 --> 02:28:33.420]   And so I would begin with some career planning books.
[02:28:33.420 --> 02:28:38.660]   I would begin by taking some tests and some psychological profiles to see what might be
[02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:40.500]   a good fit for you.
[02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:44.700]   And as I've talked about in other shows, also just do an introspective consideration of
[02:28:44.700 --> 02:28:48.300]   what are the kinds of jobs that I've said would be interesting to me, etc.
[02:28:48.300 --> 02:28:51.840]   You can either do it with external testing or internal expression.
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:54.420]   But that's where I would begin.
[02:28:54.420 --> 02:28:58.300]   And when you can ask a more specific question of yourself, then you'll be able to get a
[02:28:58.300 --> 02:29:03.380]   much better answer from me or from someone else than just asking a vague general question
[02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:05.020]   like how do I support myself?
[02:29:05.020 --> 02:29:08.860]   The obvious answer is through the internet, but today that's everything can be done through
[02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:09.860]   the internet.
[02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:14.700]   So you'll have to find an industry or a job or a vision that you're actually going to
[02:29:14.700 --> 02:29:15.700]   pursue.
[02:29:15.700 --> 02:29:20.720]   Okay, yeah, that's helpful.
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:27.900]   I think I know a career path that I'm interested in that I want to pursue and the job I'm in,
[02:29:27.900 --> 02:29:33.840]   there's kind of half oriented towards that and half very, you know, bureaucratic.
[02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:40.920]   So I guess what I'd like to do is get to a job that's all oriented towards what I want
[02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:41.920]   to do.
[02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:47.560]   Yeah, I've been kind of trying to negotiate that in my current role, but getting some
[02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:52.600]   resistance and wondering if it's better to pursue something online.
[02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:57.440]   Yeah, the only other thing and forgive me, I am trying to move just a little quickly
[02:29:57.440 --> 02:30:01.040]   because I've still got several calls jumped off, I still got four others that I want to
[02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:02.040]   try to get to.
[02:30:02.040 --> 02:30:06.840]   But one other comment I would make is that if you can't find something that's completely
[02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:13.120]   online today, but you know you want to stay in this town, then if it fits with your family
[02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:20.000]   and where you are, etc., you might be willing to relocate for a time, especially if it gets
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:24.720]   you into a company that seems like it'll be a better fit for you.
[02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:31.160]   So in certain industries, working online is totally expected and it's totally normal.
[02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:35.460]   But you may not want to be a computer programmer, so you may want to develop other skills.
[02:30:35.460 --> 02:30:40.280]   In some cases, another strategy for you to consider, and I'm sidestepping any discussion
[02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:45.360]   of a particular industry and just favor of these general discussions, in some cases your
[02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:50.560]   best bet is to go ahead, go somewhere for a time, move to a different place, work in
[02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:54.600]   a company for a couple of years and then get the inside track on a job that would allow
[02:30:54.600 --> 02:30:58.180]   you to be remote and then you could go ahead and move back to your little town.
[02:30:58.180 --> 02:31:00.160]   So consider that strategy as well.
[02:31:00.160 --> 02:31:03.140]   And then keep in touch, call me back in the future and let's see if we can come up with
[02:31:03.140 --> 02:31:05.640]   more ideas as you can be more specific.
[02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:12.780]   Samuel in England, welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[02:31:12.780 --> 02:31:15.780]   Samuel, going once.
[02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:18.260]   Samuel in Nottingham, going twice.
[02:31:18.260 --> 02:31:20.940]   All right, Samuel, you're out of here.
[02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:26.180]   Margaret in, maybe that's the same, Margaret, welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[02:31:26.180 --> 02:31:32.900]   All right, no Samuel, I see your chat, I cannot hear you, so check your microphone, I'll come
[02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:36.660]   back to you in just a moment, I see and I'll come back to you in a moment, see if you can
[02:31:36.660 --> 02:31:37.660]   get it fixed.
[02:31:37.660 --> 02:31:39.820]   Remember that you can call in on the phone if necessary.
[02:31:39.820 --> 02:31:42.580]   Josh in British Columbia, Josh, welcome to the show, how can I serve you today?
[02:31:42.580 --> 02:31:44.580]   Josh, can you hear me?
[02:31:44.580 --> 02:31:45.580]   Yes, go ahead.
[02:31:45.580 --> 02:31:54.900]   Great, so I've been listening to your show for about eight years and I really appreciate
[02:31:54.900 --> 02:31:56.740]   everything you've done.
[02:31:56.740 --> 02:32:07.180]   My issue right now is I currently just recently had a newborn, job-wise pretty stable, government
[02:32:07.180 --> 02:32:14.540]   again, my wife works in the health authority as well.
[02:32:14.540 --> 02:32:22.380]   I feel kind of stuck in life, I don't really know what I want to do, I know that I want
[02:32:22.380 --> 02:32:31.540]   to help people and a lot of people have actually told me that I'm pretty approachable, I tend
[02:32:31.540 --> 02:32:37.620]   to take initiative to do things for people that people would never ask, but a lot of
[02:32:37.620 --> 02:32:46.140]   them seem to see me as a good candidate for potentially sales or insurance, but I don't
[02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:52.460]   really see myself as the kind that would push people to buy stuff.
[02:32:52.460 --> 02:33:00.980]   I probably just need advice on, I guess, life and how we manage to really just bring up
[02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:09.780]   a family and create your own business while helping people without so much.
[02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:13.740]   I'll do my best, and by the way, I've muted you for a moment, if there's anything you
[02:33:13.740 --> 02:33:18.140]   can do to boost your audio by, for example, turning off of a hands-free or something,
[02:33:18.140 --> 02:33:21.620]   that's fine, I was barely able to hear you, but I was able to hear you, but I'll do my
[02:33:21.620 --> 02:33:28.060]   best to give you a useful answer, but I would point out to you that your question suffers
[02:33:28.060 --> 02:33:33.300]   from the same curse as the previous listener, is quite simply that it's too general to be
[02:33:33.300 --> 02:33:35.940]   answerable in the first place.
[02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:41.500]   And so if you're just saying general advice in life, there's all kinds of advice that
[02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:47.140]   could be given, but you're going to need to develop more specific questions.
[02:33:47.140 --> 02:33:51.900]   General questions, again, can't be answered really by anybody.
[02:33:51.900 --> 02:33:57.420]   Specific questions can be answered by you, yourself alone, without any external input.
[02:33:57.420 --> 02:34:01.780]   And so cultivate the skill of asking good questions.
[02:34:01.780 --> 02:34:09.300]   The man who can ask good questions is really the king of his life and the king of society,
[02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:17.220]   because when we ask questions, we divert function, we divert attention, we control the conversation.
[02:34:17.220 --> 02:34:21.580]   And so building the skill of asking good questions is important.
[02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:25.700]   Now that's convenient as a segue for me to talk about sales.
[02:34:25.700 --> 02:34:31.940]   I think, first of all, sales is something that's not a great fit for a lot of people.
[02:34:31.940 --> 02:34:36.400]   And if you think it might be a good fit for you, then the best thing you should do is
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:39.900]   just go and get involved as quickly as you can and get involved in sales and see what
[02:34:39.900 --> 02:34:41.280]   it's like.
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:45.980]   But sales is great because it's one of those things that can pretty quickly show you that
[02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:48.780]   it's for me or it's not for me.
[02:34:48.780 --> 02:34:52.680]   Basically three months and you'll probably have a good sense of whether it's for you
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:53.940]   or not.
[02:34:53.940 --> 02:34:58.740]   I got into sales because I always respected salespeople and I always loved sales.
[02:34:58.740 --> 02:35:05.580]   And that's not super common, but I understood that somebody who could sell is a powerful
[02:35:05.580 --> 02:35:10.340]   skill and it's a very highly compensated skill, and it's a skill that can be transferred
[02:35:10.340 --> 02:35:12.540]   from one thing to the next.
[02:35:12.540 --> 02:35:17.580]   And there's a sales trainer, I don't remember who to ascribe it to or attribute it to, excuse
[02:35:17.580 --> 02:35:22.940]   me, but a sales trainer used to say that selling is nothing other than a transference of emotion,
[02:35:22.940 --> 02:35:24.820]   transference of feeling.
[02:35:24.820 --> 02:35:30.360]   And if that's true, I believe it's true, then that answers the question as to how could
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:34.980]   I pressure somebody into buying from me.
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:38.540]   There's a large misconception that sales is a function of pressure.
[02:35:38.540 --> 02:35:43.980]   To be clear, there is plenty of pressure that's exerted in some sales circumstances.
[02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:49.620]   But a lot of that is just an artifact of a past generation.
[02:35:49.620 --> 02:35:52.660]   I don't enjoy, generally speaking, sales pressure.
[02:35:52.660 --> 02:35:54.140]   I don't like it.
[02:35:54.140 --> 02:35:58.140]   Most people don't like it, especially in our North American culture, most people don't
[02:35:58.140 --> 02:35:59.140]   like it.
[02:35:59.140 --> 02:36:02.940]   If we were in other parts of the world, it's more common, but most of us don't like it.
[02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:07.160]   And it's just not really a particularly effective sales technique, because somebody who feels
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:12.100]   pressured to do something that he doesn't want to do will ultimately find a way to undo
[02:36:12.100 --> 02:36:14.420]   the thing that he did that he didn't want to do.
[02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:17.580]   And so if you're selling an insurance policy and you pressure somebody into taking the
[02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:19.700]   insurance policy, it'll cancel right out from under you.
[02:36:19.700 --> 02:36:23.620]   If you're selling a car and you pressure someone to take a car, it'll show up back at your
[02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:25.900]   lot and the whole deal will be undone.
[02:36:25.900 --> 02:36:29.940]   We know how to undo things that we can do.
[02:36:29.940 --> 02:36:35.380]   Professional selling, modern selling, is much more a matter of identifying clearly a specific
[02:36:35.380 --> 02:36:41.160]   need that someone has and then articulating to that person how the product or service
[02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:43.820]   that you have to sell solves that need.
[02:36:43.820 --> 02:36:48.740]   And when there's a good fit between what somebody needs or wants and what you have to offer,
[02:36:48.740 --> 02:36:50.460]   then selling is easy.
[02:36:50.460 --> 02:36:55.100]   And most of sales is just a matter of finding people for whom it's a good fit.
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:37:00.500]   And a professional salesperson, someone who's skilled, generally doesn't care that much
[02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:02.700]   about the ones who aren't a good fit.
[02:37:02.700 --> 02:37:05.880]   He recognizes this isn't a good fit and you just go on.
[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:10.740]   When I was doing insurance sales, my mantra that I repeated to myself was in or out, you
[02:37:10.740 --> 02:37:12.400]   know, now or later.
[02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:18.820]   And basically it was simply, is this the kind of person who's in and who I have an opportunity
[02:37:18.820 --> 02:37:19.820]   with?
[02:37:19.820 --> 02:37:20.920]   Or is this the kind of person who's out?
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:25.560]   If you're sitting on the wrong side of the tracks, late at night, selling life insurance
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:30.720]   to somebody whose car just got repossessed in the front yard, there's no amount of high
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:34.080]   pressure sales that you can use that's going to make that policy stick.
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:36.920]   This is not a person for whom life insurance is a good fit.
[02:37:36.920 --> 02:37:38.460]   And so this person's out.
[02:37:38.460 --> 02:37:44.040]   On the other hand, if you're sitting in front of a, you know, a thoughtful, future-oriented
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:48.520]   person who's got a job and who's working and who has a wife and a baby wants to protect,
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:50.640]   then life insurance probably is a good fit.
[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:55.320]   And so when you're a salesperson, basically what you're doing is judging the people that
[02:37:55.320 --> 02:37:59.720]   you're listening to and just trying to categorize them, in or out, and then second step, now
[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:00.780]   or later.
[02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:04.980]   So someone can be in, but not now, that's later.
[02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:07.580]   Someone can be in now or someone can be in later.
[02:38:07.580 --> 02:38:12.240]   And so in essence, if I'm a salesman, all I'm doing is trying to find prospect through
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:14.800]   people and I'm saying to myself, are you in or out?
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:16.040]   Is it now or later?
[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:18.080]   And then I just respond appropriately.
[02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:24.320]   If you find someone who's in and you find someone who's potentially in now, then your
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:30.720]   job as a salesperson is to figure out how to uncover very clearly the specific needs
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:35.420]   that someone has and then articulate how your product fills those needs so that they can
[02:38:35.420 --> 02:38:37.600]   see it and understand it.
[02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:41.680]   And ideally you only want to be selling something that you personally, passionately believe
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:46.960]   in, that you are really enthusiastic about, because that makes the transference of emotion
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:48.880]   really, really useful.
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:52.720]   So I consider that I sell every day.
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:56.800]   But what I sell are things that I believe in and I don't sell anything that I don't
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:38:57.800]   believe in.
[02:38:57.800 --> 02:39:01.520]   And if I don't believe in something, then I just, I don't try to pressure somebody.
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:03.080]   And just give a simple example.
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:07.000]   I think you said you're having a baby or hoping to have a baby.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:11.320]   And so it's one of the reasons why you're giving focus and attention to this.
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:15.200]   I firmly believe that all men should have babies.
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:18.280]   I think it makes them better men and I think it's one of the best things that we can do
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:19.280]   in society.
[02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:23.360]   We're facing an enormous birthrate collapse and we desperately need more babies in our
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:24.360]   societies.
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:25.600]   We need more babies in our lives, etc.
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:27.480]   I believe that passionately.
[02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:31.800]   But earlier in this call I received a question from someone who said, you know, I'm not really,
[02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:35.200]   I'm not really, I'm not, I don't want to have a baby.
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:37.580]   I don't want to, I want to be single for life.
[02:39:37.580 --> 02:39:41.760]   And I didn't try to come and beat on that guy and say you have to have a baby.
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:44.840]   I respected his decision, his perspective.
[02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:47.160]   He's going to make his own decisions on life.
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:50.400]   And it's perfectly fine for him to make his decisions on life that are different from
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:55.200]   mine just like it's perfectly fine for you to buy a Mac and me to buy a PC.
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:40:00.720]   And so I'm not going to spend any time trying to sell him hard on something he doesn't believe
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:01.720]   in.
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:08.000]   If I'm trying to sell the concept of, you know, having babies, then he's probably out.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.800]   And if he's in ever, it's certainly later.
[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:11.320]   So I'm not going to try to push on him.
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:13.360]   I'm going to answer in a different way.
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:14.480]   And that's what sales is.
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:16.760]   Good professional sales is that.
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:22.640]   And so some of the people who are the most successful at sales are those who are, like
[02:40:22.640 --> 02:40:24.920]   let's use insurance, a world that I know.
[02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:29.360]   Some of the most successful life insurance salesmen are the least pushy people you would
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:31.000]   ever find.
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.060]   Because I used to study under a guy who was a musician.
[02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:38.160]   He never wanted to be a pushy salesman, he was a musician.
[02:40:38.160 --> 02:40:40.440]   But he was a really good listener.
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:45.320]   And because of his skill of listening, he could accurately identify what somebody wanted
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:50.880]   and needed and then help to articulate in a very cool and smooth way, specifically how
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:53.280]   his products and services filled that.
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:56.520]   And he made millions of dollars a year because of that skill.
[02:40:56.520 --> 02:41:00.600]   And I think that's common among virtually all sales.
[02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:05.120]   I don't want to say all, because there are sales circumstances where pushiness, usually
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:09.400]   those are small transactions, you're selling a $20 painting or a $20 fake Rolex on the
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:10.960]   street or something like that.
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:12.880]   Somebody walks past you, they're not going to buy again.
[02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:15.800]   Those guys push, push, push, push because they're never going to have a second chance.
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:22.840]   But that's not professional sales, that's street sales and it's a very different market.
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:29.360]   In terms of general advice, I would say that your duty as a potential father or as a father
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:34.460]   is to build a large and comprehensive vision for your life in every dimension.
[02:41:34.460 --> 02:41:38.480]   And when you can see that vision, then you start putting in place the specific steps
[02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:39.920]   for it.
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:44.920]   And this is what is so great about having children is that it often forces you, in some
[02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:49.520]   cases for the first time, to think outside of yourself, to think outside of just the
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:50.520]   pleasure of today.
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:55.240]   And it forces you and over time causes you to become a long-term thinker.
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:42:03.320]   And so the skill of success is basically to envision what I want to achieve, then to put
[02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:09.760]   in place a list of actions or steps that could potentially help me to achieve what it is
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:13.880]   that I'm trying to achieve, and then start taking those actions step-by-step.
[02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:18.440]   And if you do that consistently, then you build the skill of goal accomplishment, goal
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:19.440]   achievement.
[02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:21.120]   And it really doesn't matter where you start.
[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:24.840]   What matters is that you continue practicing that skill and then 10 years later you're
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:26.720]   basically unrecognizable.
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:33.860]   Yeah, my pleasure.
[02:42:33.860 --> 02:42:36.960]   The audio is still low, so I'm just going to move on to the next caller, and I'd love
[02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:38.300]   to hear from you more in the future.
[02:42:38.300 --> 02:42:39.300]   Keep me in the loop.
[02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:41.960]   We've got two left to go here.
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:42.960]   Samuel has come to you.
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:43.960]   I see you're trying to fix your microphone.
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:44.960]   Hold on.
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:45.960]   All right, there.
[02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:46.960]   You're unmuted.
[02:42:46.960 --> 02:42:47.960]   Go ahead, Samuel.
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:48.960]   How can I serve you today?
[02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:49.960]   Can you hear me now?
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:50.960]   Can you hear me now?
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:51.960]   Yes, perfect.
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:52.960]   You're up.
[02:42:52.960 --> 02:42:53.960]   Great.
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:54.960]   Lovely to speak to you, Joshua.
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:55.960]   I've listened to your program for a long while.
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:42:59.140]   It's been really helpful to me and my wife, and happy new year to you and your family.
[02:42:59.140 --> 02:43:01.620]   And to you.
[02:43:01.620 --> 02:43:06.440]   My question is sort of about debt, and the specific question is how would you approach
[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:09.520]   reducing debt to clear it within two to three years?
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:13.040]   I'll give you a little bit of a background.
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:19.760]   So myself and my wife are professionals, probably have a joint income of about Â£170,000, and
[02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:26.320]   we have debts of about Â£65,000 due to sort of a period of unemployment, education, some
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:29.800]   maternity leave, and childcare costs.
[02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:35.400]   And right now we have an income of about Â£10,000 a month, but our margin is very, very low.
[02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:41.400]   So we have sort of expenses of sort of Â£9,500 thereabouts.
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:45.840]   And we're just looking to, we're expecting a third child, and just trying to look at
[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:51.160]   the constraints, looking at the constraints, how would you approach things in the future?
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:55.960]   What is your career, and like basically what do you do for work, and does your wife earn
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:43:56.960]   an income?
[02:43:56.960 --> 02:44:05.920]   So yeah, so my wife, we're both in the healthcare profession, I'm a medical doctor, and she
[02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:07.200]   earns an income at the moment.
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:11.440]   Do you expect, is there some way that you can make some extra money picking up extra
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:15.600]   shifts, working overtime, doing locums work, or something like that?
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:22.760]   Yes, so I really do that as much as I can within the constraints of childcare and my
[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:25.640]   contractual obligations.
[02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:28.600]   You mentioned $9,500 a month is committed.
[02:44:28.600 --> 02:44:33.360]   Why are your expenses so high, so structurally high?
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:39.160]   Because earlier on in our relationship, due to sort of education, period of unemployment,
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:44.080]   and some period of ill health, we had to take out some loans, and so those loan repayments
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:51.960]   and a car repayment eat up a lot of our disposable income.
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:56.320]   Whenever someone is trying to get out of debt, I look at it and I first, the first question
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:45:02.560]   I ask myself is, is this a debt that can be paid off by "standard means", or is this
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:06.200]   something that's going to require some unique circumstance?
[02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:11.040]   So there's one thing if a guy gets into debt because he's got some unemployment, winds
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:14.920]   up with some credit card debt, or whatever it happens to be, and it's just kind of standard
[02:45:14.920 --> 02:45:16.360]   amount.
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:19.600]   Or it's another thing if a guy winds up in debt because he's trying to start a business,
[02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:20.600]   or something like that.
[02:45:20.600 --> 02:45:25.280]   I've worked with clients that had hundreds of thousands of dollars of credit card debt,
[02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:30.520]   but the credit card debt was because they're trying to start a business, and if the business
[02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:34.200]   failed, they were certainly bankrupt, and if the business succeeded, they would be wealthy
[02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:36.160]   beyond their imagination.
[02:45:36.160 --> 02:45:40.840]   And my answer in questions like that is, don't worry about the debt, just focus on the business.
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:45.040]   If the business fails, you're going to be bankrupt, and if the business succeeds, then
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:47.720]   you're going to be wealthy, and you can pay the debt back easily.
[02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:50.840]   So a guy who's got hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt, and he's trying to start
[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:55.020]   a business, he can't work a little extra, he can't go and get an extra job and somehow
[02:45:55.020 --> 02:45:56.480]   make it work.
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:45:59.680]   There's no way to do that, it's not going to work.
[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:05.680]   And so he has to go for extraordinary means, such as make the business work and sell, or
[02:46:05.680 --> 02:46:08.040]   get investors, or something like that.
[02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:10.360]   What you're describing is not in that circumstance.
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:13.680]   What you're describing is just an ordinary situation.
[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:19.600]   You make 170,000 pounds, and you have 65,000 pounds of debt.
[02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:27.240]   That's half of an annual income, and that's not that big of a deal in the grand scheme
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:28.320]   of things.
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:32.320]   So I think that it's fine to use kind of ordinary methods.
[02:46:32.320 --> 02:46:38.720]   The first thing would be that you may not be able to, or you may not choose to pay it
[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:40.300]   off aggressively.
[02:46:40.300 --> 02:46:46.600]   You may only be able to pay off 500 pounds a month, and in that scenario, then it may
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:49.440]   take several years before it's paid off.
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:52.860]   And that would be okay, especially if this was the money that got your family through
[02:46:52.860 --> 02:46:54.680]   a difficult position.
[02:46:54.680 --> 02:46:59.240]   So you only have two areas that, if you and your wife are employed, you only have two
[02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:01.280]   levers that you can push.
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:04.600]   You have the lever of your income, and you have the lever of your expenses.
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:08.840]   So either you increase your income, or you decrease your expenses.
[02:47:08.840 --> 02:47:13.080]   So you should look at your income, and ask yourself, "How could I increase my income?"
[02:47:13.080 --> 02:47:17.320]   And I would encourage you, go back, I'm going to give your answer a fairly short answer,
[02:47:17.320 --> 02:47:23.760]   but listen to the podcast episode that I did just prior to this one, that was about how
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:27.960]   to save a down payment for a house, because I did about a 30-minute discussion on this
[02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:33.040]   exact topic where we discussed how do you push things up and down for a short period
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:35.480]   of time, and you're in the same exact situation.
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:41.680]   So in terms of your income, you can do a lot of things with your income that are short
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:44.000]   term that you won't do long term.
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:49.920]   So maybe you have a third baby on the way, and you are used to working five days a week,
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:53.960]   but for three months, especially before the baby comes, you can go ahead and pick up extra
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:55.800]   shifts and do seven days a week.
[02:47:55.800 --> 02:47:57.200]   I think you should do that.
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:00.960]   I think you can absolutely do that for three months, and if you could clear off 20,000
[02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:05.660]   pounds of debt in three months, or whatever it winds up being, because you work every
[02:48:05.660 --> 02:48:09.740]   single day, that's a great thing to do, and that's something that you should do.
[02:48:09.740 --> 02:48:14.700]   You should always look at long term wins, as far as how do I advance in my career, how
[02:48:14.700 --> 02:48:19.760]   do I advance in my job, how can I pick up extra shifts, how can I pick up overtime,
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:21.560]   and you should look at short term wins.
[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:26.040]   And so short term wins are extra shifts, overtime, and it may be side work.
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:29.660]   I don't think, obviously a doctor should be out, I do not believe that a doctor should
[02:48:29.660 --> 02:48:35.580]   be out driving on the weekends for Uber or something like that, but you should look for
[02:48:35.580 --> 02:48:39.920]   any chance that you have to make extra money, and generally you should look close to what
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:41.640]   you're currently doing.
[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:45.680]   So if you're in the healthcare business, but you can find something related to healthcare,
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:48.760]   focus on that, and then just work more hours.
[02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:54.280]   For ordinary debt, working more hours is a great way to make significant progress over
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:57.080]   a period of a few months.
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:01.140]   Then you should look at the stuff that you have, the assets that you have.
[02:49:01.140 --> 02:49:04.840]   So you may have stuff that could sell you, you may have an old camera that's worth 500
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:09.200]   pounds, you may have a car that's worth 4,000 pounds that you don't need anymore.
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:13.840]   And so if you could get rid of 10,000 pounds worth of stuff, and use that to pay off your
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:16.760]   debt, then now your debt comes down very quickly as well.
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:20.360]   And then in terms of your expenses, you go through your expenses systematically and you
[02:49:20.360 --> 02:49:23.080]   ask yourself, what can I change, what can I cut?
[02:49:23.080 --> 02:49:27.580]   And so probably if you and your wife both have jobs, a big expense is childcare.
[02:49:27.580 --> 02:49:31.800]   Could you renegotiate your shifts so that one of you is on, one of you is off on different
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:36.620]   days, so that you can care for the children and you can reduce your childcare bills.
[02:49:36.620 --> 02:49:39.960]   Maybe it's not for two more years until your children are in school, and then when your
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:44.020]   children are in school, then you'll be able to get this debt cleared off.
[02:49:44.020 --> 02:49:46.740]   Anything that you can exercise frugality over, you should do.
[02:49:46.740 --> 02:49:47.860]   Can you cancel the cable?
[02:49:47.860 --> 02:49:49.020]   Can you cancel the internet?
[02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:50.260]   Can you cancel a cell phone?
[02:49:50.260 --> 02:49:55.140]   A lot of these things that we think are necessary are not actually necessary.
[02:49:55.140 --> 02:49:59.420]   And so I usually want to look for big wins, but I'm going to be super, meaning, you know,
[02:49:59.420 --> 02:50:01.300]   can we change houses or something like that?
[02:50:01.300 --> 02:50:04.940]   But I'm going to be super cautious with you, with a pregnant wife, et cetera, you're going
[02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:09.500]   to have more constraints on your situation than someone else does.
[02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:13.660]   But you'd look, so don't discount the small things, don't discount the canceling your
[02:50:13.660 --> 02:50:17.940]   cell phone plan, don't discount the bringing your coffee from home, all the little stuff.
[02:50:17.940 --> 02:50:21.300]   It can add up significantly over time.
[02:50:21.300 --> 02:50:26.300]   And what I do and what I recommend is that you just basically focus on these areas one
[02:50:26.300 --> 02:50:27.460]   at a time.
[02:50:27.460 --> 02:50:31.540]   And so choose for each month a different theme.
[02:50:31.540 --> 02:50:34.700]   And so maybe January is going to be the income theme.
[02:50:34.700 --> 02:50:38.380]   And during the month of January, you spend a lot of time journaling and thinking about
[02:50:38.380 --> 02:50:44.460]   how do I increase my income in, you know, how do I increase my income to the highest
[02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:45.860]   degree possible?
[02:50:45.860 --> 02:50:47.940]   And is there some service that I can sell online?
[02:50:47.940 --> 02:50:51.300]   Is there something that I can kind of work extra shifts, et cetera?
[02:50:51.300 --> 02:50:52.780]   And then in February, you look at your expenses.
[02:50:52.780 --> 02:50:57.020]   So you track all your expenses, you go through, and you spend February focusing on how can
[02:50:57.020 --> 02:50:59.020]   we reduce our energy bills.
[02:50:59.020 --> 02:51:04.220]   And lo and behold, you're spending 180 pounds per month, when in reality, if you just unplugged
[02:51:04.220 --> 02:51:07.220]   a bunch of extra stuff, you could spend 100 pounds per month.
[02:51:07.220 --> 02:51:11.540]   So I would go down that pathway and I would say the long version of what I'm saying is
[02:51:11.540 --> 02:51:13.260]   in the previous episode.
[02:51:13.260 --> 02:51:18.340]   But this is an ordinary amount of debt that is not a big deal and could be pretty easily
[02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:22.660]   paid off in a year or two, but it's probably going to be a bumpy year or two as you try
[02:51:22.660 --> 02:51:26.380]   different things until you find some ways to earn more money and reduce expenses that
[02:51:26.380 --> 02:51:27.380]   work.
[02:51:27.380 --> 02:51:28.380]   Thank you, Joshua.
[02:51:28.380 --> 02:51:29.380]   That's really good.
[02:51:29.380 --> 02:51:30.380]   Helpful input there.
[02:51:30.380 --> 02:51:31.380]   My pleasure.
[02:51:31.380 --> 02:51:32.380]   Anything else?
[02:51:32.380 --> 02:51:42.100]   You mentioned in a previous episode about sort of your dad or your granddad in the past
[02:51:42.100 --> 02:51:46.780]   having sort of dementia or sort of memory impairment.
[02:51:46.780 --> 02:51:51.420]   So another thing that's sort of kind of playing is aging parents where you feel like you're
[02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:56.420]   in the squeezed middle where you've got young children, aging parents.
[02:51:56.420 --> 02:52:01.580]   My mother has similar condition, it's getting to a stage now where she might need some care,
[02:52:01.580 --> 02:52:04.100]   which we're not local.
[02:52:04.100 --> 02:52:07.540]   And that's sort of weighing me in my mind as I think about all these things going on
[02:52:07.540 --> 02:52:08.540]   in my family.
[02:52:08.540 --> 02:52:09.540]   It's brutal.
[02:52:09.540 --> 02:52:13.260]   It is possibly one of the most difficult things.
[02:52:13.260 --> 02:52:15.120]   Do you have brothers and sisters?
[02:52:15.120 --> 02:52:21.500]   Yeah, I have a couple of brothers and a couple of sisters as well who are more local to them,
[02:52:21.500 --> 02:52:27.500]   but I'm like the big earner and so it's just a bit â€“ people kind of look into me, but
[02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:28.500]   I don't have that flexibility.
[02:52:28.500 --> 02:52:29.500]   Of course.
[02:52:29.500 --> 02:52:34.420]   It's a bit kind of â€“ and I want to do more, but I'm a bit constrained.
[02:52:34.420 --> 02:52:36.520]   You can only do what you can do.
[02:52:36.520 --> 02:52:41.400]   The fact that you have a couple of brothers and a couple of sisters is an enormous blessing.
[02:52:41.400 --> 02:52:46.360]   The people who bear the load the heaviest is when you have a single child who's married
[02:52:46.360 --> 02:52:52.620]   to a single child and they've got four parents that they have to care for between two people
[02:52:52.620 --> 02:52:55.580]   and then sometimes they have their own children as well.
[02:52:55.580 --> 02:53:00.920]   And that's what's happening all across our society as our birth pyramids are collapsing.
[02:53:00.920 --> 02:53:05.260]   And so on a personal basis, instead of a parent having parents â€“ two parents having five
[02:53:05.260 --> 02:53:09.700]   children to care for them and split the load among them, they are having too few children
[02:53:09.700 --> 02:53:16.020]   and it's one child to five parents instead of five to one or one to five â€“ two to five
[02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:17.340]   instead of five to two.
[02:53:17.340 --> 02:53:24.020]   And then on a government-wide â€“ or sorry, a society-wide basis, the same exact problem
[02:53:24.020 --> 02:53:25.020]   is happening.
[02:53:25.020 --> 02:53:29.460]   We're having five taxpayers paying for the retirements of two elderly people.
[02:53:29.460 --> 02:53:33.860]   We have two taxpayers paying for the retirements of five elderly people or paying for the social
[02:53:33.860 --> 02:53:38.340]   services, the Medicaid or the health service of the older people, etc.
[02:53:38.340 --> 02:53:46.300]   So my thought would be that in general, most care doesn't actually cost that much.
[02:53:46.300 --> 02:53:49.380]   And so this doesn't have to be a financial issue.
[02:53:49.380 --> 02:53:51.140]   Are your parents in England or are they elsewhere?
[02:53:51.140 --> 02:53:52.140]   What country are they in?
[02:53:52.140 --> 02:53:53.140]   They're in England.
[02:53:53.420 --> 02:53:59.620]   So in England, you're going to have a situation kind of like the United States where, yes,
[02:53:59.620 --> 02:54:04.420]   there is institutional care, but what I'm referring to is the cost of care is primarily
[02:54:04.420 --> 02:54:09.580]   an emotional cost and a physical cost more so than a financial cost.
[02:54:09.580 --> 02:54:14.180]   When we do financial planning with people, the financial cost comes because many times
[02:54:14.180 --> 02:54:19.260]   elderly people are trying to insulate their children from having to provide the physical
[02:54:19.260 --> 02:54:24.660]   care and the day-to-day physical care that an aging person might need.
[02:54:24.660 --> 02:54:29.340]   And so in order to do that, you have to hire a nurse and that nurse can be very, very expensive,
[02:54:29.340 --> 02:54:30.340]   obviously.
[02:54:30.340 --> 02:54:34.500]   And so the cost is there because the bodies are not there or the aging parents are trying
[02:54:34.500 --> 02:54:37.020]   to make sure that their children never have to provide the physical care.
[02:54:37.020 --> 02:54:40.500]   If your parents don't have the money and you don't have the money and your siblings don't
[02:54:40.500 --> 02:54:45.380]   have the money, then obviously paying for the care is out of the question.
[02:54:45.380 --> 02:54:48.380]   And so the answer is we're going to have to provide the care.
[02:54:48.380 --> 02:54:52.780]   And that's where you're going to have to find a way that works among the five of you or
[02:54:52.780 --> 02:54:57.380]   however many there are and try to figure out what's best for mom and dad and how do we
[02:54:57.380 --> 02:54:58.780]   do that.
[02:54:58.780 --> 02:55:04.460]   And at the end of the day, you can contribute what you're able to, but you can't do more
[02:55:04.460 --> 02:55:05.600]   than you're able to.
[02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:12.100]   And so if you're away and they're all providing physical care, then it's your responsibility
[02:55:12.100 --> 02:55:15.380]   to spend more money to support them in some way.
[02:55:15.380 --> 02:55:18.220]   But of course, that will have to fit into your budget.
[02:55:18.220 --> 02:55:22.820]   So I'm kind of saying generalities, but just encouraging you that it is hard work, but
[02:55:22.820 --> 02:55:26.140]   it's not that hard.
[02:55:26.140 --> 02:55:32.060]   My parents were the primary caregivers for my grandfather and later my grandmother, and
[02:55:32.060 --> 02:55:35.820]   they did it basically alone for many years.
[02:55:35.820 --> 02:55:40.620]   And we children helped out when possible, but they did it basically alone.
[02:55:40.620 --> 02:55:45.620]   And so it's certainly difficult, but it's not impossible.
[02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:51.700]   And if you can't provide money, then you're going to have to provide care in your home.
[02:55:51.700 --> 02:55:52.780]   That's your responsibility.
[02:55:52.780 --> 02:55:55.820]   And so if that means that you don't have a living room anymore, but rather there's a
[02:55:55.820 --> 02:55:59.340]   hospital bed in the front room and that's where you care for the people, well, that's
[02:55:59.340 --> 02:56:05.260]   your duty to your parents to be grateful for their contributions to you.
[02:56:05.260 --> 02:56:09.940]   So again, I'm speaking generalities, but just to encourage you, bear your load, but I'm
[02:56:09.940 --> 02:56:13.140]   grateful you have siblings among whom you can share that load.
[02:56:13.140 --> 02:56:14.140]   >> Yeah.
[02:56:14.140 --> 02:56:15.140]   Okay.
[02:56:15.140 --> 02:56:16.140]   That's great.
[02:56:16.140 --> 02:56:17.140]   Thank you so much.
[02:56:17.140 --> 02:56:18.140]   >> My pleasure.
[02:56:18.140 --> 02:56:19.140]   Pleasure.
[02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:20.140]   And then I see the other name, Margaret, but it says Nottingham.
[02:56:20.140 --> 02:56:21.140]   Is that?
[02:56:21.140 --> 02:56:22.620]   I think that's probably your second computer.
[02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:23.620]   All right.
[02:56:23.620 --> 02:56:24.620]   Gail in California.
[02:56:24.620 --> 02:56:25.620]   >> Yes, it is.
[02:56:25.620 --> 02:56:26.620]   Yes, sir.
[02:56:26.620 --> 02:56:27.620]   >> Gail.
[02:56:27.620 --> 02:56:28.620]   >> Rocky with a lady.
[02:56:28.620 --> 02:56:29.620]   Joshua's calling.
[02:56:29.620 --> 02:56:30.620]   Are we going to call her at work for a test, sir?
[02:56:30.620 --> 02:56:31.620]   >> Yes.
[02:56:31.620 --> 02:56:32.620]   I'm on post for three.
[02:56:32.620 --> 02:56:33.620]   >> Sorry.
[02:56:33.620 --> 02:56:34.620]   Gail's on the other phone.
[02:56:34.620 --> 02:56:35.620]   I'm sorry.
[02:56:35.620 --> 02:56:36.620]   Gail's waited for a long time.
[02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:43.620]   Tell you what I'm going to do is, Gail, I'm going to answer a couple of calls that came
[02:56:43.620 --> 02:56:44.620]   in.
[02:56:44.620 --> 02:56:48.220]   I'm going to answer a couple of quick questions, and I'll come back to you, but I don't want
[02:56:48.220 --> 02:56:56.900]   to miss you when you came in from staying online for two and a half hours.
[02:56:56.900 --> 02:56:59.300]   So Gail will be to you in just a moment.
[02:56:59.300 --> 02:57:00.300]   All right.
[02:57:00.300 --> 02:57:06.040]   A listener asks, a listener on Facebook asks, "Thoughts on Christians reading the great
[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:09.940]   books of Western literature, Homer, Virgil, Dante, et cetera, and what ratio to the Bible
[02:57:09.940 --> 02:57:10.940]   is appropriate in your eyes?"
[02:57:10.940 --> 02:57:14.860]   Thanks a lot for an unusual question.
[02:57:14.860 --> 02:57:18.660]   I think that it's one of those things where I don't think that there's any reason to have
[02:57:18.660 --> 02:57:22.900]   to choose between them.
[02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:27.580]   In general, you can make enormous progress on most things with a small amount of time.
[02:57:27.580 --> 02:57:31.700]   So with less than 15 minutes a day, you can read the Bible through cover to cover every
[02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:32.900]   single year.
[02:57:32.900 --> 02:57:34.060]   That's easy to do.
[02:57:34.060 --> 02:57:39.700]   And so someone saying, "I can't read a Bible because I'm spending all my time on works
[02:57:39.700 --> 02:57:46.820]   of Western literature," is to say that I can't spend 15 minutes a day listening to an audiobook
[02:57:46.820 --> 02:57:49.580]   that's free on a bazillion apps on my phone.
[02:57:49.580 --> 02:57:50.820]   That's nonsense, of course.
[02:57:50.820 --> 02:57:57.060]   To try to understand the works of Western literature, not Homer, but Dante, you can't
[02:57:57.060 --> 02:57:59.340]   understand any of this stuff without the Bible.
[02:57:59.340 --> 02:58:05.740]   And so the Bible, even without religious connections, absolutely needs to be studied by anybody who's
[02:58:05.740 --> 02:58:08.540]   a serious student of history and of Western culture.
[02:58:08.540 --> 02:58:11.260]   I think there's enormous value in the humanities.
[02:58:11.260 --> 02:58:17.460]   I think that for me as a U.S. American, someone who's an inheritor of the Western tradition,
[02:58:17.460 --> 02:58:23.180]   that it is really important, if at all possible, for the life of the mind to understand the
[02:58:23.180 --> 02:58:26.060]   great books, etc.
[02:58:26.060 --> 02:58:28.540]   And I don't think it's necessary for someone's career success.
[02:58:28.540 --> 02:58:32.180]   I think people can live a happy life without ever studying this stuff.
[02:58:32.180 --> 02:58:36.500]   Not all people are intellectuals, but it's certainly helpful to those of us who want
[02:58:36.500 --> 02:58:44.460]   to engage in a life of the mind, to think about the big ideas, and we need more of them.
[02:58:44.460 --> 02:58:47.700]   So I think we can do both, and it's relatively easy to do both.
[02:58:47.700 --> 02:58:52.420]   I do think that there's often far too much Greek thought in Christianity and not enough
[02:58:52.420 --> 02:58:54.140]   Hebrew thought.
[02:58:54.140 --> 02:58:56.580]   And so this has been kind of a bone to pick that I've made.
[02:58:56.580 --> 02:59:00.260]   This is a very thing that a lot of people don't talk much about.
[02:59:00.260 --> 02:59:07.500]   But especially since St. Augustine, Greek thought has so infused modern Christianity
[02:59:07.500 --> 02:59:10.660]   that it's very hard to separate it.
[02:59:10.660 --> 02:59:15.340]   And the Greek thought is broadly pagan, and I would like to see a lot of the Greek thought
[02:59:15.340 --> 02:59:17.420]   replaced with Hebrew thought.
[02:59:17.420 --> 02:59:20.420]   But that's something that's going to take a significant amount of time, and I think
[02:59:20.420 --> 02:59:21.540]   it's an important thing.
[02:59:21.540 --> 02:59:29.020]   But obviously, in a public format like this, it's something that's going to need to
[02:59:29.020 --> 02:59:33.660]   be dug through, but I'm not prepared to do that extemporaneously.
[02:59:33.660 --> 02:59:34.660]   So those are my thoughts.
[02:59:34.660 --> 02:59:35.660]   A couple other questions.
[02:59:35.660 --> 02:59:36.660]   Let's go back to Gail.
[02:59:36.660 --> 02:59:38.660]   Gail, are you here this time?
[02:59:38.660 --> 02:59:42.140]   Gail, can you hear me?
[02:59:42.140 --> 02:59:45.620]   All right, I'm sorry, Gail.
[02:59:45.620 --> 02:59:46.620]   You waited on two and a half hours.
[02:59:46.620 --> 02:59:48.780]   I've come to you three times, and I apologize.
[02:59:48.780 --> 02:59:53.300]   That pains me to do it, but I will have toâ€”I'll give you one more chance, I'll answer one
[02:59:53.300 --> 02:59:55.500]   more question.
[02:59:55.500 --> 02:59:59.620]   Nick says, "You previously mentioned you kept notes for "summer camp skills" to teach
[02:59:59.620 --> 03:00:00.700]   your kids at certain ages.
[03:00:00.700 --> 03:00:02.060]   Can you elaborate on that?"
[03:00:02.060 --> 03:00:08.260]   Yeah, basically, I think that a lot of things that people try to put into modern education,
[03:00:08.260 --> 03:00:14.820]   curricula, et ceteraâ€”so there's a couple of arguments that I see that I think are both
[03:00:14.820 --> 03:00:17.620]   fallacious with regards to education.
[03:00:17.620 --> 03:00:22.940]   The first argument that a lot of people make is that, you know, "Why did I have to study
[03:00:22.940 --> 03:00:23.940]   algebra?
[03:00:23.940 --> 03:00:28.300]   I don't do algebra or trigonometry, but why didn't they teach me how to do taxes in school?"
[03:00:28.300 --> 03:00:29.300]   et cetera.
[03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:34.420]   And so many people argue for this intensely practical, career-oriented, daily life skills-oriented
[03:00:34.420 --> 03:00:36.500]   aspect of education.
[03:00:36.500 --> 03:00:41.120]   And what they usually want to replace with that kind of argument is they want to replace
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:44.460]   the humanities or the great books or something like that.
[03:00:44.460 --> 03:00:50.080]   And I think that's a very short-sighted argument because those career skills are not the fundamental
[03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:51.380]   foundation of an education.
[03:00:51.380 --> 03:00:59.340]   I don't think that being an educated person, acquiring liberty, freedom from a liberal
[03:00:59.340 --> 03:01:04.020]   educationâ€”liberal, libertyâ€”the goal of a liberal education is not to give someone
[03:01:04.020 --> 03:01:05.020]   career skills.
[03:01:05.020 --> 03:01:07.340]   That's what you do for slaves.
[03:01:07.340 --> 03:01:10.420]   So if you want to create a wage slave, then you go out and give them a bunch of career
[03:01:10.420 --> 03:01:11.420]   skills.
[03:01:11.420 --> 03:01:17.260]   If you want to create a free man, then you teach him aboutâ€”you give him a liberal education.
[03:01:17.260 --> 03:01:22.620]   And so I'm not on board with people who want to replace the basic fundamentals of a liberal
[03:01:22.620 --> 03:01:27.740]   education with, you know, basic career skills.
[03:01:27.740 --> 03:01:32.420]   On the other hand, it's clearly also the case that career skills and various practical skills
[03:01:32.420 --> 03:01:34.060]   are necessary.
[03:01:34.060 --> 03:01:39.480]   And so I think they're oversold that a lot of times, "Why don't we teach tax preparation
[03:01:39.480 --> 03:01:40.660]   in school?"
[03:01:40.660 --> 03:01:43.020]   Because tax preparation is really easy.
[03:01:43.020 --> 03:01:47.760]   All you need is basically 30 minutes with a tax program or a couple hours with a textbook
[03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:50.500]   and you know everything you need to know about basic taxes.
[03:01:50.500 --> 03:01:52.740]   And you can't really teach it 10 years in advance.
[03:01:52.740 --> 03:01:55.840]   You don't go and teach a third grader tax preparation.
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:01:58.860]   You teach tax preparation when somebody makes his first money and he's got to sit down and
[03:01:58.860 --> 03:01:59.860]   do his tax return.
[03:01:59.860 --> 03:02:04.980]   So how does a school waste hours and hours and hours teaching tax preparation when you
[03:02:04.980 --> 03:02:09.220]   can teach that in a couple of hours of focus when it actually comes time to do a tax return?
[03:02:09.220 --> 03:02:13.140]   And so I think the same thing can be applied to a lot of basic practical skills is to say
[03:02:13.140 --> 03:02:16.800]   that this is not something that needs hours and hours around.
[03:02:16.800 --> 03:02:20.980]   When I read these tweets and people talking about, you know, "They should have taught
[03:02:20.980 --> 03:02:21.980]   me this."
[03:02:21.980 --> 03:02:24.580]   And I'm like, "This is 30 hours of self-education.
[03:02:24.580 --> 03:02:26.420]   This is easy."
[03:02:26.420 --> 03:02:31.400]   What we teach in academics should be much more intense and should be much more enhanced.
[03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:35.580]   But there's a whole lot of skills that we do want our children to acquire.
[03:02:35.580 --> 03:02:39.500]   And so summer camp skills is one way that I have talked about that.
[03:02:39.500 --> 03:02:44.200]   And it's basically here are some ideas of things that would be really useful for someone
[03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:45.200]   to know.
[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:50.180]   And yet it doesn't fit into necessarily an academic year, but it should fit into a summer
[03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:51.460]   project.
[03:02:51.460 --> 03:02:54.980]   And so I do have some camps and things that I have looked at.
[03:02:54.980 --> 03:03:00.540]   First, I don't want to give my whole list, but I have a list of things like language
[03:03:00.540 --> 03:03:01.540]   camps.
[03:03:01.540 --> 03:03:03.300]   I think language camps should be a high priority.
[03:03:03.300 --> 03:03:08.100]   If you are a wealthy, you know, Argentine family and you want your children to get better
[03:03:08.100 --> 03:03:12.540]   at English, if you're not doing English skills at school every day, then the obvious solution
[03:03:12.540 --> 03:03:14.660]   is you enroll your children in an English-language summer camp.
[03:03:14.660 --> 03:03:18.380]   And it works kind of like any other summer camp of canoeing and hiking, et cetera, just
[03:03:18.380 --> 03:03:19.980]   happens to be done in English.
[03:03:19.980 --> 03:03:23.820]   But what I find is that English-speaking people from the English-speaking world don't often
[03:03:23.820 --> 03:03:25.360]   think of that, but they should.
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:29.840]   So enroll your children into a Spanish-language summer camp or a Chinese-language summer camp
[03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:31.460]   and give them a chance to use it.
[03:03:31.460 --> 03:03:36.780]   You may not move to China for a year of school, fine, but go ahead and go to China for a month
[03:03:36.780 --> 03:03:40.300]   or for a few weeks and enroll your children in a Chinese-language summer camp and that
[03:03:40.300 --> 03:03:41.660]   will be a big, big benefit.
[03:03:41.660 --> 03:03:43.220]   So I think language camps are really useful.
[03:03:43.220 --> 03:03:47.420]   There are a lot of skills that can be acquired in a really efficient way in a short period
[03:03:47.420 --> 03:03:48.420]   of time.
[03:03:48.420 --> 03:03:50.620]   So for example, I think we should teach young men and women to dance.
[03:03:50.620 --> 03:03:54.740]   I think that the physical grace that comes with dancing and just the enjoyment of the
[03:03:54.740 --> 03:03:57.700]   physical movement of dancing is something that should be done.
[03:03:57.700 --> 03:04:01.180]   But dance may not be something that you do all the time, but there may be a dance summer
[03:04:01.180 --> 03:04:07.320]   camp where a few weeks at a dance summer camp and a guy can come out being a very skilled
[03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:08.320]   Latin dancer.
[03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:09.700]   It's not that hard.
[03:04:09.700 --> 03:04:12.740]   And so you should make a list of your own things that you want your children to learn
[03:04:12.740 --> 03:04:13.980]   and supplement.
[03:04:13.980 --> 03:04:24.600]   And I think this is a really important structure for people who are able to provide their children.
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:29.540]   For people who are not going to homeschool, but who are going to keep their children in
[03:04:29.540 --> 03:04:35.360]   some form of just ordinary industrial school, then you should still supplement that with
[03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:37.700]   the things that you think are really important.
[03:04:37.700 --> 03:04:42.100]   And so if it's a religious camp to teach the doctrines and fundamental foundations of your
[03:04:42.100 --> 03:04:47.740]   faith or apologetics or dancing or woodworking, et cetera, summer camps are going to be a
[03:04:47.740 --> 03:04:50.100]   huge benefit for you.
[03:04:50.100 --> 03:04:52.760]   So that's the best I could do extemporaneously.
[03:04:52.760 --> 03:04:56.980]   And with that, I will close out today's podcast.
[03:04:56.980 --> 03:04:58.380]   Thank you all so much for listening.
