[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   This is Scott Anderson, CEO for Desiring God.
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.420]   You and other friends of Desiring God make possible the work of this ministry, including this podcast.
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.880]   Thanks for your part in helping us freely share the truth that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.940]   This week we are joined on the Ask Pastor John podcast with Dr.
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.980]   Richard Lentz, who is the vice president for academic affairs and the dean of the main campus at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary,
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.200]   just a short drive north of Boston. And Dr.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.880]   Lentz is also the author of a book that releases this winter titled "Identity and Idolatry,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:49.620]   the Image of God and its Inversion," which is published in Don Carson's Silver Series, New Studies in Biblical Theology.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.180]   So implicitly, Dr.
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.440]   Lentz, where we ended yesterday is that an idol is something that is not God and something that we cannot imagine
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.060]   living without. Is that right? That's exactly right. And it
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:10.280]   often points at and beyond itself to deeper needs you're trying to gain,
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.040]   deeper significance and senses of security
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.080]   that are there. And so often
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.420]   significance and
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.420]   safety are the two
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.920]   dilemmas we face with idols, idols in every age.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.060]   How do we gain security, safety in a world which threatens us, and it threatens us in different ways, and how do we gain
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.200]   significance? And I think the smartphone, just to use that again as the anecdote,
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.640]   tells us that we are significant if we are connected to enough other people's lives,
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.320]   but what we find is being connected to so many different people's lives
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.600]   we gain actually a greater sense of insignificance, and our safety is
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.400]   apparently or allegedly granted here because we are
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.540]   connected with lots of other people. That's our safety net, if you will. And when you pull that out,
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.160]   you begin to say to yourself, "How will I be granted
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.720]   security or safety without this?" And that's this dynamic of feeling a loss
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.200]   when you take the idol out. Yeah, that's a key definition.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.760]   Yesterday I mentioned a study that says that the average college student uses their phone nine hours a day.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.280]   So one of these college students comes up to you and wants to know how he or she can tell if their smartphone is an idol.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.760]   What are the diagnostic tests, the questions that you would put forward? Right, right. A couple of them.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.960]   I mean, the immediate thing is what would you lose if you didn't have it? Second would be what role does it play?
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.280]   Honestly. And third, how big of a presence is it? What's its function in your life?
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.480]   And so again, those are questions that are
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.600]   sometimes hard to answer by yourself. And so
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.520]   even the questions of idolatry and identity are communal questions and are best answered
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.400]   in a community. And surely
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.280]   the fundamental community is with God. But here with the smartphone,
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   often the dilemma is that none of those
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.760]   conversations
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.760]   appear to be very
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.920]   thick or rich or deep or wide.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.160]   That we have
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.400]   condensed the conversation to a
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.520]   you know, a small tweet, a short text. And
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.400]   so we never get beyond
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.480]   the temporary, the superficial, the
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:57.040]   impression. And it's an extension of the television age when we lived on the management of
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.800]   impressions. And so that has simply speeded up and gained
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.920]   momentum in our time. And so again being cautious that somehow there was a
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.760]   golden age back in the 1950s when
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.360]   we all sat around watching healthy television and had really good relationships.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.920]   I don't believe that for a second. It's in many ways an extension of that age that
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.680]   encourages us like a
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:36.160]   sleeping pill simply to accept the artificial and the superficial as normal. And that's the
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.520]   that's the key to ask the teenager or the person that lives on Facebook constantly.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.800]   What are the moments in life when you ask hard questions? When you
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.760]   think outside of the ordinary superficial details of life? And
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.000]   almost for sure not going to be because of a text message or because of a tweet.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.040]   Those are good diagnostic questions for us to ask about our phones and really any potential idol in our lives. Thank you, Dr.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.080]   Lentz. And one paradox of the digital age is that we are all connected together.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.040]   We're all linked via the web and yet loneliness does not go away.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.720]   So how are our relationships potentially being thinned out in the digital age?
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.680]   This is a perplexing question for everyone and I want to ask you that tomorrow, Dr. Lentz.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.440]   Thanks for joining us on the Ask Dr. Jon podcast with guest Dr. Richard Lentz. We'll see you tomorrow.
