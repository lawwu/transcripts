[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.780]   When you abandon the word of the cross and you abandon the gospel
[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.080]   and you come up with human wisdom, all you get is more foolishness.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.680]   Christ is the end of trying to earn righteousness by works.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.160]   If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.380]   and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.220]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.700]   For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:57.000]   Open your Bible to Ephesians 4
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.700]   and we have been in Ephesians 4 for a month, I think,
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.520]   but we finally have arrived at verses 4, 5, and 6.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.520]   And this is a very, very important moment to stop
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.200]   and consider a far-reaching reality that is clearly indicated here.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.940]   Let me read Ephesians 4, 4, 5, and 6.
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.560]   There is one body.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.920]   And one spirit.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.080]   Just as also you were called in one hope of your calling.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.180]   One Lord.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.980]   One faith.
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.900]   One baptism.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.820]   One God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.320]   Here is the singularity of Christianity.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.320]   Seven people.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.600]   Seven times you have the word "one" repeated.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:10.500]   This is a declaration of the exclusivity of the true faith, the true religion.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.920]   There is only one body, the church.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.340]   One spirit, the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.680]   One hope, that of heaven for those in Christ.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:35.500]   There is only one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.640]   That should make it abundantly clear that there are no others, no others.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.660]   We're talking about unity here in this section.
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.720]   And I just remind you that our unity is not based on inclusivity.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.900]   It's based on exclusivity.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:03.780]   It is the unity in verse 1 of a sovereign call, a divine call.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.580]   It is the unity of spiritual virtue in verses 2 and 3, the characteristics of those who
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.900]   are called and gifted by the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.920]   And it is founded on this creed, one body, one spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith,
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.120]   one baptism, one God.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:33.580]   And the one God is the true and living God, the only true God.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.800]   Apart from this truth, there is no hope, no hope.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:46.120]   Look at Romans 1 for just a moment, Romans 1:18.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.000]   "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.040]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.040]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.040]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.040]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.040]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.040]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.040]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.040]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.040]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.040]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.120]   You suppress the truth of the one true God, and you come under His wrath.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.280]   Verse 21 says, "Even though they knew God," - that is, God had revealed Himself in His
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.380]   creation - "they didn't honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.880]   speculations, their foolish heart was darkened.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.060]   Professing to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.140]   for an image in the form of corruptible men and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.360]   creatures."
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.980]   Let me tell you what that's saying.
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.200]   When people reject the one true God.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.980]   "Who has manifested Himself in His creation and in the law written in the human heart."
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:59.320]   When they reject God, when they do not honor Him or give thanks or worship Him, they become
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.680]   empty in their speculations.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.720]   The light goes out inside, they think they're wise and they become fools, and they invent
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.980]   false religion.
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.120]   Religion is not man at his highest.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.200]   Religion is man at his lowest.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:30.300]   Religion is an invention by man to replace the true God and the true faith.
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:38.220]   He is inexcusable because the manifestation of God is in the world and even in him.
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.840]   But when people reject the true God, they don't find Him another way.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.040]   They come up with religion.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.060]   They come out of birds and beasts, creeping things.
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.660]   They end up proud, empty, evil, condemned to wrath.
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.980]   Religion is not man at his highest.
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:08.780]   False religion is man in the sewer of human religion.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.960]   First Corinthians is another text of Scripture.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.740]   That is very important in this discussion.
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.040]   Verse 18 also, First Corinthians 1.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.840]   The word of the cross is foolishness.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.240]   There's that word foolishness again.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.660]   In Romans 1, they rejected God and entered into the folly of religion.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.220]   Here they reject the word of the cross, which is the gospel.
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.220]   They reject that.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.920]   And what do they get?
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.840]   Human wisdom.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.260]   Verse 20: "Where is the wise man?
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.260]   Where is the scribe?
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.900]   Where is the debater of this age?
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.820]   Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:58.160]   For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.600]   well pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe."
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.240]   When you abandon the word of the cross and you abandon the gospel and you come up with
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.440]   human wisdom, all you get is more foolishness.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.580]   Romans 1 says they rejected God.
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.720]   They became fools.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.600]   And they invented religion.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.920]   First Corinthians 1 says they rejected the gospel.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.100]   They became fools.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:30.860]   And they went in the direction of human wisdom, which is foolishness.
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.980]   But that's what the perishing people do.
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:39.840]   False religion cannot save anyone.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.600]   It is an operation of hell.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   Now, I want to go back to the Bible.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:52.840]   I want to go back to Romans 10, which I read earlier, because this is a key portion of
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.740]   Scripture.
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:04.920]   Romans 10: "If there was any group of people who we might say could reject the gospel of
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:13.360]   Jesus Christ and still make it to heaven, we might think it would be the Jews - " and
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.480]   I hear this from evangelicals.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.420]   I hear this from evangelical leaders.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:23.840]   We might say, "Well, look, at least they have the right God in mind, the God of the
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   Old Testament.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:32.920]   At least they have the right laws in mind, the Ten Commandments and all other expressions
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.440]   of it.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.020]   At least they're looking to the one true God.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.600]   Isn't that enough?
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.360]   Wouldn't that be enough to get them in?"
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:50.740]   Well, we can find out in Romans 10.
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.200]   They should have the best shot at it.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.120]   But notice how it begins in verse 1.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:02.380]   "Brethren," writes Paul, "my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them," for Israel
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.320]   - he's been talking about them - "is for their salvation."
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:14.240]   "I want their salvation," which is to say, they don't have it.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:22.340]   In fact, back in chapter 9, verse 1, "I'm telling the truth in Christ, I'm not lying.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.520]   My conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:34.200]   I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart, for I could wish that I myself were
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:44.120]   accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen, according to the
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.120]   law."
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.880]   Yes, they're Israelites.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.980]   They were adopted as God's sons in the old covenant.
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.420]   They saw the glory of God.
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.740]   They had the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple services, the promises, the
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.720]   fathers, and the promise even of Messiah.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.500]   They had it all.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.860]   But I'm telling you, I have great sorrow and unceasing grief over them, even with all
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.120]   of that.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.200]   Why?
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.460]   Because they are not saved.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.000]   And that takes you to verse 1.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.240]   It takes you back to chapter 10, verse 1.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:23.060]   "My prayer to God for them is for their salvation."
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.860]   They had no salvation.
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:35.720]   Earlier in the book of Romans, Paul said, "By the law, no flesh will be justified."
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:43.880]   No people were more given the opportunity to know the truth, to know God.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:50.380]   They were more given the opportunity to know God savingly than the Jews, especially when
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.920]   Jesus came.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:58.580]   And Jesus said, "I'm telling you the truth, and the truth that I'm telling you can set
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.880]   you free because currently you're under the bondage of your father, the devil."
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.360]   Jesus said, "Judaism is an operation of Satan."
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:13.760]   And when He said that, they were insulted and outraged.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:22.660]   And it led to them having the Romans kill their own Messiah.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:29.400]   In Judaism, there have always been Pharisees and fastidious rabbis.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:36.200]   They saw themselves as the very agents of the true God.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.520]   Many of them were venerated as teachers of the Old Testament.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.640]   They carried a certain amount of esoteric authority.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:49.340]   They were dirty because of the way they handled the Old Testament.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.520]   They were the resident truth-tellers about God.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.140]   But Paul said they need to be saved.
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.860]   So what does that mean?
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.860]   That their sins were not forgiven.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.400]   They were under divine judgment on their way to eternal hell.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.520]   "My heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation."
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.680]   What was wrong?
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.240]   They came so far.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.240]   What was missing?
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.900]   Well, verse 2, "I testify about them.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:30.200]   They have a zeal for God," right God, right attitude, "but not in accordance with," what?
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.040]   "With knowledge, epignosis.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.200]   Zeal for God, misinformed.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.120]   Zeal for God, misdirected.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.400]   And they sat under an eternal death sentence."
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:56.180]   That is exactly how all false religions are to be understood, all of them, Judaism and
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.020]   all the rest.
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:07.360]   They do not have salvation because there's only one way to be saved.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:13.280]   Let's look a little more closely at their condition.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.380]   The condition of people in all false religions.
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.180]   Here's their first problem.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.560]   They didn't understand the righteousness of God, verse 3, "for not knowing about God's
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.560]   righteousness."
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.160]   We'll stop there.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.820]   Here is the first damning reality.
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:36.900]   They did not know how holy God is, how righteous He is.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:43.160]   They did not understand that though in human life there might be degrees of righteousness
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:48.360]   and degrees of holiness, there might be a kind of a scale.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:54.880]   With God, it is only absolute holiness and absolute righteousness.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.200]   They failed to understand that God was so holy He was intolerant of every sin and punishes
