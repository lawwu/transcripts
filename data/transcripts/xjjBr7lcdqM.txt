[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080]   A question from Mukul who says, "It's been over a month.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.560]   My to-do list keeps on growing.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.320]   My productivity system uses Todoist, Google Calendar, and Notion, but for the past month
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.820]   I'm falling behind on my work.
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.160]   There are many days when I don't check my list or forget to create a daily plan or monthly
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.160]   plan.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.680]   I tried to reorder my mobile home screen many times.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.440]   Still I'm falling behind.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.200]   Can you suggest a way to be efficient with my productivity system?"
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:38.720]   Well, Mukul, I find it very hard to believe that your strategy of reordering your mobile
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.320]   home screen did not solve all of your productivity problems.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.320]   That's number one.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.400]   If you read my books or see my appearances, I really focus on icons on your mobile home
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.120]   screen and configuration settings in your productivity software.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.120]   That is the key.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.920]   You want to understand how Elon Musk gets done what he gets done?
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.440]   That is how he does it.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.480]   His icons are in the right folders on his phone.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.680]   I am, of course, being sarcastic.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.720]   I'm going to use you sort of as a straw man here, Mukul, to try to make some larger points
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.480]   for the audience.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.440]   What you were describing to me in this question is not a productivity system.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.160]   It is a collection of productivity tools.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:25.360]   So for you to tell me about my productivity system is to do as Google Calendar and Notion,
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.920]   why am I still falling behind and not getting things done?
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.240]   That's like me coming to you and being like, "Let me tell you about my exercise routine.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.240]   I bought a Peloton.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.720]   I own some weights and I have a rowing machine.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.320]   So why am I not losing weight and getting stronger?"
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.920]   You would say, "Well, you haven't told me anything about what your actual fitness habits
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.920]   are.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.080]   Like when you exercise, how much you exercise, what you eat, how this fits into your life.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.640]   You just listed exercise machines that you own.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.520]   It's the same thing that's going on here."
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.240]   So I think what we need to do is get back to basics.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.120]   You need to build a system.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.120]   Forget the tools.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.300]   You need to build a system from the ground up.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.400]   You need to start small, start simple, get a feel for that, and then you can start adding
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.080]   in the complexity.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.360]   You're not going to solve your problem of being scattered and procrastinating and having
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.800]   too much to do by jumping straight into really complexity.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.900]   Complexity doesn't solve your problem.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.280]   You need systems that make sense.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.480]   So the easiest thing you can do is if you go to my YouTube channel, youtube.com/CalNewportMedia,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.400]   I have a video on time management.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.320]   So I have this series called Core Ideas where I recorded videos on some of the core ideas
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.320]   I talk about.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.080]   Go back and watch my Core Idea time management video.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.120]   You'll get the overview of my philosophy.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.400]   For the sake of our audience now, I'm going to excerpt out a sort of starting point for
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.840]   you.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.200]   I think where you are now is you need to go all the way back to the basics and start by
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.220]   considering what I call the productivity funnel, the collection of three layers of systems
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.620]   that need to be in place to help you successfully navigate the universe of all possible things
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.360]   you could be doing at the top of the funnel to things that you actually accomplish that
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.960]   comes out of the bottom of the funnel.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.320]   In between those two things, mediating the universe of everything, what you actually
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.920]   do, we have three levels.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.260]   Level number one is activity selection.
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.960]   What is your system or philosophy for figuring out what you do, what you agree to do, what
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   you take on.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.040]   Below that, you get the organization.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.760]   How do you keep track of, organize, and make plans around what you have agreed to do?
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.600]   And at the very bottom level, you have execution.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.040]   How do you actually in the moment properly execute what needs to be done?
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.960]   When people are just getting started with time management, this is where I have them
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.160]   start and I have them start simple on each of these levels.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.680]   So activity selection, you need to A, probably clean the decks.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.680]   I'm assuming you're doing too many things in a fit of ambition.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.840]   You've just said, I'm going to learn this language.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.040]   I'm going to become a YouTuber.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.040]   I'm going to learn how to program.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.320]   I'm going to get promotion over here.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.320]   You can't cut that down.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.520]   You can cut this down to many fewer things and have some sort of coherent, simple, but
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.280]   coherent philosophy for what you agree to, how many missions you actually want to be
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.860]   pursuing.
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.020]   Maybe you have one in your current job that you're pursuing to help you get promoted faster
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.760]   and one on your side hustle.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.040]   Keep it simple.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.360]   With organization, I mean, you have to keep track of and organize things.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.720]   If you watch that video on YouTube, that's where I talk about multi-scale planning, daily,
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.480]   weekly, quarterly planning.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.760]   You could watch that video and you can start that.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.360]   Or it could be as simple as just, I have a place where everything is written down.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.060]   Simple Dave Allen capture.
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.680]   When new things come onto my plate, it gets captured.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.680]   I jot it down.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.120]   I have a notebook with me at all times and I transfer that over to my list or my calendar.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.120]   Nothing's forgotten.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.120]   Everything's written down.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.200]   You can start simple, just have something working there.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.240]   And when it comes to execution, how do you actually accomplish things when it's time
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.240]   to execute?
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.400]   This is where deep work matters.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.680]   This is where time blocking matters.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.720]   I'm working on one thing at a time.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.800]   And when I'm doing this thing, I'm not also checking my phone.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.880]   I'm also not also on YouTube.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.700]   A lot of young people, Mukul, I don't know that you're young, but I'm just assuming from
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.360]   your elaboration that you are, have this rough approximation of productivity where they just
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.880]   throw a lot of frenetic activity at their day.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.000]   I'm all over the place and I'm over here and I'm on YouTube and jumping over here and I'm
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   doing a TikTok over here.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.680]   Now I'm seeing this email over here.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.800]   How you execute matters.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.800]   Time means nothing.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.320]   Quantity of activity means nothing.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.080]   What you produce is what matters.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.320]   And the best way to produce is one thing at a time, giving it your full concentration.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.280]   So start with the funnel, selection, organization, execution, have an idea for each.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.360]   I elaborated in that video, start simple, but start clear.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.160]   What you're trying to do, simple systems, and you can start building up the more complexity
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.160]   from there.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.040]   But I think this is definitely Mukul, a back to basics, a back to basics move.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.400]   And if all of that fails, make your iPhone screen grayscale.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.800]   And that was a big popular tip back when I was promoting digital minimalism.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.360]   All the tech types were like, I know the secret to being distracted by my phone.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.920]   I figured out how to make my iPhone screen black and white, and then it's not as distracting
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.280]   and it won't pull my attention in.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.040]   It's all about if I just have the one hack, the one hack.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.280]   And if you're a tech person, it has to be a hack that's a little bit technically complicated.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.360]   Because then it's conceivable to you that this is why no one else is doing it, because
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.760]   it's a little bit hard to figure out how to change your phone in the grayscale.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.760]   And it's always a dream.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.440]   By doing one kind of complicated technical thing on my computer, I have the solution.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.560]   Same thing with golf.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.040]   It's all the one tip.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.040]   That's how they hook you.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:56.760]   It's like the, in Curb Your Enthusiasm, the weatherman had a golf tip.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.760]   This is kind of insider baseball.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.520]   I don't know if you noticed, the weatherman had this golf tip.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:10.600]   And so Marty Funkhauser was starting to tell Larry, the weatherman, who's like an actual
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.280]   weatherman, has this great golf tip.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.280]   And it changed my game.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:20.040]   And, I mean, I did this one thing and I've been swinging natural, my score is down.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.480]   And it's like a season long thing that he never gets the tip.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.040]   Because of course he accuses the weatherman of falsely forecasting rain so that he can
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.640]   get the golf course, like better tee times at the golf course.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.640]   So they have a falling out and Funkhauser says, I don't feel right giving you the tip.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.000]   And it comes up again and again.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   But yeah, I don't know.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Mukul's probably looking for the equivalent of the weatherman's tip for productivity.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.280]   That show's so good.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:52.400]   If your notion setup is just properly hooked with a Zapier script to the drafts install
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.240]   on your phone, you're going to be productive.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.920]   Well, the marketing for golf and productivity tools is like really good.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.080]   And that's what they try to hook you with.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.200]   So why aren't we, because there's all these professional golfers that like my productivity
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   stuff.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.840]   So why have we not brought these two worlds together?
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.040]   I think it's starting to, you get a lot of professional golfer.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.760]   You've gotten a couple questions.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.280]   Some of them listen to you.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.000]   That's what I need to do.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.200]   Deep swing, you know, somehow like meld those two worlds together.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   Do an infomercial.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.480]   You can start with tennis too, because the city open is going on right now.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.480]   Walk over there.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.480]   Test out your card.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.480]   Tennis players don't know me as much.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.240]   I haven't really come across a lot of tennis players who are deep work people.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.240]   It's similar to golf.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.240]   I know.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.240]   What's your problem?
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.240]   Anyway.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.080]   (upbeat music)
