[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   - What are you excited about right now
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.680]   in terms of deep learning?
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.520]   - I'm excited about the machine translation,
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.900]   even though I myself haven't made
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.500]   any direct contribution to it.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.640]   Some of my students are doing it.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.780]   I think over the fairly short term,
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.800]   we're gonna get much better translators.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.240]   And I'm excited for things like understanding documents.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.360]   I think there's gonna be huge progress there
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.840]   over the next five to 10 years.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.420]   Instead of giving Google some words
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.160]   and it'll find you all the documents have those words in,
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.720]   you give Google some themes
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.840]   and it'll find the documents that are saying that,
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.920]   even if they're saying it in different words.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.280]   And so you're gonna be able to search for documents
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.600]   by what it is the documents are claiming,
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.160]   independent of whatever the words are.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.760]   And that will be kind of useful.

[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.080]   (silence)
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.240]   (silence)
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.400]   (silence)
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.560]   (silence)
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:08.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
