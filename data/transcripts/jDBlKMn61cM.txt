[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   cohere our product, our company, that the whole point is really to undo those barriers,
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.280]   put it in more hands, make the APIs easy to use, accessible to folks who aren't machine
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.720]   learning experts, and then solve all those barriers that enterprises have to adoption.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.400]   I think the reason why it's taken this long to see the surface area of products and technology
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.440]   change with LLMs is because of mundane stuff like data privacy and people trusting these
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.600]   models and us building awareness so that there's actual consumer demand for it.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.160]   Consumer is going to choose the product that lets them interact with it in the best possible
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.160]   way.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.920]   In the same way that when I was graduating from high school, I chose my bank because
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.800]   it had a mobile app, and that's how I wanted to interact with my bank.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.760]   I didn't want to, I don't know, use my browser or walk into an actual physical location.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.440]   I just wanted it on my phone.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.200]   In the future, I think the next generation that's graduating from high school, they're
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.360]   going to choose their bank based on the one that they don't have to like call in to debug something.
