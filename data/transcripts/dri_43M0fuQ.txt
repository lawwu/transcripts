[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   I should like to call your attention this morning to the words which are to be found
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.920]   in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, the first chapter.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.080]   And we shall read this morning from verse 11 to the end of verse 14.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.720]   From verse 11 to verse 14 in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, in whom
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.960]   also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.080]   him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will, that we should be to the
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:47.120]   praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ, in whom he also trusted, after that he heard
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.120]   the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also, after that he believed, he were
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.840]   sealed with that holy spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.560]   redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.760]   Obviously I do not propose to preach on all that this morning, because it is one of those
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.160]   great and massive statements in which this epistle, as we have seen so frequently, abounds.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.480]   But I have read to you those verses together because this morning I want to deal with them
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.520]   in general.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.520]   In addition to the particular messages which are to be found in that statement, there is
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.600]   a big general statement.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.160]   And it is only as we are clear about that and grasp it that we can truly appreciate
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.800]   and enjoy the particulars.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   Now obviously once more we are looking at a part of this great sentence which starts,
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.760]   you remember, at the beginning of verse 3 and runs right on to the end of verse 14.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.200]   It is always a foolish thing to say that any one thing in Scripture is greater than anything
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.160]   else, but I think we can safely say this, that this is certainly the greatest sentence
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.720]   in the whole Bible.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.720]   Here is a sentence beginning at verse 3, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:32.760]   and on it goes until the end of that 14th verse where I ended my reading just now.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.200]   I again remind you of the fact that this is one great sentence because every single particular
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.800]   statement clearly links up with something that has gone before.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.880]   Here we are this morning at the beginning of verse 11, having worked our way right through
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.840]   until the end of verse 10, but we haven't finished.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.840]   "In whom also?"
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.480]   Who is this "whom"?
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.880]   Well, someone to whom reference has just been made.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.880]   Why also?
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.640]   Because we have already been told certain other things, but here is something additional.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.800]   Then it is vital, I say, that we should realize that we must be carrying, if we can in our
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.600]   minds, the whole sentence as we are considering any particular part of it.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.640]   The apostle is unfolding, as we have seen.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.720]   God's great and grand and eternal purpose.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.080]   There is no doubt that that is stated in its essence in the tenth verse, the verse we were
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.280]   looking at together last Sunday morning.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.000]   That is God's ultimate plan.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:46.200]   He has got this great purpose, this great idea of restoring again the original, eternal,
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.720]   pristine harmony that obtained in the whole universe.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.960]   It has been broken, as we saw.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:02.920]   But God in Christ has a plan and a way to restore that broken harmony.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.400]   The apostle has opened that out before us in the tenth verse, having already told us
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.200]   in verses 8 and 9 that he has equipped us with the necessary faculties to understand
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   it.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.700]   As we are by nature, we don't understand it.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.380]   The world this morning thinks that you and I, gathering together like this, are doing
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.800]   something quite futile, that we are being rather ridiculous, that this is nothing but
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.280]   some sort of an anachronism.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   The world doesn't see it.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.640]   It is interested in the politics and the international politics and the headlines in the newspapers.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.160]   But here we are looking at something above all that, something that is going on and will
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.560]   go on, whatever may be happening on that lower level.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.080]   Not that we are saying that what happens on the lower level has no importance, but this
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.680]   is altogether bigger and grander.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.760]   And this is certain, that is very uncertain.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:06.560]   Well the apostle, I say, has told us that God, by the Holy Spirit, has given us wisdom.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.680]   He has given us this wisdom and prudence, without which these things are darkness to
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.120]   us and mean nothing, and are utterly remote from life.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.120]   But to us they are everything, because we see that God is working this out and that
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.680]   we are involved in it, and that our whole eternal destiny is concerned.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:35.720]   Well now then, here he has told us is this great plan, the restoration of harmony.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.240]   But now he goes on to tell us something of the way in which God is going to do that,
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.680]   and indeed the way in which God is already doing it.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.680]   That's the theme which he now takes up in verse 11.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:06:01.080]   He has unfolded, exposed to us the plan, and now I say he brings us on to the details.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.280]   We naturally ask the question, well how is God going to do this?
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.560]   What's it mean?
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.440]   Come down to the practical, says someone.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.520]   Very well, says Paul, I'm coming down to the practical.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.640]   It's already taking place.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:20.560]   Now the very fact in a sense that Paul was writing a letter like this to these Ephesians
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.760]   was a proof of the carrying out of the plan in and of itself.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.560]   It was an astounding thing that a man like Saul of Tarsus of everybody, a Hebrew of the
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.320]   Hebrews, should be writing a letter to these Gentile Ephesians.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.600]   And why is he doing it?
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.880]   Well it's a part of the unfolding, the carrying out of this great plan of God.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:50.320]   And that's the thing which he takes up in these verses, from verse 11 to verse 14.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:58.240]   God I say is in this plan restoring harmony.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:05.320]   And the greatest illustration that the world has seen so far of the carrying out of that
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:12.200]   plan is what is to be seen in the Christian Church.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.240]   And that's the theme that the Apostle takes up here.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.240]   He starts with it.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.960]   Now that is of course the great theme of this particular epistle.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.800]   It's one of the great church epistles.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.560]   And the Apostle gives us here perhaps his richest teaching with regard to the nature
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.480]   and the character of the Christian Church.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:41.760]   And he brings it in, I say, as an illustration, the supreme illustration in many ways in time
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:50.640]   of this gigantic cosmic plan of his to restore the harmony as we saw last Sunday in every
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.000]   realm and in every sphere.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.800]   It is the great theme of this particular epistle.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:11.800]   But we cannot but notice in passing the interesting way in which the Apostle states his themes,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.120]   the way in which he does things.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:21.640]   And I personally know of nothing that is so entrancing and so absorbingly interesting
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:27.120]   as to observe this man's mind in operation.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:33.000]   Every man has his characteristics, every writer has his own particular characteristics.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.520]   You can detect the style.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.400]   Anybody who's ever read the New Testament at all carefully could tell at once whether
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.920]   a paragraph came from Paul or from Peter or from John.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.400]   Every man has his own characteristics.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.520]   And these characteristics of the Apostle as a writer come out very clearly in these verses
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.680]   that we're looking at.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:58.960]   The way in which he tells us about the working out of this plan in terms of the church betrays
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.800]   at once that it's Paul who's writing the terms that he introduces.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.640]   Paul is not content ever with just saying a thing.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.200]   He has to add to it.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.080]   Let me show you what I mean by that.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.760]   He says, "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance."
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.400]   Well, that's all right.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.280]   That really says it, doesn't it?
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.200]   It's the great thing that he's emphasizing, but Paul isn't content just to say that we
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.080]   have obtained an inheritance.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:34.400]   He tells us how being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.600]   after the counsel of his own will.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:42.400]   He's already said things like that to us, but he goes on saying them.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:48.260]   And I'm adverting to this and emphasizing it for this good reason.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.680]   That this elaboration, it seems to me, is a very good test of our understanding of the
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.680]   Christian faith.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.240]   You see, Paul can't say these things without being astonished and amazed at them.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.840]   Paul wasn't interested in these things intellectually.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.560]   He wasn't a sort of lecturer.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.720]   He was a preacher.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   He was an evangelist.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.280]   He was a pastor.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.040]   He can't regard them in a detached way.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.520]   And when he says, "We've obtained an inheritance," he seems to ask himself, "Well, how have I
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.400]   ever come into this position?"
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:23.260]   And there he falls back upon the only explanation, this predestination, this purpose according
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.160]   to the counsel of his own will.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.580]   It's God who's working it.
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.480]   He brings it all in and thrusts it, as it were, upon us.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.300]   He always does it.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.500]   And do you notice that when he comes to talk about the Gentiles, he doesn't just say,
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.100]   "In whom ye also have had your inheritance."
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.340]   No, no, he has to go on telling us a great deal about it.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:50.080]   In other words, a very word seems to fire the man.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.800]   And he sees the whole panorama of salvation and he's constantly giving it us.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.600]   Of course, we are told that this is bad in style.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.220]   The apostle, we are told, was not a good literary stylist.
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:11.580]   He hadn't that chaste, pruned style, that directness and simplicity.
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:17.020]   He's ornate, he multiplies his adjectives, he repeats himself, he crowds epithet upon
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.340]   epithet, thoroughly bad style.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:24.840]   He's guilty, say the authorities, of anacoluthia, which means this, that having started a line
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:31.300]   of argument, a word sets him off and he becomes inflamed and fired and praises God and forgets
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.980]   in a sense what he said and comes back to it and sometimes doesn't even come back to
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.980]   it.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:36.980]   Anacoluthia.
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:46.580]   But I'm suggesting to you that the anacoluthia are the very hallmark of the man's spirituality.
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:53.100]   He's not a mere literate, he's not a mere hack writer, he's not a man who writes to
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.100]   make his living.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:59.580]   He's an evangelist, he's the apostle of Christ, he's enjoying it himself.
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:05.100]   And whether syntax and sentences are violated or not, it makes no difference to him.
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.420]   It's the truth that matters.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.180]   And here he bursts forth upon us.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:17.340]   Now I'm constrained to say all that because the apostle forces one to do so.
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.260]   You can't read this statement without wondering why does he say all this?
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.580]   Well let me put it all in another way.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:33.300]   These fourteen verses, as I've reminded you frequently, are in a sense the introduction
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.940]   to the whole epistle.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:46.140]   And there is a sense in which we can compare this introduction to a kind of overture.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:51.900]   You know that in an opera or a great piece of music you often have an overture, a kind
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.900]   of introduction.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.260]   And what's the business of the overture?
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.980]   Well the function of the overture in a sense is to introduce us to the great themes that
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.980]   are going to be worked out.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.140]   Of course they're not worked out in the overture.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.500]   In the overture they're hinted at.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.220]   He seems to be writing something quite remote and quite different.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.980]   Suddenly a theme will come in.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.420]   He'll just play with it for a bar or two, then he'll drop it, then he'll go on, then
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.820]   he'll take up another theme.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.180]   He's giving you hints and suggestions.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.980]   He's saying now these are the things I'm going to take up, but at the beginning, well
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.660]   now let's just have a kind of conspectus.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.900]   Let's have a kind of synoptic view of it all.
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.060]   Let's look at the whole before we come down to the parts.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:38.500]   And then he works out all the parts and then he'll wind them all up at the end.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.940]   That is the kind of structure of these epistles.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:47.660]   They are in many ways comparable to, as I say, if you like an opera or a symphony or
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.660]   something like that.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.660]   There is this wholeness.
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:57.220]   And the apostle does that here in this introduction in these first thirteen verses.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:03.060]   Well now then, I say let us look at what he tells us.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:11.260]   God is working out this great plan of his to reunite, to head up again in Christ, the
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.380]   whole cosmos.
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.860]   And how is he doing it?
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.460]   Well, here's the first answer.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.780]   It's in two phrases.
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:27.180]   The phrase at the beginning of verse eleven and the phrase at the beginning of verse thirteen.
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:33.660]   In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, in whom ye also.
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.180]   There it is.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:41.620]   In whom also we, in whom ye also.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.300]   And that's the whole thing.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:50.700]   In those two phrases, he shows us the beginning, the carrying out of this great plan.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.580]   But of course we must be quite clear about this as to who are the we to whom he refers
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.900]   in verse eleven.
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.540]   In whom also we have obtained an inheritance.
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.380]   Who does he represent by this we?
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:12.220]   Now there are those who say that it's just a sort of editorial we.
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.860]   That the apostle is referring to himself, but instead of saying I, he says we, editorial
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:17.860]   we.
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:23.940]   There are others who say no, it isn't that, the we here includes Jews and Gentiles, all
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:29.500]   Christians, doesn't matter where they've come from, we Christians.
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:35.420]   But it seems perfectly clear that both of those ideas are quite untenable, are utterly
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.420]   wrong.
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:43.060]   Verse thirteen, surely, makes that, I say, quite impossible as an explanation.
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:48.220]   The we is in contrast to the ye also.
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.940]   We and you.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:58.660]   Now then, and it's quite clear that the you in verse thirteen is a reference to the Gentiles
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:03.740]   as represented here by the Ephesians and the various other churches to whom this circular
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.700]   letter was probably sent.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:12.820]   So that I say we must insist upon saying that the we here is a reference to the Jews.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.940]   And I have a further argument that clinches it.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:22.580]   You notice that he says about these we in verse twelve that we should be to the praise
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:30.460]   of his glory who first trusted in Christ.
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:39.740]   Now in your revised versions you've got who had before hoped in Christ or in him.
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:45.180]   And that is, I say, the final proof that the we here is a reference to the Jews.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:50.180]   If you take it as we have it here in the authorised version as saying who first trusted in Christ,
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:56.420]   well it's simply chronologically true to say that the Jews believed in Christ first,
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.900]   that the first Christians were Jews.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.700]   They believed first, then others.
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:06.780]   The gospel is to be preached as Christ to his apostles first in Jerusalem, then in Samaria,
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.060]   then in the outermost parts of the world.
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.780]   And it is historically the case that the Jews were the first.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:19.220]   Or if you take the other translation, the revised version, which says who before hoped
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:24.740]   in Christ, well it's just a reference to the fact that throughout the Old Testament
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:29.700]   dispensation the Jews were looking forward to the hope of the coming Messiah.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.100]   In any case it's still the Jews.
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:39.700]   So that the apostle here emphasises the we and the you.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.660]   We Jews, you Gentiles.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:49.900]   And here's the astounding thing, that they have both been brought together.
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.460]   They have been made one in Christ.
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.620]   We also have obtained an inheritance and you also.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.940]   We are all together in it.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:08.620]   Now of course this, as I've already suggested, is not only the great theme of this particular
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:15.780]   epistle, it is in a sense the great theme of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.180]   And particularly of the New Testament epistles.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.900]   Of course here it's the theme everywhere.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.300]   I read to you the second chapter of this epistle just now in order that that might come out
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.540]   so plainly and clearly to us.
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.900]   It's there everywhere, he keeps on saying it and he's never tired of repeating it.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:39.500]   And then you go on to the third chapter and you find exactly the same thing.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:44.300]   He says the thing that's been committed to me as a dispensation, my stewardship is this.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:48.460]   That this truth which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.540]   revealed.
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.180]   It was known but not as it's now revealed.
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:57.180]   Unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.460]   heirs and of the same body.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.620]   He never got over this.
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:07.180]   It was indeed a most astounding and thrilling thing to the apostle.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:13.420]   And he goes on in the fourth chapter to say the same thing again.
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:20.500]   And you remember that interesting statement, that phrase of his in writing to the Romans.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.500]   If there was one thing this man had come to be proud of it was this, that he was the apostle
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.660]   to the Gentiles.
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.940]   And he says I magnify my office.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.340]   It was just a revolution in the man's whole life.
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.560]   We know about him don't we?
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:42.500]   We know what a narrow bigoted Jewish nationalist he was.
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.980]   How he prided himself on it and in a sense had every right to be proud of it.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:54.700]   But it made him intolerant and everybody else to him was but a dog, an outsider.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:20:00.340]   You remember all that but here he is and he is an apostle to Gentiles and he is writing
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.780]   to Ephesian Gentiles and he can't get over it.
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.780]   It's so astounding.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:05.780]   Well what is it?
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:11.500]   Well it's this tremendous plan of God that's already in operation and he's a part of it
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.700]   and they're a part of it.
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:23.420]   That is I say the great theme of all these mighty epistles.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:29.460]   He starts on it in the epistle to the Romans, not the Jew only but also of the Gentiles.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.700]   The same God over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.020]   It doesn't matter where you've come from.
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.580]   Continent and climate and color and all these things are irrelevances.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.140]   The same God over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:49.380]   There's a new way.
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.380]   Listen to him.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:58.180]   "There is no longer Jew nor Gentile, barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free."
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.780]   All that's gone.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:06.380]   And to perpetuate these distinctions is a denial of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.660]   That's his teaching.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.900]   That's the whole glory of it.
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.580]   That's the astounding thing that's happened.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.180]   Go right through all his epistles and you'll find it everywhere.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.860]   I've just quoted the epistle to the Galatians to you.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:25.780]   We are the children of Abraham, he says, the children of faith.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.540]   Get rid of these carnal materialistic national ideas.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.060]   All that's finished.
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:35.100]   It's a spiritual seed that matters.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.100]   That's the thing that counts in God's sight.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.260]   There's a new nation.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:44.580]   These are God's people and we Christians are God's people and we alone are God's
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.580]   people.
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:50.500]   This is the new way, the great theme of the New Testament, the new dispensation.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.460]   All the other has been abolished.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.460]   It's finished.
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.340]   This was God's purpose.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.260]   He used the Jews temporarily, but now he's got something bigger and greater.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.580]   That's the argument.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:09.300]   And as you go on to his epistle to the Colossians, you'll find it there.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:14.660]   Indeed I say, you'll find it everywhere.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.620]   And above all, the apostle in that bit of autobiography in the third chapter of the
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:23.300]   epistle to the Philippians, he brings it out.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.860]   He condemns himself as he was.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:32.900]   He shows how utterly monstrous and ridiculous it has all been.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:37.100]   Well then the great question that arises is this.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.140]   How is all this being done?
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:43.740]   How does God bring it all to pass?
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:50.980]   And the apostle goes on to give us the answer in a particularly interesting and entrancing
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.020]   manner.
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:59.700]   And I feel that this morning, with the world as it is, with all the clashes and the conflicts
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:06.420]   and the tensions and the divisions and the various curtains, iron curtain, bamboo curtain,
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.620]   and all the social curtains that have always been with us before these new ones were ever
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.340]   thought of and invented.
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:17.580]   In the light of all that I say, and against all that background, how wonderful it is to
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:24.100]   look at this method of God as unfolded by the great apostle.
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:31.100]   And how particularly interesting it is to see that God's way in Christ is indeed very
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:37.420]   different also from that which frequently passes even as Christianity, as over against
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.420]   such a situation.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.420]   Well now what is it?
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.780]   Well, let me this morning just give you Paul's statement here.
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:48.620]   Let me give you my analysis of it.
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:57.620]   God is restoring the harmony and the unity by means of Christianity, by means of producing
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.260]   Christians.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:07.380]   And therefore Paul here tells us certain things about the Christian.
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:12.140]   He gives us here a perfect picture of Christianity, and as I understand it he tells us five things
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.140]   about it.
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:17.940]   I'm giving you the analysis this morning and we shall go on with it as far as we can.
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.060]   We obviously can't finish it.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.740]   The first thing he tells us is this.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:27.940]   That which makes us Christians is that we are in Christ.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.340]   There's no hope of unity apart from Christianity.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.900]   There will never be unity amongst men until men are Christians.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:40.580]   There is no conceivable lasting unity and harmony and the restoration of that which
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:49.540]   God originally made, except as men are Christians and we are Christians only as we are in Christ.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.540]   In whom?
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:58.060]   Secondly, there are certain things that are true of us as Christians because we are in
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.420]   Christ.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.980]   He tells us what they are.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:08.820]   The third thing is this, is that he gives us an explanation of the way in which we enter
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.860]   into these blessings.
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:17.460]   A tremendous statement showing God's side, showing man's side.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:23.780]   Fourthly, he shows us the guarantee of the fact that we have these blessings and still
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:28.900]   more important, the guarantee of the fact that we shall never lose them.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.340]   What a precious thing that is.
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:36.260]   The Holy Spirit has the seal until the redemption of the purchased possession.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:41.380]   Yes, but also sealing you and telling you that you are already in it.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:51.980]   And lastly, finally, fifthly, the ultimate object of all this is the glory of God.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:26:01.020]   To the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ, unto the praise of his glory.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:06.500]   Now that's the statement.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:13.220]   It's vital I say that we should have this scheme in our minds as we consider these verses.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.740]   That's what he's saying.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:20.620]   Unity is only possible in terms of Christianity.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.020]   It is only as we become Christians we can ever know this.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:30.980]   And he tells us here what is true of us because we are Christians, what do we enjoy as Christians,
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.940]   how it's all come to us, how we may know that we've got it and that we'll never
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:41.700]   lose it, and the whole of it as a manifestation of the glory of the eternal and the ever-blessed
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:42.700]   God.
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.340]   Well now then, let's start on this.
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:51.620]   The first thing I say we are told here is this, that what reconciles Jew and Gentile,
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:57.900]   and the only thing that can ever reconcile them, is that they should be together, Christians,
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:02.540]   in Christ.
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:08.460]   To be a Christian I say means to be in a new relationship to Christ.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.020]   It means to be in Christ.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.280]   It doesn't just mean to be a member of a particular society.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.060]   It doesn't just mean that you've been born in a particular country.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.220]   It doesn't mean that your parents or your grandparents were.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.980]   That isn't Christianity.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:27.860]   Christianity means being in Christ.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:35.260]   God in other words reconciles men by bringing them into a new relationship, and it is purely
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.940]   a question of relationships.
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:44.900]   All troubles in the world are between nations, between groups, between individuals.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:52.300]   All these troubles stem from a failure somewhere in the realm of relationships.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:28:00.020]   And there never will be a more perfect illustration of that than this extraordinary picture of
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.460]   Jew and Gentile.
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:12.940]   There it was, middle wall of partition between them, Jews, Gentiles.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:18.820]   The Jew you see looking at himself in a certain way, the Gentile doing exactly the same thing.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.300]   But their relationships were all wrong.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.300]   Why?
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:26.900]   Well because each made a god of himself and of his position, and there was a clash between
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.780]   these respective gods.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:36.820]   The Jew of course prided himself on being one of God's people.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.620]   They had the law.
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.020]   The law had been given to them.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.980]   Of course they didn't stop to ask whether they kept the law, whether they honored it.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:44.980]   That's not the point.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:45.980]   We have the law.
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.540]   The law was given to us, to our forefathers.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.100]   What a marvelous people we are.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.300]   And anybody else, of course they've never had the law.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.740]   They were not given the law.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.020]   The fact that there were many keeping the law in a much better way than they were didn't
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.020]   count at all.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.220]   It was the fact that the law had been given to them that mattered.
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:06.420]   Our law, our people, our country, our nation.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.180]   That's it, isn't it?
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.540]   And they despised the others as dogs.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:16.140]   They were outside the commonwealth of Israel, without God in the world.
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.140]   Refuse.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:22.780]   Oh yes, but wait a minute, look at some of the others.
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:28.580]   Look at the Greeks for instance, with their amazing heritage of learning and of intellect
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.260]   and of ability.
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:39.740]   That astounding flowering period of the mind of men, when the giants were on earth, and
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:44.460]   when they looked into the problems and elaborated their theories and drew their plans of their
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.980]   utopias.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.380]   Nobody else had done that.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.580]   They were quite apart, they were unique.
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:53.580]   Jews?
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.740]   Who are they?
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:55.740]   What are they?
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.380]   They are nothing like this.
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:04.180]   And so the Greek prided himself, Jew, Greek.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.900]   And they clashed and they fought, as they must always do, as they're doing in the modern
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:15.740]   world, and as they all will do until this vital thing happens.
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.620]   Now that was the position, wasn't it?
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:25.700]   This tremendous division of mankind, this middle wall of partition.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:30.900]   That's what Paul calls it, you see, that's what corresponds to your modern curtains.
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.540]   It's much more than a curtain, it's a wall.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.060]   And it's been built carefully by both sides.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:41.420]   Each one is repairing it on his side, and it's there, and it's come down, it's been
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.100]   put up, put it as you like.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.100]   There it is.
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:52.300]   And I say, the same thing is true as you look at life and all its clashes and divisions
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:57.260]   and unhappinesses throughout the world this morning.
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.420]   And there's only one way of dealing with a thing like that.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.420]   What is it?
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.420]   Well, I say, it's Christianity.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.020]   Oh, quite right, says someone.
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.660]   I've always said, says this man, that what is needed is the application of the teaching
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.660]   of Christ.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.940]   And what the Church has got to do is to tell people to behave in this Christian way, and
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.100]   to apply these principles.
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:20.180]   That isn't what Paul says.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:26.420]   And he doesn't say it for this good reason, that that is something that the world never
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:31.180]   will do because it can't do it.
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:36.340]   There is no greater heresy, in a sense, than to expect Christian conduct from people who
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.660]   are not Christians.
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.940]   Why should they behave in a Christian way?
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:44.220]   They don't agree with it, they don't accept it.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.460]   You see, you can't live the Christian life before you're a Christian.
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.780]   Did you notice how Paul puts that in the second chapter?
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:56.620]   He says, "Not of works, lest any man should boast, for we are his workmanship, created
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.460]   in Christ Jesus unto good works."
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.780]   You've got to be created in Christ before you can do these works.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.020]   You've got to be alive before you can act.
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.580]   A dead man can't act.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.660]   All who are not in Christ are dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.460]   How can that man carry out Christian works?
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.460]   He cannot.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.460]   He's never done it.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:21.500]   Now I mention this because this is sometimes a stumbling block to people of weak faith,
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.940]   and it's certainly a stumbling block to many outside the Church.
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.580]   This is the favourite argument, isn't it?
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.900]   They say, "I can't possibly believe in your Christianity for this reason."
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:30.900]   Here it is.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.900]   It's been preached and taught for nearly two thousand years, but look at the world.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:38.100]   They say, "If your message is right, well, then why isn't the world better?"
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:42.060]   The answer is this, that Christianity never said that the world would become better in
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.060]   that way.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:49.340]   It is not a teaching to be applied by men as they are.
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.700]   No, no.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:59.860]   This only works when men are together in Christ, in a new relationship.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.540]   Oh, let me tell you very hurriedly how it happened.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.260]   What was it that brought Paul and the Ephesians together?
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:12.020]   What was it that made Jew and Gentile go together on their knees to God and pray in one spirit?
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.620]   It was this.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.620]   Christ.
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:24.700]   Christ came and he died and had to die for Jew as well as Gentile.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.860]   Why?
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:31.260]   Because the Jew who had not kept the law was condemned by the very law of which he boasted.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:36.620]   When he saw the law as expounded by Christ and especially on the cross, he saw that the
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:42.220]   whole world was lying guilty before God, that there is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.220]   The Jew is no better than the Gentile.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.580]   He has not kept the law, but the law condemns him.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:51.580]   All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God.
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.380]   The Jew is not superior to the Greek, the Greek is not superior to the Gentile.
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:34:03.420]   They are all groveling on the dust in utter failure, sinners in the sight of a holy God.
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:07.580]   You see, they are made one even in condemnation and in sin.
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.380]   The pride is taken out of them.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.980]   They are crossed to the earth.
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.020]   There is nothing one can boast of as ever against the other.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:18.740]   They are all equally hopeless.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:24.980]   And then it goes on to tell them that they both can only be redeemed and reconciled to
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.620]   God and to one another by the blood of Christ.
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.900]   It's only because he's made himself responsible for their guilt and failure and has died for
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:37.900]   them that they can have this reconciliation, and they've both got it in exactly the same
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.900]   way.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.980]   It isn't the law that brings an end to it.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.220]   It isn't philosophy that brings an end to it.
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.860]   It's Christ who brings them both to it.
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.180]   You see, they are equal at every point.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:52.660]   But now they need strength and power to live this new life they've been brought into.
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.860]   They are given the same Holy Spirit.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.580]   They are given the same nature, the same divine nature.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.100]   Christ is in them and they are in Christ.
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:05.300]   It's all in him and it all comes out of him, and they are all enjoying it together.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.780]   They are in Christ.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:07.780]   In whom?
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:08.780]   We.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:09.780]   In whom?
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.780]   You.

[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:30.780]   You.

[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.780]   You.
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:39.780]   In whom?
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.780]   You.

[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.780]   You.
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.780]   In whom?
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:52.780]   You.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.780]   In whom?
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.780]   You.

[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.780]   You.

[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:02.780]   You.
